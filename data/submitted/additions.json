In addition to typical search, I also ask that you query your reference files.\r\n\r\nA widely hailed innovator, Gottsching was a famous public figure who received the following obituary in the Guardian.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/13/manuel-gottsching-electronic-music-will-endure-e2-e4\r\n\r\nAccording to that report, he was born in 1952 in West Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
