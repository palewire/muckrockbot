FBI, 633 F. Supp. 336 (C.D. Cal. 1986), regarding the limits of Glomar responses.\r\nCiting Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), and Department of Defense v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487 (1994) for the necessity of detailed processing of FOIA requests.\r\nReferencing EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73 (1973), for the importance of substantive review of classified materials.\r\nACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422 (D.C. Cir. 2013), which clarifies the limits of Glomar responses following public acknowledgment.\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nEnclosed is a Fee Waiver Request [attach Fee_Waiver_Letter.pdf], as the information sought is for public knowledge and understanding, and not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nResponse Expectations:\r\nA timely response within the 20-working-day statutory period as outlined in FOIA is expected. In the event of any denial or partial fulfillment, a detailed justification referencing specific FOIA exemptions is required.\r\n\r\nLegal Preparedness:\r\nThis request is structured for use in potential legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the FOIA. Inadequate response or non-compliance may result in legal action.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n\r\nFee_Waiver_Letter.pdf",
