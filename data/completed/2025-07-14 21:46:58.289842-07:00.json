I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. An installment of records responsive to your request has been uploaded to Box. The records consist of a 42-page document (RM-00001 thru RM-00042) and 0 (MB) of native data. You may inspect and/or download these records via this link: https://atg-wa.box.com/s/fd9ijxugnwko6ku4c7rtgrgh10x7h3ei . Please do so within 30 days. Records provided via Box are free of charge. You do not need a Box account to access the records. If a password is required to access the records, one will be provided to you in a separate email. We did not withhold or redact any information in these records. If you prefer to receive these records on CD, USB thumb drive, or paper, there is a charge. Please see the AGO Public Records Fee Schedule for cost information. If you prefer one of these formats, please submit a check or money order to my attention within 30 days, in the amount specified on the Fee Schedule, payable to the Office of the Attorney General, and send it to the address below. Once payment is received, the records will be mailed. Please be advised that if you do not either download these records, access them for inspection, or submit payment for an alternate format on or before August 13, 2025, the request is considered to have been fulfilled and is closed on that date for failure to claim or review records. This means that the Attorney General\u2019s Office will not further address the request, and that is the date from which the Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review starts to run. Please contact me within 30 days via email or at Office of the Attorney General, Public Records & Constituent Services, P.O. Box 40100, Olympia, WA 98504-0100, if you have any questions. Thank you.

I received your request forwarded to me on 7/10/2025 for:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Any and all lists, spreadsheets or other organized datasets that detail potential or substantiated allegations of misconduct and/or impeached or impeachable testimony, created under Brady v. Maryland and/or Giglio v.

Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States. During the current administration of District Attorney Barbara Romo, we have had one Giglio disclosure letter and case re: former Officer Robert Turney in our Cibola County District. Included here is a document fragment detailing the underlying case. The allegation of misconduct came from a discovery from the district court; therefore, we don\u2019t have specific additional records other than the attached letters to:\r\n\r\n  *   The letter the Sheriff of Cibola County asked our deputy to draft and send.\r\n  *   The spreadsheet detailing the cases for which we had to submit a disclosure letter.\r\n  *   A copy of the disclosure letter.( Each letter heading was corrected for each case otherwise the body of the letter was the same, the letter attached is a sample).\r\n  *   Letter to the Defense Counsel\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n//Melissa Howden//\r\n\r\n\r\nMelissa A.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

I would like to request that the Division provide the list of offenders on the SOR currently. \r\n\r\nIf that request is not possible, I wonder if the Division has: the exact number of people who are 1) on both the sex offender registry and probation; and 2) on both the sex offender registry and parole; as per the latest available data is requested.\r\n\r\nIf another agency has this data, I request the name of that agency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWendy Sawyer",

        "communication": "Dear Director at the Office of Information Policy, \r\n\r\nThis letter is in reference to FOIA Request #24-00644-F which you closed on March 25th 2024 after a lengthy response suggesting no responsive documents have met the plain letter language of my FOIA request. I believe this request was closed in error and am humbly appealing your judgement. \r\n\r\n1) In denying this request your office suggested that the request for correspondences was too broad. However, your response does not indicate that an actual search has occurred. In order to help your team limit your search I am rewriting this search to better help guide your search. I am also available for a call if you would like to discuss further refining this search. \r\n\r\n- Emails, letters, and text messages between the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and India\u2019s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) mentioning \"Operation Broader Sword\" between January 1st 2022 and the date this request is full-filled.\r\n\r\nI believe this request both specifies types of correspondences, the senders and receivers, and the specific date ranges for which you to search. Operation Broader Sword is a highly publicized operation. (See: https://in.usembassy.gov/u-s-and-india-cooperate-on-operation-broader-sword-to-stop-international-shipments-of-illegal-and-dangerous-drugs-medical-devices/). The DEA's involvement alongside the other agencies has also been highly publicized. (SEE: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/us-india-joint-operation-seizes-500-shipments-of-illicit-prescription-drugs-and-medical-devices/article67053528.ece). \r\n\r\nEmails, Text Messages, and Letters sent by public servants in their capacity as public servants are public records. Thus they are FOIA'ble. Retrieving already existing emails, text messages, or letters, is not requesting a new record be created. It is not tantamount to research. \r\n\r\n2) The seizure of 500 shipments of contraband has been highly publicized. (SEE: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/us-india-joint-operation-seizes-500-shipments-of-illicit-prescription-drugs-and-medical-devices/article67053528.ece). DEA rules mandate such records be kept for at least two years (SEE: https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/mtgs/researcher_train/conf_2019/feb_2019/barron.pdf). \r\n\r\nFor this reason, I believe there are in fact responsive documents to the following request:\r\n\r\nAny documents including but not limited to seizure records, arrest records, contracts, reports, intelligence briefings regarding \"Operation Broader Sword\" between January 1st 2022 and the date this request is full-filled.\r\n\r\nA reminder that I am a journalist and this information is being requested in the public interest to shed light on the cross-border illicit drug trade impacting US citizens. It is in the public's interest to know about the inflows of such material into the country and therefore I am requesting a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nLastly, the FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or to conduct research, analyze data, or answer questions when responding to requests. The retrieval of already existing documents is not research. It is the FOIA officers job to find responsive public documents to a request or provide specific statute exemptions for why a FOIA request hasn't been completed. This has not happened in this case. \r\n\r\nConsidering the myriad of media reports about this operation, I believe responsive documents do in fact exist. Please provide a timeline in which you can conduct a reasonable search for these documents. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time. I am available on the following phone number if you'd like to chat more +1 347 770 4163 / +1 347 775 7522.",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\n1. The specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\n\r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

You requested: \u201cKing County Sheriff's Office \r\nWashington Public Records Act Office \r\n516 3rd Avenue \r\nSeattle, WA 98104-2392 \r\nJanuary 13, 2025 \r\nJanuary 12, 2025 \r\nvia email to KCSOlegal@kingcounty.gov \r\nKing County Sheriff - JLARC (2024) Agency Costs Fulfilling Public Records Requests Including Litigation for the year 2024 \r\n\r\nTo whom it may concern, \r\nRCW 40.14.026(5) \r\n\u201cTo improve best practices for dissemination of public records, each agency with actual staff and legal costs associated with fulfilling public records requests of at least one hundred thousand dollars during the prior fiscal year must\u2026 report to the joint legislative audit and review committee by July 1st of each subsequent year the following metrics, measured over the preceding year: \r\nRCW 40.14.026(5)(l) \r\n(l) The estimated costs incurred by the agency in fulfilling records requests, including costs for staff compensation and legal review, and a measure of the average cost per request; \r\nRCW 40.14.026(5)(o) \r\n(o) The costs incurred by the agency with managing and retaining records, including staff compensation and purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests; \r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56 \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS \r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints. \r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\n\r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nGood Luck. \r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fking-county-sheriffs-office-2399%252Fking-county-sheriff-jlarc-2024-agency-costs-fulfilling-public-records-requests-including-litigation-for-the-year-2024-179629%252F%253Femail%253DKCSOlegal%252540kingcounty.gov&url_auth_token=AAATlkFknXebZY40DLJRN3WT-o4%3A1tXMN3%3AUwXr1fpq7PuOqdtdYBDOcUsm02jNLyGb5d7ngXDPuP8 \r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nWLYNMJMC \r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 179629-51818793@requests.muckrock.com \r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 179629 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Your request mentioned: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nHello, \r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of blank field interview cards or equivalent forms filled out during a police stop. Search 2018 to 2024, if there have been no changes since 2018 to the cards, then that year is sufficient. \r\n\r\nThank you \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoey Scott \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsanta-monica-police-department-371%252Ffield-interview-cards-santa-monica-police-department-185562%252F%253Femail%253DVirginia.Connolly%252540smgov.net&url_auth_token=AAAdKEUUTzoD2yyBeUP-jjU-owY%3A1u9amk%3AJIjCgJWgXxtnGToV4fy_XznItus73fryfo3zwOMMST4\" We have withheld records that contain sensitive intelligent and security procedure information because the public interest in non-disclosure exceeds the public interest in disclosure for the reasons discussed below. (Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.000.) The public interest must be weighed whether such disclosure \u201cwould contribute significantly to public understanding of government activities\u201d and serve the legislative purpose of \u2018\u2018shed[ding] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties.\u2019\u2019 ( City of San Jose v. Superior Court\u00a0(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1019.) Here, disclosure of this record would not significantly contribute to an understanding of the City\u2019s performance or duties. Moreover, the release of this information could result in the misuse of documents intended for sensitive public safety incidences.\u00a0 For these reasons, in weighing the public interest, the City finds that the public interest served by nondisclosure of these types of records outweighs the public interest served by disclosure. \r\nSincerely, \r\nDoberne #3797 \r\nPolice Records Supervisor \r\nSanta Monica Police Records",
