The child was taken to Scotland and the father had no contact for over 12 months. \r\n\r\nThis incident appears to have involved violations of federal law under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204 among other crimes.\r\n\r\nFee waiver requested under victim rights, public accountability standards, and exercise of civil rights.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
