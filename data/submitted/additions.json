        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThis letter is in response to an email received by this office requesting certain records pursuant to the \"Nebraska Public Records Act,\" (\"NPRA\") Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 84-712 through 84-712.09 (2014, Cum. Supp. 2022). The request is attached to this email for your convenience. For the following reason, the Agency is unable to fulfill this request.\r\n\r\nIn Nebraska, the basic rule for open public records is set out in Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712 (2014). That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \"all citizens of this state and all other persons interested in the examination of the public records\" shall have the right to examine records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memoranda and abstracts from those records, and to obtain copies of records in certain circumstances. The request we received for the records listed above came from MuckRock.com. It requires us to respond to MuckRock.com directly, i.e., either by email to MuckRock.com (preferred) or by U.S. Mail addressed to \"MuckRock News\" in Boston, Massachusetts. However, MuckRock is neither a Nebraska citizen nor an interested person and, as a result, we do not consider this third-party request to be valid under the statute referenced above.\r\n\r\nAlthough no records were withheld due to Muckrock.com's status being not a citizen of the State of Nebraska or an interested party under the NPRA, the Agency provides the following rights to appeal as a convenience:  If you believe the withholding of information requested is in error, you have the right, pursuant to Nebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 84-712.03, to appeal the decision by filing for relief by a writ of mandamus in the District Court in Lancaster County, Nebraska or to petition the Nebraska Attorney General for review of this denial. For the purpose of an appeal, Thomas Skutt is the State official responsible for the decision to deny any portion of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that public records law allows for a charge for the actual cost of collecting, reproducing, and mailing the records you have requested; however, there is no cost for this request.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nThomas Skutt, Jr., JD | Public Records and Discovery Attorney III\r\nLEGAL SERVICES\r\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services\r\nOFFICE: 402-471-7020   |   FAX: 402-742-2374\r\nDHHS.ne.gov<http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/default.aspx>  |  Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/NEDHHS/>  |  Twitter<https://twitter.com/NEDHHS>  |  LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/nebraska-department-of-health-and-human-services>\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message, including any attachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Skutt:\r\nI appeal the denial of my public records request (#181419-64797971) regarding physician health program records. Your denial based solely on MuckRock's non-Nebraska status warrants reconsideration for the following legal and policy reasons:\r\n\r\nLegal Precedent Against Residency Restrictions\r\nCourts have consistently ruled against residency-based restrictions on public records:\r\n\r\n\r\nMcBurney v. Young (2013): While the Supreme Court upheld Virginia's citizens-only FOIA law, it specifically noted this doesn't prevent access through other means or agents\r\nLee v. Minner (3d Cir. 2006): Struck down Delaware's citizens-only restriction as unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause\r\nLanphere & Urbaniak v. State of Colorado (10th Cir. 1994): Found that once records are publicly available, states cannot restrict access based on residency\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Interested Person\" Standard Under Nebraska Law\r\nNebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 84-712's inclusion of \"other persons interested\" demonstrates legislative intent broader than mere residency:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research serves compelling public interests in physician health and patient safety\r\nCross-state comparative analysis benefits Nebraska's healthcare system\r\nNational research on physician health programs directly impacts Nebraska medical practices\r\nThe information will inform evidence-based policy improvements\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications\r\nMultiple constitutional provisions support broad access:\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment protections for gathering information about government operations (Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 1980)\r\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause protection for cross-state research activities\r\nCommerce Clause restrictions on discriminating against out-of-state entities\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Policy and Research Impact\r\nDenying access would:\r\n\r\n\r\nHinder research comparing state approaches to physician health\r\nPrevent identification of best practices that could benefit Nebraska\r\nReduce accountability in programs affecting public safety\r\nCreate unnecessary barriers to academic research\r\n\r\n\r\nEstablished Research Purpose\r\nThis request is part of a comprehensive study of state physician health programs that:\r\n\r\n\r\nExamines varying approaches to physician mental health and substance use\r\nAnalyzes effectiveness of supportive versus punitive interventions\r\nWill produce recommendations for program improvements\r\nBenefits medical professionals and patients nationwide\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Considerations\r\nWhile I could arrange for a Nebraska resident to submit this request, such a workaround:\r\n\r\n\r\nWastes state and requester resources\r\nCreates artificial barriers to legitimate research\r\nContradicts principles of open government\r\nServes no compelling state interest\r\n\r\nI request that you:\r\n\r\nReconsider the denial based on these legal and policy arguments\r\nProcess my request as an \"interested person\" under the statute\r\nProvide a timeline for producing the requested records\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can provide additional documentation of the research purpose and public benefit. Thank you for your consideration.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDr. Vig Sinclair MD",
