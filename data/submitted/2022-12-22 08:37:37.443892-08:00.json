The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\n\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\n\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\n\n1. I request a complete electronic .pdf copy of all public documents filed with the King County Superior Clerk of the Court in case # 21-2-11739-9 SEA - IRWIN ET ANO VS CITY OF SEATTLE. The documents requested should be exact .pdf copies of the attached screenshot from the King County Superior Court Clerk\u2019s office (attached).\n\nDocuments requested include all court filings of all participants both plaintiff and defendant.\n\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\n\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST.\n\nPlease provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\n\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\n\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter.\nNo official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\n\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\n\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\n\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\n\nFEES\n\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\n\nEXEMPTION LOGS\n\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records, documents, and communications responsive to Operation Hermit. Operation Hermit was a black propaganda campaign conducted by the OSS in Nanking, China between roughly June and September 1945, and was led by OSS officer Seymour I. Nadler. The program was first identified publicly by one of its participants, Elizabeth MacDonald (aka Elizabeth McIntosh), in her 1947 book \"Undercover Girl\". Ms. MacDonald describes the program as radio broadcasts providing a \"daily forecast based on the pseudo-sciences of astrology, fortune telling, face reading, palmistry, phrenology, and numerology\" (pages 200-201). Mr. Nadler confirmed his participation as part of an interview in 1989 for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project Information Series, where he references Ms. MacDonald's \"Undercover Girl\" by name. A third participant, Gordon Auchincloss, confirmed his role in an American Public Media radio documentary, \"Battles of Belief in World War II\".\r\n\r\nMr. Nadler's statement can be found on page 2 of the linked PDF: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/mss/mfdip/2004/2004nad01/2004nad01.pdf\r\n\r\nMr. Auchincloss's statements can be found in the linked transcript: https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wwii/transcript.html\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of privacy. All of the subjects have disclosed their participation in Operation Hermit and spoken of their roles publicly, as shown above. Additionally, there is no expectation that this request will interfere with any ongoing operations, nor should it reveal any trade secrets. Operation Hermit occurred 77 years ago, and the OSS ceased all operations shortly thereafter. \r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Creem Magazine, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Your\r\nrequest concerns United States Naval Records.\r\n\r\nOur office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for NARA\u2019s operational records\r\n(records created by this agency).   Because your FOIA request is for\r\nrecords that may be archival records (records created by or originated in a\r\ndifferent agency but that may have been transferred to the legal custody of\r\nNARA), we are forwarding it by this email to our Office of Research\r\nServices, Textual Reference (RR2RR) staff who handle FOIA requests for\r\ntextual archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number and respond directly\r\nto you.

As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may\r\nexperience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.
