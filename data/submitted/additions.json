Every person mentioned in the report has long since died. The report seems to have mistakenly not redacted Georgy Malenkov's name in one section. This request asks to evaluate the application of the 25X1 exemption in regards to this document - especially if the original release had incorrectly or accidentally not redacted Malenkov's or other individual's names. \r\n\r\nThank you for the CIA's commitment to transparency and I look forward to working with you until this request is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
