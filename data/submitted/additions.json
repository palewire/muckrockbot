This request specifically seeks all communications between Johnson and other DOI political appointees as well as staffers in Burgum's office. This request seeks records produced since July 1, 2025. \r\n\r\nI am a reporter for Public Domain and seek a fee waiver. I will pay $25 if that waiver is denied.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias",
