Specifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nEmails sent or received between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, by any Legislator or their staff containing the phrase \"fair work week\" in the message text or attachments, excluding internal advisory communications. I request that the responsive records be provided in electronic format. \r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver because my research is in the public interest as judged by the National Science Foundation (award # 2203815). But if there are any fees associated with fulfilling this request, please provide an estimate of these costs before proceeding. If my request is unclear or too broad, I would appreciate your assistance in narrowing the scope.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response as soon as practicable or within five business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\r\nc/o MuckRock News\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\npeter.fugiel@rutgers.edu\r\n260-468-8528",

In\r\nshort, though: your request, as is, may qualify for a 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut it does not qualify for a fee waiver. To qualify for a fee waiver, the\r\nrequest, among other things, must be narrowly tailored to preserve public\r\nresources, which it is not as it seeks records from a two year period from\r\nroughly 90 offices. Speaking more frankly, I can also tell you that a\r\nsearch in our e-mail records collection tool of \u201cfair work week\u201d\r\nunfortunately won\u2019t only return hits with \u201cfair work week\u201d -- it will\r\nreturn anything with \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d or \u201cweek\u201d in it, which I\u2019m sure you\r\ncan imagine will create countless (likely many thousands of) records that\r\nare not responsive to your request and that will need to be sorted through\r\nbefore we can provide you with the records that are responsive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to read through the attached policy and can confirm that\r\nyour request meets all of the qualifications for a fee reduction, I can\r\nproceed with the request as is and will grant you the 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut would ask for your patience as this request will take months of work to\r\ncomplete. I am also happy to work with you to help you reconfigure your\r\nrequest to be more specific (for example, by narrowing the search window,\r\nor seeking records from fewer offices) so that we can grant that full fee\r\nwaiver. If we do proceed with a fee reduction only, I will make sure to\r\ncommunicate a fee estimate before we actually begin processing your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed once you\u2019ve had a chance\r\nto read through the attached policy document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Michael Burns *|* Legal and Public Records Assistant*\r\n\r\nOffice of the Legislative Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice: 503.986.1243\r\n\r\n[image: http://intranet/CapitolImages/Oregon%20State%20Seal%20-%20Color.jpg]\n",

I understand the need to weigh the public interest in the records\r\nrequested against the burden of retrieving and reviewing them.

I am surprised to learn that your\r\ncollection tool does not allow for compound search terms or operators (e.g.\r\nfair AND work AND week). One way of working around this limitation might be\r\nto narrow the keyword search to certain fields, e.g. the email subject or\r\nattachment file name. Another possibility would be to search for records\r\ncontaining relevant bill numbers (SB878, SB888) instead of common words.\r\nBut I'm not sure if you can search specific fields or metadata of these\r\nemails. I would appreciate any further information or assistance you could\r\nprovide in tailoring my request.\r\n\nAll the best,\r\nPeter",

        "communication": "Hi Peter,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad you asked, because it gave me an opportunity to check in with the team that pulls e-mails for us (our IT folks are the ones who pull the records, while we review, redact, and discuss/disseminate them with/to the various concerned parties.) What they told me is that compound search terms with operators do (read: should) work, and that if I am seeing results that contradict that we can investigate why. Since I frequently see evidence to the contrary, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to review with them the next time the issue comes up. It\u2019s quite possible that user error (i.e. using operators in lower case instead of all caps) yielded nonresponsive records in the past. Thankfully we do always find the correct records (assuming they exist)... we just tend to end up with a lot of separating the wheat from the chaff, which isn\u2019t practical for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe tool they use, by the way, is Office 365 eDiscovery. It doesn\u2019t allow you to limit what fields you\u2019re searching in, but if you\u2019re curious, this<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-keyword-queries-and-search-conditions?view=o365-worldwide> article discusses the ins-and-outs of how to use it.\r\n\r\nAs for your current request: really, I can limit it however you\u2019d like. The goal here is to make sure you are getting the records you want and are entitled to, so I\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re doing it right. I\u2019ll just need you to specify the conditions so I\u2019m not misinterpreting anything. We can use your original search terms, and can also add SB###, SB ###, Senate Bill ###, etc. to the list of terms. The search will find hits in both e-mails and attachments. The biggest issue remains the number of accounts you\u2019re asking us to pull records from, and the best advice I can offer is to limit your search to members of the Legislative Assembly and committees that actually worked on whichever bills you\u2019re interested in. You\u2019ll need to do the research on that if that\u2019s a route you\u2019d like to take, but OLIS<https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/previous-session-bills.aspx> is a great place to start.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll await further correspondence. Have a great day in the meantime.\r\n\r\nMichael\n",

That said, I hope you'll find what you are looking for here.\r\n\r\nThis completes our response to your request.\r\n\r\nRecords:\r\n\r\nRep Tina Kotek1<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/80ko4qt3v4ci30w6t72md/prr732-records-Rep.TinaKotek.pdf?rlkey=jz6svfio4xc9g1xktu4bpg1nw&st=qscj1iz4&dl=0>\r\nRep Tina Kotek2<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dd9r1y7mzdaq8ncparxgs/prr732-records-Christine.K-Tina-Kotek.pdf?rlkey=9vz2hfp1abzn8yise1vfdew46&st=ycdon0n3&dl=0>\r\nSen Kathleen Taylor<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ib4clyq7hulxnszisiyuo/prr732-records-Sen.KathleenTaylor.pdf?rlkey=uo6sxj7sr0bfx5k193k36nxfg&st=s4hx0fmz&dl=0>\r\nSen Michael Dembrow<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qjd5lz4wes336sbps97ib/prr732-records-Sen.MichaelDembrow.pdf?rlkey=rnceti4i3e5w6wxkiqdrlvtos&st=yycfxe72&dl=0>\r\nSen Peter Courtney<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xaijz72lu15h9kzr0t2mf/prr732-records-Sen.PeterCourtney.pdf?rlkey=74icw37h5302390fjksgcv7ln&st=szuxjzg2&dl=0>\r\nSen Tim Knopp<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/39yhf930unvsm7xl322a7/prr732-records-Sen.TimKnopp.pdf?rlkey=id2rglese6g0uvb4zj1zko8ls&st=hpwobykm&dl=0>\r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\nMichael Burns | Legal and Public Records Assistant\r\nOffice of the Legislative Counsel\r\nOffice: 503.986.1243\r\n[http://intranet/CapitolImages/Oregon%20State%20Seal%20-%20Color.jpg]\n",

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "08/12/2024 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuckRock News, DEPT MR136588 \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2024-ICAP-00127 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Appeal on remand. You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \n\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \n\nSincerely, \n\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist\n",

Get real.\r\nThat Josh Tetens was told by me in front of witnesses who heard me, and him at the Republican Club WITH Brittany Lannen, at that time she was waiting to sign a contract to represent the Crawleys and was AT the Republican Club with me and others rather upset at the entire situation. Tetens was given the opportunity to talk to her and he said he didn't need to because he believed her. \r\n\r\nThat I want and am forced to go to the Grand Jury Foreperson myself is a travesty in itself and you know it. \r\n\r\nTetens has had phone calls from other people who wanted to tell him what happened and he does not even call them back.\r\n\r\nI have emails and texts between myself and this DA and now I am satisfied that THIS is a travesty. I along with many, many others have been to the Federal authorities about this because YOU people simply don't care. However, you have law licenses and I have proof.\r\n\r\nI feel quite sure that you, Mr. Chapman would indeed rather have your head in the sand, it's oh, so much nicer, however, there is proof, witnesses and people who will not lie.\r\n\r\nThis has been going on since February the sixth and I, am quite tired of playing little games with you \"boys\" I have statements, texts, and on the other hand, your incompetence and total lack of \"curiosity\" about the matter. i suspect you talked to ole Par and he assured you I was crazy, well, let's see how this plays out. Remember you all KNOW about this so you're all culpable because of your knowledge and failure as officers of the court to do anything.\r\n\r\nLet's stop and think how my Complaint against not getting the name of the Grand Jury Foreperson along with this story plus evidence is going to play at the AG's office, then they too will  have the knowledge of a crime .....\r\n\r\nYour DA won't take this to the Grand Jury or even return calls from people who were there. The taxpayers paid 150K for this, Crawley himself is willing to tell any of you that call him and yet you don't. He told ME. \r\n\r\nSo you non curious good old boys just transfer what needs to go to what department and play your game. \r\nI have evidence and truth on my side.\r\nLet's play.\r\nI have 60K read me every day which equates to 47% of the voting public and that was BEFORE Parnell and Charlotte and the County yellow tape at the old mansion debaucle.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with you?\r\nTruly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It appears to have an identifier of \u201c169830.\u201d  I have sent the request to the SO and to HR.\r\n\r\nSubject: None\r\nNone\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\nSilly me I asked for the Questionnaires, I thought any idiot would realize I wanted the ANSWERS to the questionnaires, but you thought you'd be cute and redact the answers. Hope buying yourself three weeks was worth it. Also, you know I don't drive so it would be nice if you'd do the answers in the NORMAL WAY and not put them on a thumb drive so you can have me trot on down there and you can see who brought me. That's what this is, isn't it? Inconvenience and a few giggles, well, send me the answers to the questionnaires, and the other stuff you neglected to ad. Keep thinking everyone is stupid. Go ahead it's served you well so far, right?\r\nDustin, dear, you can go ahead and write me another little bitch out note about how this has nothing to do with Felton but we both know that at this point, it does. Plus, YOU are still an officer of the court. Tick tock.\r\nWe request all responsive ANSWERS from the employees and any further correspondence from any supervisor to any employee or from supervisor to supervisor to the questionnaire's that we received in open records. We request all documentation that accompanied these questions and their answers and further request and disciplinary measures that generated from any questionnaires that have been handed out by ANY supervisor in the past 13 months.\r\nAll letters of explanation from Aaron Burns, James Wolfe, Brad Stovall, Tim Davenport, Martin Arellano, Rose Peterson, Dustin Losak, Pete Peterson, Hunter Herring, Parnell McNamara, Jeremy Bost, Cody Blossman, Mike Gates, Colt Braziel, All Jail Sgt's. Any questionnaires that any of the employees have answered in the past 13 months, any letters\r\nWe also request any and all disciplinary actions that have been issued since Cody Blossman has been Chief Deputy or in the past 13 months. We would like to include all disciplinary records that are being kept in supervisors desk and not placed in the personnel files as these are government documents and we are requesting them. The fact that these disciplinary records may be being kept in a desk or file does not exempt them from being subject to open records as all disciplinary measures are open to the public to view.\r\nWe request the names of all employees who have resigned or been terminated from the McLennan County Sheriffs Office since Cody Blossman has been chief deputy or in the past 13 months.\r\nWe further request any and all emails and correspondence between Cody Blossman and Anna Picasso for the past 13 months.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\nSincerely,\r\nBernadette Feazell\n",

With regard to agencies that have submitted probe photos, please provide logs, lists or datasets describing, as available, the requesting organization, the number of requests made, the dates of the requests, and the number of requests granted.  If the Commission maintains this information in an Excel spreadsheet, I request that the record be produced in this format.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the U.S. Coast Guard personnel records (OMPF) for a former servicemember named TRACY LAUREN MARROW (DATE OF BIRTH: 03/16/1958). Mr. Marrow was born in Newark, New Jersey. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1977 to 1979 and achieved the rank of petty officer, second class. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Marrow, known popularly as the rapper Ice-T, should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Marrow\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

After his comment, the Village of Niles Board President George Alpogianis responded:\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I know I don't respond to things, but I will respond to this. When we start taking care of our veterans first and getting them out of their tents. All the homeless veterans that we have damn right we'll help anybody. We've got to help our own people first \u2026 our veterans. Thank you. \u201c[3]\r\n\r\nThe board went on to approve this ordinance with no discussion or further comment.[4]\r\n\r\nTo that effect we are seeking emails from village of Niles email addresses between November 1, 2023 and the date this request is processed (inclusive of those dates) that include any of the following keywords in the subject line and/or body:\r\n\r\n\u2013 \"migrant\"\r\n\u2013 \"asylum\"\r\n\u2013 \"immigrant\"\r\n\u2013 \"refugee\"\r\n\u2013 \"unscheduled bus stop\"\r\n\r\nPlease include any email attachments.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. We would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "08/08/2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREFER TO:  279279 \n\nMs. Rebecca Renner \n\nEmail: 94187-19210523@requests.muckrock.com \n\nDear Ms. Renner: \n\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act request dated 6/3/2020, and received by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on the same date, in which you requested records concerning Black Lives Matter Protests in the US May and June 2020. Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 279279.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 13 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\n(b)(6)/(b)(7)(C) \nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), 13 pages have been released with 12 pages in part. Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld \n\nWe are withholding third party information, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6). To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). \nWe are withholding specific law enforcement codes, techniques, and procedures used in our investigation pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(E) exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records or information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). The information withheld reveals various law enforcement file numbers and codes which are primarily used to store and retrieve law enforcement information. The information withheld also reveals specific law enforcement procedures and techniques used in this investigation. Disclosure of this information could enable individuals outside of the agency to circumvent agency functions and gain access to sensitive investigative information. Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d \n\nSincerely, \n\nHirsh D. Kravitz \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division",

The number of search terms used and general nature of the search terms used (e.g., Heritage Foundation, EIN) is pulling in a lot of general and non-responsive information (examples attached).  For example, the term \u201cEIN\u201d which is presumably being used as an acronym for \u201cElection Integrity Network\u201d is hitting on the false positive \u201cEIN#\u201d or employee identification number (see page 4 of the attachment).

Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Section 7(1)(f) exempts from release \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)].

Mr. Bridges was born in Los Angeles, California. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1967 to 1975 and achieved the rank of petty officer second class. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Bridges, an Academy Award-winning film actor , should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Bridges Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Mint:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

In a letter dated June 2, 2017, the DOD informed the FAA that DOD flight data constitutes DOD Critical Infrastructure Information (DCRIT) and is therefore exempt from disclosure in accordance with this statute\u201d signed by Virginia Boyle Vice President, System Operations Services Air Traffic Organization and emailed by Angella Martin-Osorio.\r\n\r\nSome alleged laws have been included regarding the redacted information:\r\n1.  Section 242 of Title 18 \r\n2.  Privacy Act of 1974 \r\n3.  The Posse Comitatus Act\r\n4.  The Insurrection Act of 1807 \r\n5.  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1113\r\n6.  Redacted information does not coincide with the 16 different critical infrastructures\r\n7.  Additional information about laws and regulations have been provided via the attached appeal document.",

Therefore, it is not a current practice to collect and retain Qualified Contracts. To the best of our knowledge, before this requirement in the QAP, three requests for Qualified Contracts were made, and one request was pursued by the owner. Based on CHFA\u2019s record retention policy, that document is no longer on file with CHFA.\r\n\r\nThe list you requested is not an existing document, however, attached is the recorded termination agreement of the Land Use Restrictive Agreement (LURA) of the one development that pursued a Qualified Contract.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, please reach out to Matt Lynn, CHFA\u2019s media liaison, for any further assistance.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Schumacher\r\nStaff Attorney\r\nLegal and Risk Management\r\nColorado Housing and Finance Authority\r\n1981 Blake Street\r\nDenver, CO 80202\r\nwww.chfainfo.com<http://www.chfainfo.com/>\r\n303.297.7471 direct\r\n303.297.2432 main\r\n800.877.2432 toll free\r\n\r\nfinancing the places where people live and work\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clover Park School District received your public records request on November 5, 2021. Your request seeks all public records requests received by the District from January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021, as well as a complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s responses to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests since 2010 have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question, and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.     Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2.     Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3.     Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4.     The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the district, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing the first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by February 4, 2022. I have also submitted your request to our NextRequest Program on November 5, 2021, at 3:29 pm. This will also include our 5-day response from our District.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAranka Holmes\r\n\r\nCoordinator for Public Records, WC Claims, and ADA\r\n\r\n[cid:b525986e-eb5d-4ccc-9e3e-be0e3be9d7ee]\r\n\r\nCreating Promising Futures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Services Center\r\n\r\n10903 Gravelly Lake Dr SW, Lakewood WA  98499-1341\r\n\r\n253-583-5083 \u2022  Fax 253-583-5088\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail message and all attachments, if any, may contain confidential and privileged material and are intended only for the person or entity to which the message is addressed.

Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe District would like you to clarify whether you are seeking those requests for records which would qualify as FERPA requests, or if you are purely seeking the records produced under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records.\u00a0See\u00a034 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the second installment of records. The information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.
