According to a document released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Ronin 3.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Ronin 3,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

According to documents released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production in 2022. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\n\r\nGoverns public access to federal agency records and requires \"reasonable searches\" for responsive documents.\r\nFederal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101)\r\n\r\nMandates proper creation, maintenance, and preservation of federal records.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nNARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004)\r\n\r\nAgencies bear the burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their search and providing a justification for withholding records.\r\nChurch of Scientology v. IRS, 792 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\r\n\r\nAgencies must conduct a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989)\r\n\r\nDefines public interest in government transparency and accountability as fundamental to FOIA.\r\nWolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\r\n\r\nCourts review whether an agency\u2019s FOIA search was conducted in good faith and was adequate in scope.\r\nKissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980)\r\n\r\nClarifies agency obligations under FOIA regarding the handling and preservation of federal records.\r\n2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132)\r\n\r\nProhibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in accessing public services.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nRequires federally funded programs to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\r\n\r\nEstablishes effective communication requirements for public entities under the ADA.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v. Regional School Unit 26, 928 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2019)\r\n\r\nPublic entities must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure effective communication.\r\nHale v. King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004)\r\n\r\nAgencies bear the burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their search and providing a justification for withholding records.\r\nChurch of Scientology v. IRS, 792 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\r\n\r\nAgencies must conduct a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989)\r\n\r\nDefines public interest in government transparency and accountability as fundamental to FOIA.\r\nWolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\r\n\r\nCourts review whether an agency\u2019s FOIA search was conducted in good faith and was adequate in scope.\r\nKissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980)\r\n\r\nClarifies agency obligations under FOIA regarding the handling and preservation of federal records.\r\n2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132)\r\n\r\nProhibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in accessing public services.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nRequires federally funded programs to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\r\n\r\nEstablishes effective communication requirements for public entities under the ADA.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v. Regional School Unit 26, 928 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2019)\r\n\r\nPublic entities must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure effective communication.\r\nHale v. King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.
