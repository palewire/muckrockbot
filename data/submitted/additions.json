(\"GP)\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a04-101-4-601, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nGrantee Quarterly Operation Reports for Q3, 2022 and Q4, 2022 for the DC Fast Chargers funded under the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (EVIP), the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Program (AFIP) and any other programs for DC Fast Chargers funded by MEA that have Grantee Quarterly Operation Reports.\r\n\r\nIf all or any part of this request is denied, I request that I be provided with a written explanation that includes the reason for the denial, the legal authority justifying the denial, and my appeal rights. If you determine that some portions of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, please provide me with the portions that can be disclosed.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. In the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available.\r\n\r\nUnder GP \u00a7 4-203(b)(1), if a custodian determines that a record is responsive to a request and open to inspection, the custodian must produce the record \u201cimmediately\u201d after receipt of the written request. An additional reasonable period \u201cnot to exceed 30 days\u201d is available only where the additional period of time is required to retrieve the records and assess their status under the PIA. A custodian should not, however, wait the full 30 days to allow or deny access to a record if that amount of time is not needed to respond.\r\n\r\nIf access is to be granted, the record should be produced for inspection and copying promptly after the written request is evaluated. If it will take more than 10 working days to produce the requested records, the custodian must notify the requester, in writing or by email, of that fact. GP \u00a7 4-203(b)(2). The notification must be sent within the same 10-working-day time period and must indicate the amount of time needed to respond, the reason for the delay, and an estimate of the range of fees that may be charged.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within the time period prescribed in the statute.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLanny Hartmann",
