G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKayla Fox\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nfox.kayl@northeastern.edu\r\n(312) 718-0331\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This request applies to records from January 1, 2024, to the present (February 2, 2025).\r\n\t1.\tLGBTQ Health Data and Archived Reports:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all datasets, reports, studies, and statistical analyses related to LGBTQ health, including but not limited to diabetes, HIV/AIDS, mental health, and chronic conditions.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny prior versions of datasets, surveys, or research that contained LGBTQ-specific data before they were altered or removed from the CDC\u2019s website or databases.\r\n\t2.\tRecords of Data Removal or Suppression:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal communications, emails, memos, and directives regarding the decision to remove, modify, or restrict public access to LGBTQ health data.\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of website archives and database records that previously contained LGBTQ-related health statistics, including those removed after Executive Order 14168 took effect.\r\n\t\u2022\tDocumentation of any restrictions placed on CDC employees or researchers regarding the collection, publication, or discussion of LGBTQ health data.\r\n\t3.\tInternal Communications and Metadata:\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, text messages, and memoranda sent or received by CDC officials, administrators, and staff regarding LGBTQ health data removal or modifications.\r\n\t\u2022\tMetadata for all emails and communications related to LGBTQ health data suppression, including sender, recipient, timestamps, subject lines, and attachments.\r\n\t4.\tLegal and Policy Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications between the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the White House, or other federal agencies regarding compliance with Executive Order 14168.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny legal assessments, policy discussions, or memoranda analyzing the legality of removing LGBTQ health data from public access.\r\n\t5.\tDeleted or Missing Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tDocumentation regarding any deleted or missing records related to LGBTQ health data, including explanations for why they were removed.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny efforts made to recover or archive such data for future public release.\r\n\r\nLegal Prohibition on Data Destruction\r\n\r\nThe destruction of federal records, including datasets and internal communications, is prohibited under multiple federal laws and court rulings, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tFederal Records Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 31) \u2013 Mandates that agencies must preserve records documenting public policy decisions, and it is illegal to destroy records without authorization from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\r\n\t\u2022\tPresidential Records Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 22) \u2013 Requires that any records related to executive branch policies must be preserved, particularly those affecting public policy.\r\n\t\u2022\tArmstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993) \u2013 Established that federal agencies cannot delete or remove government records without following proper legal procedures and obtaining approval from NARA.\r\n\t\u2022\tJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012) \u2013 Affirmed that metadata is part of a government record and must be preserved and disclosed under FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf any LGBTQ-related datasets, reports, or web pages have been removed or destroyed, I request records identifying the personnel responsible, the legal justification, and any efforts to recover or archive the missing data.\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request is made in the public interest to assess how the CDC and the federal government are handling LGBTQ health data following Executive Order 14168. The suppression of health statistics, research, and policy discussions directly affects public health initiatives, medical research, and federal funding. Ensuring that LGBTQ health data remains available is essential for transparency, accountability, and public trust in federal health policy.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), as disclosure of these records will significantly contribute to public understanding of federal health policies and data integrity.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Under Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), FOIA fee waivers should be granted when a request serves the public interest by increasing transparency in government decision-making.\r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because this request concerns an urgent matter of public health and government transparency. The removal of LGBTQ health data could have immediate consequences for medical research, public policy, and federal funding allocations. The timely release of these records is critical for ongoing reporting and public awareness.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format (e.g., PDF, CSV, or JSON) where possible. As required by FOIA, I anticipate a response within 20 business days. If any part of this request requires clarification, I am available at Jordan@Lassiter.eu to discuss the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to Russia scholar Suzanne Massie. Massie's (born: 01/08/31 - died: 01/26/25) death was widely reported in the media. Massie was a close advisor to President Reagan and Reagan's use of the phrase, \"Trust, but verify\" is attributed to Massie's influence on Reagan's thinking. Massie's frequent visits to the White House in the 1980s were likely preceded by a formal background check by the bureau. \r\n\r\nThis request is for records about Suzanne Massie from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Suzanne Massie held by the Portland, Maine and New York City field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Suzanne Massie.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Suzanne Massie. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for any correspondence either to or from directors William Webster, William Sessions, Louis Freeh, Robert Mueller, James Comey, or Christopher Wray, where Suzanne Massie is mentioned. Of speciall interest is correspondence regarding Massie's closeness to, and influence on, Reagan; or commentary regarding Putin's public awarding of Russian citizenship and a passport to Massie in 2021. \r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with the bureau until this request is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(c).\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros \r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(c).\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros \r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(c).\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros \r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(c).\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros \r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
