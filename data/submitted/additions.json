As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful.
