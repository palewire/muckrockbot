Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status (e.g., classified or unclassified), and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records responsive to Dr. Leon Festinger (May 8, 1919 - February 11, 1989). Dr. Festinger was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1945-1947), the University of Michigan (1948-1951), the University of Minnesota (1951-1955), Stanford University (1955-1968), and The New School (1968-1989). While working for these institutions, he conducted research in the area of social psychology, famously developing the concept of cognitive dissonance in the books \"When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World\", published in 1956, and \"A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance\", published the following year.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Festinger's privacy, as he passed away in 1989. I have attached a reproduction of Dr. Festinger's obituary, published in The New York Times on February 12, 1989.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

The report focused on Recruitment and Retention issues at the Chester Fire Department and may cover other areas of concern as well. The primary concerns arose from resignations of 10 Chester Fire Department members in a period of several months resulting in a significant reduction of staff that has not been offset through recruitment. The report, accepted by the Board of Selectmen and provided to and discussed with Fire Chief Gladu, is requested. Comments during public session of the 9/22/2022 Board of Selectmen meeting confirm the MRI report was discussed in non-public session on 9/22/2022 with Fire Chief Gladu present. \r\n\r\nThe contracts, invoices, bills, quotes, and records of any money paid to MRI related to the commissioning of this report are requested. The identification of anytime representatives from MRI appeared before the Board of Selectmen. The identification of all instances this MRI report was discussed in non-public session and the reason pursuant to RSA 91-A:3 II used to justify entering non-public session, the minutes of the non-public session if the minutes are subject to public disclosure, and if the minutes are not subject to public disclosure the reason pursuant to RSA 91-A:3 III for withholding the minutes from public disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe MRI report of the Chester Fire Department is a government record subject to disclosure, in its entirety, under the New Hampshire Right to Know Law (RSA 91-A). The release of the complete report is of substantial public interest and necessary for the public to evaluate the effectiveness, preparedness and safe operation of the taxpayer funded Fire Department. For any redactions made please note the exemption reason relied upon for each redaction. \r\n\r\nEMAILS\r\nAll emails meeting the criteria below:\r\nSent or received by ANY of the following individuals: Fire Chief Gladu, Lieutenant Alex Hodosi, Station Manager Ingalls, Town Administrator Doda;\r\nIncluding ANY of the following search terms in the subject, body, or attachments: \"MRI\", \"Municipal Resources\", \"Recruitment\", \"Retention\", \"BOS\", \"Selectmen\";\r\nBetween the dates: May 1, 2022 and December 1, 2022.\r\nThe entire email thread, including attachments, is requested for each match of the criteria above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin J Dolan",

The contracts, invoices, bills, quotes, and records of payments made to MRI for the referenced report will be available on or before 12/16/2022 as time is needed to compile this portion of your request.\r\nRegarding the email search criteria, your request as written is too broad and needs to be more specific as searching multiple email accounts for \"BOS\" or \"Selectmen\" will return thousands of emails.
