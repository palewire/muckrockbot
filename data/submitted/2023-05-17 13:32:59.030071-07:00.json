NYPD, 959 F.3d 546 (2d Cir. 2020): In this federal appellate court case, the court recognized the public's right to access information concerning government surveillance programs and found that vague claims of interference with government operations were insufficient to withhold requested documents.\r\nCarpenter v. United States, 138 S.

The request was for \"Training Records and Courses Offered for the Computer Crime Unit (2022-2023)\".\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request, and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\nA determination as to whether your request is granted or denied will be reached on or before July 21, 2023, or we will notify you in writing if the responsible program area(s) should require additional time to locate, assemble and review documents that may be responsive to your request.\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.  When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: **\r\nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through Open FOIL.

Pursuant to the New York State Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law, Article 6, Sections 84-90), it is my esteemed honor to request access to and copies of any and all documents providing aggregated reports at a school district level concerning the information requested in the Online School Assessment Survey (OSAS) for the 2018-19 academic year, as referenced in the correspondence sent by Dr. Elizabeth Rausch-Phung in September 2018.\r\n\r\nThe materials I kindly request should include, but not be limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Aggregated immunization data for all students in grades pre-kindergarten through 12 at the school district level.\r\n2. Compliance rates for each school district.\r\n3. Any available documentation or correspondence related to schools that failed to complete and submit the survey by the December 15, 2018 deadline.\r\n\r\nIn the event that any portion of this request is denied, I respectfully request an explanation for the denial, including the specific exemption(s) under the Freedom of Information Law that you believe warrant refusal. If certain records are exempt from disclosure, kindly provide access to any reasonably segregable portion of the record.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, I would be most grateful if you could provide me with the remainder of the records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please use the following unique FOIA tracking number CBP-FO-2023-083504 to track the status of your request.  If you have not already done so, you must create a SecureRelease account. This is the only method available to check the status of your pending FOIA request.Provisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you.

Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c).   CBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.  We truly appreciate your continued patience.

See https://twitter.com/aurabogado/status/1657018774791520258?s=61&t=8Zqgr1Sh-7zb12EH9VIRJQ. Hours later, the public learned of another children\u2019s death in March 2023. See https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unaccompanied-migrant-child-died-angel-eduardo-maradiaga-espinoza-us-custody-florida/. HHS referred the public to its standards in a statement aimed at explaining the services children receive. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe ORR Unaccompanied Children Program Policy Guide is a summary of ORR policies for the placement, release and care of unaccompanied children in ORR custody. The guide is for members of the public and other stakeholders[.]\u201d See https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-introduction. Section 3.3.16 of the ORR Program Policy Guide sets forth a set of mandatory actions when a child in ORR custody. See https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-3. \r\n\r\nThis policy requires the up to 12 separate notifications in the event of a child\u2019s death: \r\n\r\nA. Reporting to Local Authorities and ORR - The care provider must immediately report the death to:\r\n(1) Local law enforcement, as appropriate;\r\n(2) The care provider\u2019s State or local licensing authority;\r\n(3) Child Protective Services, as applicable; and\r\n(4) ORR via a Significant Incident Report.\r\n\r\nB. Notification and Reporting within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n(5) ORR must immediately notify the appropriate staff in ORR, ACF and HHS.\r\n\r\nC. Notifications to External Parties \r\nORR must notify the following parties within 24 hours of a child\u2019s death: \r\n(6) The unaccompanied alien child\u2019s parent, legal guardian, or next-of-kin;\r\n(7) The unaccompanied alien child\u2019s attorney of record or the care provider\u2019s local legal service provider;\r\n(8) The applicable consulate;\r\n(9) The child advocate, if applicable;\r\n(10) Congressional officials\r\n(11) The local U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Field Office Juvenile Coordinator (FOJC); and\r\n(12) The Department of Homeland Security, ICE, Enforcement and Removal Operations, Juvenile and Family Residential Management Unit (ERO/JFRMU).\r\n\r\nDescription of Records Requested\r\nRequested Records Set #1. \r\nPlease provide any of the 12 notifications itemized above based on ORR policy that occurred in each of the two publicly reported deaths of children in ORR custody during 2023. \r\nRequested Records Set #2. \r\nPlease provide any other notifications of deaths in ORR custody that were made after the current ORR Policy 3.3.16 went into effect on July 22, 2019. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
