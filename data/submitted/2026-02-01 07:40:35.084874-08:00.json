Bush Administration regarding the Domain Name System (DNS) vulnerability discovered by security researcher Dan Kaminsky in 2008.\r\n\r\nFor guidance: http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html The Kaminsky bug has been described as a \"9/11\" level issue in the internet's architecture. \r\n\r\nScope of Search (Electronic Records): I specifically request that a search for responsive electronic communications be conducted across the following email domains and systems:\r\n\r\n@who.eop.gov (White House Office)\r\n@nsc.eop.gov (National Security Council)\r\n@ovp.eop.gov (Office of the Vice President)\r\n@gwb43.com (RNC-hosted domain utilized by Bush Administration staff)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nBriefing Materials & Memos: All briefing papers, memoranda, audio recordings, video recordings, and slide presentations prepared for the National Security Council (NSC), the Homeland Security Council (HSC), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) between July 1, 2008, and January 20, 2009, regarding the technical nature of the DNS vulnerability and its potential impact on critical infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAgency Correspondence: Communications between the White House and the Department of Commerce (NTIA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS/US-CERT), and the National Security Agency (NSA) regarding the coordinated secret patching effort prior to the public disclosure in August 2008.\r\n\r\nNational Security Impact Assessments: Records discussing the vulnerability's implications for the Root Zone of the DNS and the government's decision to initiate a formal \"Notice of Inquiry\" in October 2008 regarding the signing of the Root Zone.\r\n\r\nMeeting Minutes: Records of any meetings involving the Cybersecurity and Communications Reliability Board or the President\u2019s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) where Dan Kaminsky\u2019s research was discussed.\r\n\r\nIndividual Search Parameters: Please prioritize a search of the email records and digital files of the following individuals, regardless of the domain suffix used:\r\n\r\nMelissa Hathaway (Senior Director for Cyberspace) \r\nRobert Knake (National Security Council staff)\r\nPaul Kurtz (Homeland Security Council)\r\nJack Vaughn (Director for Cybersecurity Policy)\r\n\r\nPetitioner Status: I am a researcher and this request is made for non-commercial, historical purposes. The disclosure of this information is in the public interest as it provides transparency regarding the federal government's role in securing the internet's core architecture.\r\n\r\nIf certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the George W.

These contracts were signed on 12/7/2023 and 12/9/2024 by city employees. I have reason to believe these records should exist because according to Article VI of the Joplin Home Rule Charter, the City Attorney is required to approve of the form of all contracts. The charter indicates this approval should be marked on the contract, but since it is not I must assume the record exists elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn addition I am requesting the terms and conditions the City of Joplin agreed to in the contract dated 12/9/2024.  These terms are hosted online and are changed by Flock at will and without notice.  The current terms online are not the same terms agreed to by The City.  Archiving of the terms by archive.org is also not possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Dillon Bergin: In accordance with K.S.A. 45-218 (d), we have begun the process of determining if we possess any public records meeting the terms of your request and how best to proceed. Soon we will provide you with one or more of the following:  \r\n  *  Copies of the requested public records. \r\n  *  A statement concerning our inability to locate any public records meeting the terms of your request. \r\n  *  A request for additional clarification concerning the types of records or information you are seeking. Record requests that can be provided with less than one hour of staff time will not be billed for labor. If we determine that our office possesses the public records you request, but are voluminous, difficult to locate, and/or contain information that may include open and closed information, we will provide you with a written estimate of the fees that we will require be pre-paid in order to pay for the actual costs associated with (a) locating and/or retrieving the public records from storage, (b) staff time spent in assisting with making copies of the records, including staff time spent examining the records for possible closure and/or redaction, and (c) copying and mailing the requested public records. In addition to billing for labor that exceed one hour of staff time, the following rates shall apply: \r\n \r\n Copies, 25 cents per page after 100 pages \r\n Staff time will be charged at the rate of pay for each person whose time is used in order to assist and/or respond to a specific request. This may include the time spent to access records maintained on computer facilities, review records to determine whether closure exceptions apply and /or to redact open from closed information. For the purpose of transparency, our rates are as follows: general staff time will be charged at $20 per hour, and information technology (IT) services and Legal staff services will be charged at $38 per hour. \r\n Additional fees may be assessed if any other costs are incurred by KDOC in connection with complying with a record request. KDOC will provide an estimate of the fees which shall be paid prior to the department gathering the records. In order to ensure payment, the final cost of providing access to or furnishing copies must be paid before the records are provided. If the final cost is less than the estimate, the requestor will be reimbursed for the difference. 5. If we determine that we do possess the records, but that the records are subject to closure by law, we will provide you with that information with a written citation to the laws allowing or requiring that type of public record to be closed.",
