You may choose to pick up your copies, or I will mail or fax them to you. If you want me to send you the copies, you will need to provide me with an address or fax number. I will provide electronic copies (such as email or CD-ROM) upon request if we keep the data in electronic format. \r\n The City of Brooklyn Park charges members of the public for copies of government data. These charges are authorized under Minnesota Statutes, section 13.03, subdivision 3(c). \r\n You must pay for the copies before I will give them to you. \r\n For less than 100 copies of black and white, letter or legal size paper you will be charged 25\u00a2 for a one-sided copy, or 50\u00a2 for a two-sided copy. \r\n The charge for most other types of copies, when a charge is not set by statute or rule, is the actual cost of searching for and retrieving the data, and making the copies or electronically transmitting the data (i.e., send the data by email) \r\n In determining the actual costs of making copies, we factor in employee time, the cost of the materials onto which we are copying the data (paper, CD, DVD, etc.) and mailing costs (if any) \r\n The cost of employee time to search the data, retrieve data, and make copies is $21.10 per hour. \r\n If, based on your request, we find it necessary for a higher-paid employee to search for and retrieve the data, we will calculate search and retrieval charges at the higher salary/wage. \r\n The Data Practices Act does not require us to create or collect new data in response to a data request if we do not already have the data, or to provide data in a specific form or arrangement if we do not keep the data in that form or arrangement. (For example, if the data you request are on paper only, we are not required to create electronic documents to respond to your request.) \r\n If we agree to create data in response to your request, we will work with you on the details of your request, including costs and response time. \r\n Devin Montero, CMC \r\n Compliance Official \r\n 763-493-8180 \r\n Original Request: \r\n Name: bocar ba \r\n Email: 178885-38541326@requests.muckrock.com \r\n Address: MuckRock News, DEPT MR178885, 263 Huntington Ave \r\n City: Boston \r\n State: Massachusetts \r\n Zip: 02115 \r\n Phone: 6172991832 \r\n Delivery Method: Electronic \r\n Description: To Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, I hereby request the following records: Salary information for all employees of the City of Brooklyn Park for dates January 2021 to today (or most recent date that data is collected).

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Burns, \r\n  \r\n Per Anchorage Municipal Code 3.90.050A., \"A fee [for public records production] may be required. The fee shall not exceed the actual cost to the agency. If the person is unable to pay any requested fee, and signs an affidavit to the effect he is indigent, there will be no cost to such person ().\" \r\n  \r\n Per Anchorage Municipal Code of Regulations 3.90.005, in addition to the fee for copying a record, a municipal agency may charge a fee for employee time to search for, retrieve and redact as necessary, the record at a rate not exceeding $40.00 per hour. \r\n  \r\n The estimated fee for your public records request is $60. An invoice is enclosed for your review. Although this estimate includes employee time it will take to complete this task, employees must fit this into all other municipal work. \r\n  \r\n Please respond with your decision to pursue the fulfillment of your request and make payment within 30 days. Failure to respond within 30 days will result in the closing of the public record request. Any amendments made to your original record request (description) will not be processed. Instead, please submit a new request. \r\n  \r\n Payment by mail, or in-person\r\nThe Municipal Attorney's Office accepts payment by check, money order, or cash. Checks or money order should be made out to \"Municipal Attorney's Office,\" and please put \"PRR 2024-471\" in the subject/memo. The necessary course of action will begin once payment has been successfully received and processed. \r\n  \r\n If additional time is needed, a communication shall be sent to inform you of the necessary changes affecting the time and/or cost to the agency in order to reach completion status. In your request, you say \"provide the respondent records within 10 days as required by statute.\" You may be referencing 2 AAC 96.325(a) but this does not apply to municipalities (see 2 AAC 96.600 and AS 40.25.123). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Please note, upon payment, you may receive all, partial, or no copies of the record(s). It is through our search process, which begins only after payment has been successfully received and processed, that we may identify exemptions as listed in AMC 3.90.040 or as otherwise set forth in law. \r\n  \r\n If you have any additional questions concerning the contents of this letter or what is being asked of you, please contact the Municipal Attorney's Office via here. \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n Municipality of Anchorage \r\n 632 West 6th Avenue, Suite 730\r\nAnchorage, Alaska 99501 \r\n 907-343-4545 \r\n _________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFailure to receive your response within 30 days will result in the closure of this request.",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records.\u00a0Please note that the number included is for transportation requests submitted in Aspen, not the number of White Forms submitted as the District does not centrally house or track the White Forms. Also, be advised that some schools use \u201cwhite forms\u201d differently as transportation terminology may differ from school to school. \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends. RESPONSE: 186. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. \r\nThank you for your request.

These records \r\nshould include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. RESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The District has reproduced your request below for reference:\r\n\r\nPlease provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted (sic) fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nBased upon the foregoing request, the district hereby encloses the documents responsive to your request subject to public disclosure. Please note the district has not typically met the threshold for reporting to JLARC. The district also did not collect fees for records requests in 2024. The district believes the records provided are fully responsive to your request as the district has interpreted it. Therefore, the district now considers your request to be fully satisfied and closed as of today\u2019s date without any further action. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.550, any judicial review of the district\u2019s actions taken or challenged must be filed within one year of today\u2019s date January 17, 2025.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that to the extent that the District inadvertently produces any privileged document(s) that are encompassed by an exemption under the PRA, or any applicable state or federal law, such production is not intended to be a waiver of any privilege or any right to withhold such documents or documents of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or need to clarify your request(s), please do not hesitate to contact me public.records@rentonschools.us<mailto:public.records@rentonschools.us> so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPublic Records",

Any and all such lists, full or partial, would be appreciated and may include, but are not limited to, entertainment liaison (ELO) reports or similar internal documents. I request that you search for these documents in any location where they might be located, including but not limited to the entertainment liaison offices, public affairs offices, and communications HQ.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection.

This can be provided by annual purchase requests that are sent to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) by the state point of contact (SPOC). This can also be provided by collated receipts for purchases by the agencies.  All 1122C: Usage Reports and purchase orders submitted by LEAs to the SPOC. According to the 1122 Program Guide, 1122C: Usage Reports and purchase orders are required to be sent to the SPOC within 30 days of purchase. DA Report: total expenditures to the Department of the Army which are reported annually and are releasable. The requested date range of the requested annual reports is 1994 to 2024..\"\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA allows access to \"public records,\" unless the public record requested falls within one of the enumerated statutory exemptions. See 29 Del. C. \u00a710002 (definition of \"public record\" and specific exemptions); 29 Del. C. \u00a7 10003 (setting forth FOIA request procedures).\r\n\r\nThe Department of Safety and Homeland Security (DSHS) has reviewed your FOIA request, and I have attached (three) the responsive records. Additionally, information that is already public is not subject to FOIA.  Please see these public web sites which contains information related to your request.   Any equipment that has been transferred would be available via the LESO website at https://www.dla.mil/Disposition-Services/Offers/Law-Enforcement/Public-Information/.  Additional information is available at https://www.dla.mil/Portals/104/Documents/DispositionServices/LESO/AllStatesAndTerritories_04012024.xlsx?ver=FILIC7hUfEGsazc97C9dbA%3d%3d.\r\n\r\nThe DSHS considers your request closed.\n",

Our search, retrieval, review, redaction, and production charges in complying with this request will be three (3) hours for a total estimate of $137.50 and will require 15 business days for production. The Act also allows for an agency to defer search and retrieval of records until the requester agrees to pay the estimated costs. We ask that you provide confirmation, in writing, to us that you agree to pay these estimated charges.\r\n\r\nBecause a portion of your request is for records of the University\u2019s intercollegiate sports program, I have forwarded it to the University\u2019s Athletic Department for an assessment of the scope of potentially responsive documents, estimation of the costs to search for and produce responsive records, and consideration of potentially applicable exemptions. A written response to this portion of your request will arrive within the time-period specified in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 50-18-71(d.1).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed with the institution portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nUGA Open Records\r\nDivision of Marketing & Communications\r\nHodgson Oil Building, Suite 200 N | 286 Oconee St. | Athens, GA 30602\r\n706-542-8090 | www.uga.edu<http://www.uga.edu/>\r\n[University of Georgia]\r\n[Facebook]<https://www.facebook.com/uga.edu> [Twitter] <https://twitter.com/universityofga>  [Instagram] <https://www.instagram.com/universityofga/>  [Linkedin] <https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=18190>  [Youtube] <https://www.youtube.com/uga>  [Snapchat] <https://www.snapchat.com/add/university-ga>\n",

I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I appeal your search and claim of no records, and your violation of my form and format request.\r\n\r\nAs for form and format, you stated that you were providing one email, and sent it as a PDF. You did not claim any exemptions.\r\n\r\nBy exporting it to PDF, you disregarded my electronic form & format requests \u2014 and you additionally rasterized the record, which I specifically asked you not to do. OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization. I did not consent to you making new, worse records in this way.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email in one of the native electronic email formats listed; any email software will save to them easily.\r\n\r\nMy form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) & (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA & FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for your search and claim of no records, I believe you likely searched the \"FOIA inbox\" account foia@sss.gov. My request was about the chief FOIA officer's emails, i.e. the primary official @sss.gov email used by Craig T. Brown, \"regardless of subject matter\" \u2014 not about FOIA request emails, e.g. not about emails to or from foia@sss.gov. I therefore believe you did not search or provide the records identified, and appeal items 1-3 on that basis.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

Fusus Intelligent AI Alerts automatically notify authorized users when Fusus AI-connected cameras detect pre-defined events (e.g. a fight) or profiles (e.g. a vehicle of interest).

Metadata may include, but is not limited to: the type of alert, the date and time of the alert, who received the alert, locations associated with the alert, and algorithmic confidence scores associated with the alert. This metadata should be stored in a database and so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.
