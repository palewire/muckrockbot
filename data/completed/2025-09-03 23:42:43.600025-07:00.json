I received the initial data in excel but have discovered after review has begun that Fried B contains student identifiable information that must be redacted. This data is scattered intermittently in the field and is much more efficiently redacted in adobe. Therefore I have converted the records to adobe for redaction. \r\n  \r\n Field A however is the class title, which appears to be more what you are looking for. We do not keep these records by university college as you have requested. They will not be provided that way. \r\n  \r\n I have two alternatives for you: \r\n  \r\n Alt 1: Get in excel Field A (only) which is the \"count\" and class abbreviation for each count of academic dishonesty reported to the Dean of Students office. \r\n  \r\n Alt 2: Get Fields A and B in adobe so they can be redacted in accordance with the requirements of federal law. We simply do not have the staff capital to redact in excel which takes at least twice as long as redaction in adobe when we currently have 120 other requesters waiting for records. \r\n  \r\n Please reply by 8.28.25 with you alternative choice. Obviously Alt 1 will be a quick turnaround after that, Alt will take longer. \r\n  \r\n Of you do not reply by August 28th, I will take silence as acceptance of Alt 1 and will reply with that material. You may always make a new request. \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n Julie Laundrie \r\n Public Records Custodian \r\n Office of Compliance \r\n University of Wisconsin-Madison \r\n  \r\n University of Wisconsin-Madison \r\n 500 Lincoln Drive\r\n361 Bascom Hall\r\nMadison, Wisconsin 53706 \r\n (608) 265-6018",

This means that the Attorney General\u2019s Office will not further address the request, and that is the date from which the Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review starts to run. Please contact me within 30 days via email or at Office of the Attorney General, Public Records & Constituent Services, P.O. Box 40100, Olympia, WA 98504-0100, if you have any questions. Thank you.

I think there may have been a missed communication, so I will resubmit my request because I did provide the email signautre so the agency could conduct a search. \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny public information requests submitted to the state by The Foundation for Government Accountability sent on and between January 1, 2018 and Dec. 31, 2024, as well as copies of any replies and information provided by DSS in fulfillment of those requests.\r\nTo help in the agency's search, The Foundation for Government Accountability email addresses end in \"@thefga.org.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This includes county as well as city employees. This is what I'm hoping for in my request and it should be easily accessible through the prosecutor's office. \r\n\r\nAnother county got my request confused and sent letters they received from WAPA that relate to WSP officers on the Brady list. I am not looking for these letters, only the police reports/misconduct records that are local to your jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThank you again for working on my request. I hope this clarifies it further!

They will have her full investigation.  We have legal memorandums, which are attached with this email.\r\n  *   Wallace, Jay \u2013 this is still in pending status and we have no documentation.\r\n  *   Wrightson, James P. \u2013 this is still in pending status and we have no documentation.\r\n  *   Nieder, John \u2013 Mr. Neider was arrested in Skagit county on rape charges.  We do not have Skagit County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigation for this criminal charge.  We have the court charging document, Motion for Probable Cause and Order on First Appearance regarding first arraignment hearing date and bail amount.  These are all court documents and not the investigation.

The other schools we\u2019re contacting for data to use in the trends analysis found that helpful as when we get the data from multiple sources it needs to end up being \u201capples to apples\u201d.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe overall purpose of the project is to do a comparative analysis of admissions for Peer or near-peer colleges and university to identify trends that may impact planning and execution of admissions strategies and goals. To that end we need not only the student demographics, but the application and admissions timelines.\r\n\r\nFor example. If the majority of applicants do not make their decision on completing the application or accepting the offer to attend until shortly before a matriculation date that creates a serious planning issue for Institutions like VMI who have to plan for a wide range and do not have sufficient reaction time to implement mitigations strategies. This would be of benefit to many colleges as we do not believe such analysis is ongoing.\r\n\r\nIn VMI\u2019s case there was one year where it appears due to COVID and other factors enrollment (those who matriculated) was extremely low. If the perspective students did not notify VMI until shortly before (or just did not show up) it puts the school in a bind to provide opportunities to others and, more importantly, may have left some good potential students without sufficient time to react and arrive to matriculate.\r\n\r\nIt is one goal to see what the trend is for today\u2019s freshmen on when they make the decisions and what visibility schools have of that.\r\n\r\nAcademic years covered:\r\n\r\n2015 - 2016\r\n2016 - 2017\r\n2017 - 2018\r\n2018 - 2019\r\n2019 - 2020\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nREQUEST 1: An excel or .CSV file of the entire SSR database (report) as provided in the last FOIA with all fields, except for PII and an explanation of the field codes.\r\n\r\nThis would be the best as it would require little to no level of effort on VMI\u2019s part to simply export the entire file(s) without any PII fields. \r\n\r\nWe respectfully request this as it may have some fields we do not know exist in the report/database that could be valuable in our research.\r\n\r\nALETRNATE: If it is not possible to just provide files of the entire database (minus PII) we request the following.\r\n\r\n1.\tA list of all SSR codes and their meaning for all fields in the SSR Database.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe breakout of ALL applicants to VMI by race, ethnicity, gender, and within each of those, which were athletes and non-athletes:\r\n\r\na.\tDate of initial contact\r\nb.\tDate of Initial Application\r\nc.\tDate of full application competition\r\nd.\tDate Accepted or Declined by VMI (i.e. Appointment or denied appointment)\r\ne.\tDate of partial deposit\r\nf.\tDate of full deposit\r\ng.\tDate CAD- cancelled after paying the deposit (but before becoming a full reservation)\r\nh.\tDate CBD- cancelled before paying the deposit\r\ni.\tDate CR- cancelled after becoming a full reservation (deposit paid and medicals approved)\r\nj.\tDate TDMD- appointed but medically disqualified\r\nk.\tDate MT- matriculated\r\nl.\tOther fields that will allow developing trends and profiles of the timeline between cadets applying to VMI and final disposition if they attend or not.\r\n\r\n3. The number and dollar value of each scholarship or tuition assistance for each MT cadet by race, ethnicity, gender, and within each of those, which were athletes and non-athletes, with the source of funding (e.g., VMI Agencies, Federal Government, VMI internal funds, other).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

You have not paid for this request; and 2.) Since this has come up in several of your responses, you are not paying for records. Rather, you are paying for the cost of VMI to fulfill your requests. It is entirely possible that a requester pays for a request to be fulfilled, and they do not receive any responsive records because the records are exempt from disclosure or do not exist. Please keep in mind you are paying for the time that VMI employees are taken away from our mission of training and educating citizen-soldiers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the responsive records provided, the InDate and CmpDate are not included in the SSR report for the Class of 2028 and beyond. That data is not imported from the CommonApp into VMI\u2019s student information system and is, therefore, not available in the 2028 and future reports. To add it to the dataset would constitute the creation of a new record which VMI is under no obligation to do (Va.

        "communication": "I understand that  completely and wish to avoid the semantics of \"paying for records\" versus \"paying for the time to collect the records.\" In the end, the cost paid is to \"obtain the records\" regardless of what that funding goes to.  It's irrelevant to the issue at hand.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the situation is simple. ALL of the records provided, apparently from the SAME database, from 2019 - 2027 have the same fields.  With the the 2028 date, apparently from the same database,  the following two fields were NOT in the exported spreadsheet:\r\n\r\n1. Field \"InDate\" - Application Start Date (InDate): the date each applicant to the Class of 2028 began their application.\r\n\r\n2. Field \"CmpDate\" - Application Completion Date (CmpDate): the date each applicant to the Class of 2028 completed their application file.\r\n\r\nI brought that to your attention in the context that it likely resulted from an error in exporting the file, which did not include those fields in the Excel file, and I asked you to correct it.  I should not reasonably be expected to pay for additional \"time\" to fix this. Seems to me a simple matter.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, your response raises some straightforward questions.\r\n\r\n1. If those fields NO LONGER exist in the database after 2027, then VMI is NO LONGER TRACKING the Date a potential Cadet Starts and application, and the Date a potential Cadet completes an application, thereby changing your way of doing business for the previous EIGHT YEARS. In this case, a \"no responsive records, VMI no longer collects the Application start and completion dates\" would suffice.\r\n\r\n2. If you do still collect that data, it was requested in the FOIA, and you did not provide it in that second file, so I am simply asking that it be corrected.\r\n\r\nRegarding the other requests, your responses to my inquiry about missing records are incomplete at best.  If a requester requests records, any normally operating FOIA office returns a response with the requested records (and, in some cases, the \"work\" paid for), then annotates the request with a simple explanation stating that \"Record XXX does not exist.\"  \r\n\r\nThis eliminates the perception (as there clearly is here) that the agency is only selectively releasing records.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all I reasonably expect from this FOIA is that VMI either say you no longer track those two important data fields or simply fix what I originally considered a simple processing error (but now have my doubts).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response.\r\n\r\nOnce you either provide the data I am charged for or explain why it does not exist anymore at VMI I will pay you for your \"time\".",

However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how this large sum of allocated funds is being distributed across the county.\r\n I am a student reporter at West Virginia University and intend to use this information to more accurately report on these findings. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.

Your request was received in this office on 5/24/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.If you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

For case records, contact Austin Police Department. For the other responsive TCSO records, please refer to the email sent to you from our Travis County Attorney\u2019s Office. After examining the requested information we have determined that you may inspect and/or duplicate much of this information, as provided under the Texas Public Information Act. Accordingly please find attached responsive information for your review with the exception of the information outlined below:\r\n\r\n1. We have redacted driver's license/motor vehicle information protected under Section 552.130 of the Government Code. The law enforcement records you have requested contain information that relates to:\r\n\r\n(a) a motor vehicle operator\u2019s or driver\u2019s license or permit issued by an agency of this state or another state or country; or\r\n\r\n(b) a motor vehicle title or registration issued by an agency of this state or another state or country;\r\n\r\n(c) or a personal identification document issued by an agency of this state or another state or country or a local agency authorized to issue an identification document.\r\n\r\nThis information is confidential under sections 552.130, 552.137 and 552.101 of the Texas Government Code. Our office is prohibited by law from releasing this information to you, and therefore we have removed this information from the enclosed information we are providing to you. Normally, we must request a ruling from the Texas Attorney General before we can withhold any of the information you requested. However, section 552.130 and 552.137 allows us to withhold this specific information without requesting a ruling from the attorney general.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal our decision to withhold this information from you. Instructions for appeal are at the end of this letter. If you do not want to appeal, you do not need to do anything else. Please note that we are only withholding the specific categories of information that are confidential under section 552.130, 552.137 and 552.101. We will process the rest of your request for information in accordance with the terms of the Public Information Act.\r\n\r\n2. With regard to the date of birth information contained in TCSO's records, the Office of the Attorney General OR2019-05541 (see attached). The ruling creates a previous determination allowing TCSO to withhold a public citizen\u2019s date of birth pursuant to section 552.101 of the Government Code in conjunction with common-law privacy without seeking and Attorney General ruling. Therefore, this information is redacted.\r\n\r\nHow to appeal the withholding of information under Gov\u2019t Code section 552.130 and 552.137\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal the withholding of information discussed on the previous page, you must send the following to the attorney general:\r\n\r\n1) a signed, written statement indicating your wish to appeal the withholding of information;\r\n\r\n2) the name of the governmental body that withheld information from you;\r\n\r\n3) the date you made your original request for information; and\r\n\r\n4) a copy of your original request for information, or if you are unable to provide a copy, a description of your original request for information.\r\n\r\nYou may also submit written comments stating why you think the information should be released to you, but you are not required to do so.\r\n\r\nSend your appeal by mail to the attorney general at:\r\n\r\nOpen Records Division\r\nP.O. Box 12548\r\nAustin, Texas 78711-2548\r\n\r\nWithin forty-five business days after receiving all of the above-listed items necessary to file your appeal, the attorney general will issue a written ruling on the matter. You will receive a copy of this ruling in the mail.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions in this regard, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nTravis County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2013 Paralegal Operations\r\nPO Box 1748, Austin, Texas 78767\r\nOffice: 512-854-9718\r\nE-Mail: tcsor@traviscountytx.gov<mailto:tcsor@traviscountytx.gov>\r\nWebsite: www.tcsheriff.org<http://www.tcsheriff.org/>\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nThis electronic mail message, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged under applicable law.

RESPONSE : In the spirit of cooperation, documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center. Please visit the link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . This data was pulled as of point in time, June 9, 2025. Be advised that providing the data you seek \u201cbased on annual membership file as of June 9, 2025\u201d would require the district to create records that are not maintained in the regular course of business. Data analysts would be required to pull each portion of your request; datasets would have to be joined, and the data would have to be verified in order to create the record you seek. This process is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions or prepare researched records in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. \r\nThank you for your request. Sincerely, \r\nAna Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",
