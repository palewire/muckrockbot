I request any and all documents pertaining to DoD support for \"The Blue Angels.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"The Blue Angels,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication. I request a search of all locations where such documents might be located, including but not limited to the entertainment liaison offices and communications HQ or similar offices.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

In accordance with Section 3(e) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/3(e)), ISP is extending the response due date for an additional five business days for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe requested records are stored in whole or in part at another location.\r\n\r\nThe request requires the collection of a substantial number of records.\r\n\r\nThe request is stated in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records requested.\r\n\r\nX  The requested records have not yet been located and additional time is needed to complete the search.\r\n\r\nX  The requested records require examination and evaluation to determine if the documents are exempt from disclosure and/or must be redacted.\r\n\r\nX  The requested records cannot be provided within the prescribed time frame without causing an undue burden or interfering with the operation of ISP.\r\n\r\nConsultation is needed with another public body in order to respond to the request.\r\n\r\nISP handles requests for video records separately.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to the architect Paul Albert Thiry (born September 11th, 1904 - died 1993). Of particular interest would be personal correspondence between Paul Thiry and directors L. Patrick Gray, Bill Ruckelshaus and Clarence Kelley regarding the planning, design, dedication of, and reaction to, the opening of the J. Edgar Hoover Building on September 30th of 1975. Mr. Thiry acted as a consultant during this process. Thiry was also actively engaged in civic issues in the city of Seattle. Thiry was also appointed by President Kennedy to the U.S. Capitol Planning Commission and the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue - both appointments who have presumably generated a background check and documentation from the bureau. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the architect Paul Albert Thiry from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Thiry held by the Seattle Field Office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Paul Albert Thiry. \r\n\r\nFor a brief synopsis of his career please see:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.docomomo-wewa.org/architect/thiry-paul/\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Paul Thiry.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Paul Thiry. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: A previous FOIA request to the bureau, \"FBI file 66-HQ-11201 \" titled: \"Planning And Design of the FBI Headquarters Building 66-HQ-11201\" mentions Thiry by name. Please disregard this document in your search.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Dear Department of Transportation:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Transportation component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request imposes an affirmative obligation to take immediate steps to preserve responsive records against spoliation, including both any automated or routine record deletion and any act by an employee to delete such records.\r\n\r\nThis is an explicit evidence preservation demand, and the documents sought relate to ongoing and/or currently contemplated litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, please note that this request is directed at BOTH Department of Transportation itself, and ALL components thereof, including any component agencies.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n\r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Chief FOIA Officers' desktops\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. for the component's\r\na) Chief FOIA Officer,\r\nb) Chief Privacy Officer, and\r\nc) any substantially equivalent component official\r\n\r\n(\"Officer\"):\r\n\r\n2. the entire content of\r\na) the Officer's physical desktops, i.e. everything on the actual desk(s) where they work\r\n\r\nI) including all other office surfaces, e.g. cabinets, tables, in/out boxes, shelves, etc in the Officer's office(s)\r\n\r\nII) excluding:\r\ni) computers (including desktop, laptop, and phone);\r\nii) USB drives;\r\niii) generic office supplies, i.e. any item that could be purchased off the shelf at a store such as Office Depot in identical form by a member of the general public;\r\niv) tear-off daily flip calendars;\r\nv) purely personal capacity items;\r\nvi) keys;\r\nvii) anything within a fully enclosed hard sided container (e.g. exclude the contents of a desk / cabinet drawer, lockbox, or picture frame \u2014 but envelopes laying on a desk [and their contents], items in open-ended organizers, etc are not excluded);\r\nviii) books or hard-bound booklets, except for the front and back covers; and\r\nix) CDs or DVDs, except for the label (i.e. what is captured when you place the disc on a flatbed scanner); and\r\n\r\nIII) formatted as 600 DPI color scans to PDF, one PDF per item (named logically based on the item), run through Adobe Acrobat Pro's \"enhance scanned PDF\" tool with the settings:\r\n* recognize text on\r\n* all pages\r\n* apply adaptive compression: grayscale JPEG2000, monochrome JBIG2 (lossless), maximum quality\r\n* output: searchable image, document language set to the document's actual language\r\n* filters: deskew on, background removal off, descreen off, text sharpening off;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nb) the Officer's computer desktop(s), i.e. the \"desktop folder\" of their account on every computer that they use in official capacity\r\n\r\nI) in the exact original file format as stored on the computer, encapsulated into a .ZIP or .TAR.GZ archive set to preserve all metadata and folder structure;\r\n\r\n3. as the above exist at the time anyone in the component first learns of this request.\r\n\r\n(I.e., no clearing out the desk before searching it. You may of course continue to use the office normally, but this request creates a hold for its exact content at that one snapshot in time.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. For hold preservation validation purposes, please take and provide digital photos of the Officer's entire office, showing all items in plain view at the time this request was received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe search time for this request should be zero, since all responsive records are literally already in plain view in the Officer's office.\r\n\r\nThis request is very clearly delineated such that search should be easy and the locations of records clearly identified.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to negotiate terms, we are open to doing so, but only if you provide actual reasons, not conclusory and inapposite statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.0\r\n###\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1.\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

Cc: 'Brett Baker' <brett.baker@nara.gov>\r\n\r\nRelevant text states:\r\nAfter posting my public comments below, please post to the Chief FOIA Officers website this public comment entitled, \"Response to Archivist Re: Equity - The Uncommon Man\"\r\n\r\nI have submitted this same comment multiple times. Mr. Ferriero continues to address equity in his public comments to the FOIA Advisory Committee and the Chief FOIA Officers Council, therefor DOJ and OGIS must post my thoughtful and uplifting comments. If not posted by April 15, 2022, I am asking NARA OIG to open an investigation and advise me of same. Ms. Gupta? Ms. Wall?\r\n\r\nThe file name of the PDF that I am seeking is: Response to Hon. David S. Ferriero June 10, 2021 Comments to FOIA Advisory Committee.pdf\r\n\r\n2.\tI am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record subject to that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am seeking an ADA accessible PDF file with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. \r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest. I am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES. \r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination.\r\n1.\tThe  subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na.\tThe next Chief FOIA Officers Concil is April 21, 202 where this matter will be addressed.\r\n\r\n2.\tInformation is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na.\tSee paragraph 1 above.\r\nb.\tI am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media.\r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification  as to how my request stated herein does not qualify.\r\n\r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY.  This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default. \r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. \r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later. \r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. \r\n\r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues. \r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action  I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter.  No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data.  Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).  \r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nALTERATION/DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1519 - Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records.

The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(F)(i).\r\n\r\nPERJURY\r\nWhoever-\r\n(1) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\r\n(2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\r\nis guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your agency has also been subject to litigation for failures to administer proper procedures that have resulted in deaths from a mass shooting (Parkland, FL).  I feel the information as presented shows an overwhelming government interest in the agency maintaining public trust adhering to transparency and guiding its own public image or lack thereof. \r\n\r\nAgain, you are petitioned to waive the fees in the public interest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. Any and all documents relating to or filed in connection with school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).

Please log in to the Public Records Center using the following link to retrieve the responsive documents:\u00a0City of Springfield Public Records Portal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that redactions have been made pursuant to M.G.L. ch. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c) (also known as \u201cExemption (c)\u2019 \u2013 \u2018The Privacy Exemption\u201d), M.G.L. ch. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a) (also known as \u201cExemption (a)\u2019 \u2013 \u2018The Statutory Exemption\u201d) under M.G.L. ch. 41, \u00a7 97D and M.G.L. ch. 119, \u00a7 60A.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExemption (c) allows for the withholding of personnel files, medical files, and other information and materials whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; except records related to a law enforcement misconduct investigation. See M.G. L. ch. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c). All information that could identify a victim or minor and sensitive data related to specifically named individuals have been redacted for privacy including names, residential addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, court docket numbers, and warrant numbers. Furthermore, all records of domestic violence and/or abuse of a household or family member have been redacted in their entirety.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExemption (a) prohibits the release of materials that are \u201cspecifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d The applicable statute that the City is required to withhold certain records under exemption (a) is M.G.L. ch. 41, \u00a7 97D which states that \"all reports of rape and sexual assault or attempts to commit such offenses, all reports of abuse perpetrated by family or household members, as defined in section 1 of chapter 209A, and all communications between police officers and victims of such offenses or abuse shall not be public reports.\" All reports involving domestic violence, or abuse of a household or family member have been redacted. Therefore all information related to arrests that occurred for domestic violence or abuse of a household or family member has been redacted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurthermore, M.G.L. ch. 119, \u00a7 60A states that \u201cdelinquency records shall be withheld from public inspection except with the consent of a justice of such court; provided, however, that such records shall be open, at all reasonable times, to inspection by the child proceeded against, his parents, guardian or attorney; provided further, that nothing herein shall be construed to provide access to privileged or confidential communications and information; and provided further, that said protections shall be construed to include information and communications entered at the indictment.\u201d Therefore, all information that identifies a juvenile has been redacted including names, residential addresses, docket numbers, and warrant numbers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease note that M.G.L. ch. 119, \u00a7 60A allows for the juvenile, the juvenile's guardian, and the juvenile's attorney to access redacted records. These individuals can request their records from the Police Department Clerk\u2019s Office in person with a copy of their government-issued photo identification and proof of representation (if applicable) at Springfield Police Department's Clerk's Office, located at 130 Pearl Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you be aggrieved by this response, you may appeal to the Supervisor of Public Records in the Massachusetts Secretary of State\u2019s Office pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.00 and M.G.L. ch. 66, \u00a7 10(b). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease contact the Public Records Division by responding to this email or by phone at (413) 787-6085 with any questions. Please reference your Public Records Request number in all correspondence regarding this request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPublic Records Division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Springfield, MA.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection.

However, if a custodian believes it will take more than 10 business days to respond to the request, the custodian must notify the requestor in writing or by email within that time period of the following: the amount of time it will take to produce the public record, an estimate of fees (if applicable) and the reason for the delay. Additionally, please note that under Section 4-206 of the PIA, a custodian may charge a fee for the search for, preparation of, and reproduction of a public record; this fee prorated for each individual's salary and actual time attributable to the search for and preparation of a public record. In addition, per Howard County Council Resolution No. 68-2022, the County charges a copying fee of $0.25 per page for a black and white paper copy. If electronic copies of the responsive records exist, they are free of charge; however, when an electronic response, or portion thereof, is too large to send electronically, the response, or portion thereof, will be provided either in paper format, or electronically on a CD, DVD or flash drive, as the requester specifies. The cost of a CD, DVD or flash drive is the actual cost of the CD, DVD, or flash drive. \nFor more information on the PIA, please visit Maryland\u2019s Office of the Attorney General website at http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/OpenGov/pia.aspx.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989).

I request COPIES of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your agency procedures for the processing of public records requests.\r\n\r\n2. I request COPIES of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your publicly posted agency policy regarding the processing of public records requests.\r\n\r\n3. I request COPIES of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your agency policy, procedures, best practices, and guidelines regarding communications between your agency and public records requestors \u2013 specifically any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding the use of email in communication for the receipt and production of public records, as well as the use of email in communications regarding clarification of public records requests by your agency.\r\n\r\n4. I request COPIS of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your agency policy, procedures, best practices, and guidelines regarding your agency's use of any 3rd party \"portal\" or online data products in the processing of public records requests including but not limited to the use of GOVQA, Next-Request, Just FOIA, or any other online data product.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE - DO NOT DELAY PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY OF REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS IN BAD FAITH\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 (8) An agency can only seek a clarification when the request is objectively \"unclear.\" Seeking a \"clarification\" of an objectively clear request delays access to public records.\r\n\r\nDo not delay production of copies of records responsive to this public records request by sending emails seeking redundant \"confirmation\" the requestor still wants the records originally requested. This request should remain open and production of copies of responsive public records requested should continue until complete.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever.

The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989).

The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE - DO NOT DELAY PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY OF REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS IN BAD FAITH\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 (8) An agency can only seek a clarification when the request is objectively \"unclear.\" Seeking a \"clarification\" of an objectively clear request delays access to public records.\r\n\r\nDo not delay production of copies of records responsive to this public records request by sending emails seeking redundant \"confirmation\" the requestor still wants the records originally requested. This request should remain open and production of copies of responsive public records requested should continue until complete. The requestor WANTS COPIES OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTED.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\n**Please see the attachment for additional information**\r\n\r\n**REGULAR EMAIL RESPONSE \u2013 DO NOT CORRESPOND VIA GOVQA MESSAGING**\r\n\r\nPreferred Method to Receive Records:\r\nRegular Mail\u201d\r\n\r\nThe City interprets your request as seeking policies and procedures related to the City's current practices for receipt of and response to Public Records Requests. Please see the City's Public Disclosure Website, reachable by the following links.\r\n\r\nhttps://tacoma.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(pi4wl0cafgqiaruqcf5up1cm))/supporthome.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request is closed as of the date of this letter. The City does not intend to further address your request and the one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review begins to run as of the date of this letter.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to assist you.  Please contact me within 30 days of this letter 11/30/24, if you have any questions.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nBrandie Marshall\r\nPublic Disclosure Analyst\r\nPublic Records Office\r\n(253) 231-0236",

Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.
