This information will be useful to academics, journalists, members of the public, and other law enforcement agencies. So far, hundreds of agencies across the United States have already provided this data. You can see many of the previous results here: https://www.eff.org/pages/explore-alpr\r\n\r\nFor items 1-4: This information is easily available within the Agency\u2019s Vigilant Solutions LEARN system. The simplest way to extract this data is to generate an \u201cAgency Data Sharing Report\u201d PDF file from within LEARN. To do this, a user may simply go to the \u201cSharing\u201d section of LEARN and select \u201cOutput Report.\u201d A CSV/XLS file containing these records would also satisfy this request.\r\n\r\nThe instructions for extracting this data is described on pages 62-63 of the LEARN Agency Manager Guide, which may be found at this link:\r\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3860685-LEARN-5-1-Agency-Manager-Guide.html\r\n\r\nFor items 5-8: This information is easily available within the Agency\u2019s Vigilant Solutions LEARN system. The simplest way to extract this data is to generate a \u201cDashboard Hit Ratio Report\u201d PDF file from within LEARN.
