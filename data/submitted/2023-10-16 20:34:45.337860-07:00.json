Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of Captain Sentry. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to the Air Force's decision to create the mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Captain Sentry-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes that take the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, photographs, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Captain Sentry Sentry costumes, such as the one depicted in the attached photo and at the following links: \r\nhttps://www.507arw.afrc.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2003245926/ \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/552acw/posts/363945359110596/. \r\nResponsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Captain Sentry.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Captain Sentry (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any Congressional member, office, committee, or staff.

Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using the Captain Sentry mascot.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

While this visit is discussed in the country of Georgia, there appears to be little to no information about the visit. \r\n\r\nPlease include the following in this request:\r\n\r\nAll photographs or photographic negatives in the agency's possession of Nixon's visit that day. Nixon traveled to polling places and met with Zviad Gamsakhurdia and other prominent Georgians. \r\n\r\nAny correspondence between Richard Nixon and the following CIA officials (Director William Webster, Deputy Richard James Kerr or Robert Gates) where the topic of the correspondence was either the planning for the Tbilisi visit or discussions of impressions or ramifications  of the visit. \r\n\r\nAny collection, translation or interpretations of foreign news media coverage (including but not limited to Georgian and Russian language media) about the political ramifications of Nixon's visit to Georgia on March 31st of 1991. \r\n\r\nAny agency documents which might be understood to be a \"narrative\" of the visit or a written documentation of Nixon's itinerary as recorded by an agency employee or source. \r\n\r\nAny agency documents which might be understood to be a \"narrative\" of the visit or a written documentation of Nixon's itinerary from any source, currently maintained in the agency's records. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA act provides that if portions of a document are exempt from release, the remainder must be segregated and disclosed. Therefore, I will expect you to send all nonexempt portions of the records which I have requested, and ask that you justify any deletions be referencing the specific provisions of the FOI act used to justify the deletions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency, and I look forward to continue working on this request. This granting of this request would have significant historical value for both the United States and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
