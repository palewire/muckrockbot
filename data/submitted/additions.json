Any and all agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), authorizations, or written permissions between the City of Clinton and Laurens County (or any of its departments) that authorize Clinton Sanitation to dispose of waste at the Laurens County Transfer Station (formerly the old Laurens landfill).\r\n\r\n2. Weigh tickets, intake logs, daily reports, manifests, billing statements, or invoices documenting any waste received from the City of Clinton or its sanitation department, including waste routed to Twin Chimney landfill.\r\n\r\n3. Internal emails, letters, or communications between Laurens County staff or officials and the City of Clinton (or its sanitation department) regarding trash disposal, dump site access, or waste transport arrangements.\r\n\r\n4. Any records or documentation maintained by Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department that reference the City of Clinton\u2019s use of county-operated waste facilities or routes used to deliver municipal waste.\r\n\r\nThis request follows a prior FOIA submission that was denied based on the claim that no responsive records exist. However, recent public statements from a sanitation worker have confirmed daily waste disposal operations by Clinton at the Laurens County Transfer Station, which is operated by the Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department. This indicates responsive documents do, in fact, exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdwin Chadwick",
