        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, s. 286.011, F.S., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request the following records, within the time frame of 2017 to 2023. to the date on which this request is processed, and with respect to the following criteria and within the jurisdiction of the Agency for Healthcare Administration (ACHA):\r\n\r\n1a. Records that detail the consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions that can be taken against a healthcare facility in summation and if there exists any meaningful difference in terms of potential for disciplinary action according to precise setting (ie, hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory clinics, and so on), within the context of the scope and authority of the ACHA.\r\n\r\n1b. Contingent upon there existing a meaningful difference in potential for disciplinary actions according to the precise setting (ie, a hospital setting versus a nursing home setting versus an ambulatory clinic) then I request records that separate out the disciplinary action for each type of healthcare facility.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the precise scope of the ACHA itself as it relates to its investigative authority, power, and methods employed when investigating healthcare facilities. Additionally, I request the persons with which possess such investigative authority by listing position titles within ACHA.\r\n\r\n3. Records, manuals, and/or guidelines that detail how the ACHA handles complaints of healthcare facilities. Additionally, I request if ACHA makes use of or employs artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs) in the handling of either complaints or investigations into healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail the precise scope and investigatory authority, power, methods employed (in the context of an investigation) as well as the precise extent of persons with investigative authority as deemed by ACHA. Additionally, if it is the case that multiple persons (meaning greater than one position title at ACHA has investigative authority) then I request records that separate both the position titles and the meaning distinction in terms of investigative authority, power, scope, and employed employed according to each position title (if such a notion and if such records exist within ACHA). \r\n\r\n5. Records that detail the complete listing of agencies with which the ACHA [regularly] cooperates with as it relates to investigations into healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate an approximate time frame for this request to be processed. Depending on the time frame for the request to be fulfilled and any fees that may be incurred, I may revise the criteria.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",
