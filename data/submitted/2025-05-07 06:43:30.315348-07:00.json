The records I am requesting include, but are not limited to, alleged criminal conduct pertaining to the Electrospray Thruster Array Technology Feasibility Study, which was funded, in part, by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a search of your agency's general and/or central indices I request that your agency also search: 1) Any \"cross-referenced\" records relevant to this inquiry; and, 2) \"ELSUR\" (Electronic Surveillance) records; and, 3) the Sentinel database; and, 4) the Investigative Data Warehouse; and, 5) the Data Integration and Visualization System.\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all responsive records at all relevant FBI offices and facilities including, but not limited to, HQ and relevant field offices in Los Angeles County, California.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the location of the requested records I am providing the following list of names that may be associated with these allegations and any related FBI investigation: Amir Gat, Sandra Troian, Daniel Weihs, Morteza Gharib, Kelly M. Sullivan, and, David Tsang.\r\n\r\nUpon information and belief, Kelly M. Sullivan and David Tsang were FBI agents with the Los Angeles County Counterintelligence Division at the times relevant to this request. The personal names provided above should not be construed as a basis for limiting the scope of this records request.\r\n\r\nIn order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a representative of the news media affiliated with the Randolph Bourne Institute and its media outlet, Antiwar.com. This request is made as part of news gathering and not for a commercial use.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. Specifically, this information will help advance public understanding of foreign intelligence activities targeted against the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The records I am requesting include, but are not limited to, alleged criminal conduct pertaining to the Electrospray Thruster Array Technology Feasibility Study, which was funded, in part, by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a search of your agency's general and/or central indices I request that your agency also search: 1) Any \"cross-referenced\" records relevant to this inquiry; and, 2) \"ELSUR\" (Electronic Surveillance) records; and, 3) the Sentinel database; and, 4) the Investigative Data Warehouse; and, 5) the Data Integration and Visualization System.\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all responsive records at all relevant FBI offices and facilities including, but not limited to, HQ and relevant field offices in Los Angeles County, California.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the location of the requested records I am providing the following list of names that may be associated with these allegations and any related FBI investigation: Amir Gat, Sandra Troian, Daniel Weihs, Morteza Gharib, Kelly M. Sullivan, and, David Tsang.\r\n\r\nUpon information and belief, Kelly M. Sullivan and David Tsang were FBI agents with the Los Angeles County Counterintelligence Division at the times relevant to this request. The personal names provided above should not be construed as a basis for limiting the scope of this records request.\r\n\r\nIn order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a representative of the news media affiliated with the Randolph Bourne Institute and its media outlet, Antiwar.com. This request is made as part of news gathering and not for a commercial use.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. Specifically, this information will help advance public understanding of foreign intelligence activities targeted against the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichelle Kinnucan",
