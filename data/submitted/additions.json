I informed \u201cDFAS\u201d that I, do believe that someone else is receiving my \u201cSBP\u201d other than myself. One hour after, I received the email a very \u201cSTRANGE\u201d TRANSACTION APPEARED ON MY PHONE\u201d confirming my request for an \u201cINVESTIGATION\u201d. DFAS has \u201cFAILED\u201d to give me my \u201cSBP\u201d and another, \u201cWIDOWS\u201d ID CARD, that was \u201cSTOLEN\u201d FROM ME ON, FORT BRAGG, NC by, Amy Melendez and Joanie Hammons.

I do believe ID Cards have been issued in my name to keep these criminal activities \u201cCOVERED-UP\u201d. I do believe that my late husband, Robert Gribble (Date of Death, 11/18/2011) have been \u201cSANITIZED\u201d OUT OF THE SYSTEM. Robert Gribble, last four is: 5802. I am requesting  the \u201cDIVORCE DECREE\u201d per \u201cDFAS\u201d that has a \u201c1999\u201d Date on it, \u201cCOURT STAMPED AND CERTIFIED\u201d showing dates and the Court House information. I am requesting \u201cALL\u201d the documents to include \u201cPAYMENTS\u201d made with my \u201cPII\u201d Personal Identifying Information. I am requesting that I am to receive another, ID CARD via by mail, as it shows in \u201cMY AUTH\u201d, however someone in the \u201cIT DEPARTMENT\u201d has blocked my ability to be able to complete this process. I am requesting \u201cALL\u201d Records of money paid to myself and my late husband, Robert Gribble. I am requesting \u201cACCESS\u201d TO \u201cMY PAY\u201d Credentials to create my password and login ID, by receiving my temporary password. DFAS, has \u201cBLOCKED\u201d, \u201cREMOVED\u201d my late husband, Robert Gribble from \u201cDFAS\u201d to \u201cNOT\u201d AWARD ME MY \u201cSBP\u201d who Retired from the United States Army in 1972.
