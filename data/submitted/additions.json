Any and all records or documents that show the total number of Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests received by the New York State Department of Health from January 1, 2023, to the present date.\r\n2. Any and all records or documents that show the number of FOIL requests that have been fulfilled within the statutory response time during the same period.\r\n3. Any and all records or documents that show the number of FOIL requests that are currently pending or have been delayed beyond the statutory response time during the same period.\r\n\r\nI understand that the Department is not required to create new records in response to a FOIL request. However, I believe that the requested information is likely contained in existing records, such as internal reports or databases, and I am specifically requesting access to these existing records.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of expediting this request, I am willing to accept records that cover a shorter time period or a subset of the requested information if the full request cannot be fulfilled within the statutory response time.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
