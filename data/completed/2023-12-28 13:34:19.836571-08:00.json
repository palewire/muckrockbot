Thank you, Andrew Free #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative Al Otro Lado.  Your request was received in this office on 11/13/2022.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process.

We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

In our records search Bert Ulrich identified the films corresponding to each Space Act Agreement (SAA) as being the only movies NASA collaborated with, and provided the agreements as part of the list. I apologize for not explaining this more clearly and also not explaining that those SAAs for each movie is a complete list of movies for the time period specified in the request.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned NASA\u2019s Records Retention Schedule, which is available at following web address: https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/NPR_attachments/NRRS_1441.1.pdf. If permanent records exist they may have been sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in accordance with the Federal Records Act and NASA Records Record Retention Schedule. NARA\u2019s contact is available at the following website: https://www.archives.gov/foia/contacts.html.\r\n\r\nWe also talked about NASA points of contact who have their email and phone numbers listed online for media outlets and media researchers. You can find those contacts at the following website (some have email addresses and phone numbers listed) : https://www.nasa.gov/news/media-contacts/.\r\n\r\nHopefully this information is helpful.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny and all records mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry into William David Foreman, also known as David Foreman or Dave Foreman. Mr. Foreman was a prominent environmental activist for over four decades and was co-founder of the organizations Earth First! and the Rewilding Institute as well as the founding publisher of the Earth First Journal.\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman was born on Oct. 18, 1946, in Albuquerque and died on Sept. 19, 2022, in Albuquerque. Specific proof of death is not required as Mr. Foreman\u2019s death has been widely publicized. This is a link to his obituary published in The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/us/david-foreman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release. For this request, the term \u201call records\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, any and all documents, correspondence (including, but not limited to, inter and/or intra-agency correspondence as well as correspondence with entities or individuals outside the federal government such as the subject and/or his affiliates, agents, contractors, representatives or lawyers), emails, letters, notes, audio or video recordings, telephone records, voicemails, telephone notes, telephone logs, text messages, chat messages, minutes, memoranda, comments, files, presentations, consultations, assessments, evaluations, schedules, papers published and/or unpublished, reports, studies, photographs and other images, and/or all other responsive records, in draft or final form.  This includes all attachments and/or linked documents noted in the responsive records.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press, and is made in the process of news gathering. The responsive records will also be provided to nonprofit public interest environmental organizations. As the requester, I am a qualified researcher with a nonprofit environmental organization, and will release and share the records in order to inform the public about Mr. Foreman\u2019s work and activities and to contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of the operations and actions of a government agency. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a fee waiver is not granted and there are fees as a result, I would appreciate if you would inform me of the estimated charges to receive the records in advance, if the estimated cost is expected to be more than $25.00.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that any of the responsive records will be exempt from disclosure, as FOIA exemptions must be identified, applied narrowly, and justified by the agency in light of the particular exemption as applied. However, if you determine that responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please separate the exempt portions from the nonexempt portions and release the nonexempt portions. For any records that you determine to be exempt from release, please provide a specific description of the agency record or portion of the record along with a particularized description of the legal basis for withholding it and the FOIA-recognized harm that the agency believes would warrant the withholding. \r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the responsive records electronically, if possible, by electronic download from a website, by attachment to email, or by CD or thumbnail digital storage. If the responsive records are not available electronically, then I request that you mail copies to me using the contact information below.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJennifer Thurston",

With respect to when the 10 days begins to run, California Code of Civil Procedure section 12 provides that the \u201ctime in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, the 10 day period for response to a PRA request would begin the day after receipt of the PRA request.  For example, if an agency received a PRA request on Monday, September 25, the 10 day period would begin on Tuesday, September 26 and expire on Thursday, October 5.\r\n\r\nDo you need more time?\r\n\r\nMolly",
