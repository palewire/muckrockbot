I know the Agency is in possession of a large number of these documents and it is long over due for them to be presented to the public and the families of those affected.\r\n\r\nSS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (from here on referred to as SS General) Hans Kammler Dr. Engineer (alternate mis-spellings of his name have been found in official files prior, so please expand searches). The SS General was in charge of numerous German special projects, THE J\u00c4GERSTAB, the rocket forces and underground production and research facilities. ALL captured by US forces in 1945 April and May 1945, These locations listed below were investigated fully, all content was documented, photographed, and much content, equipment, machinery, plane, rocket parts and research removed by US forces. By Air-force Intelligence, OSS, Army investigators, CIOS and several others. These locations were handed over to US forces on orders of General Hans Kammler on May 7, I also requesting release of ALL this documentation, the photographs, films and inventory lists created. Including reports made on this location and adjacent related locations.. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request information about which US companies that the collected information and German research was handed over to. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request ALL information about SS General Hans Kammler generated during and AFTER WW2. And all information regarding the SS Generals interactions with OSS agents, during the war and after, and Furthermore all documentation regarding the SS Generals life post- war. His interrogations and collaborations with US entities after 1945. And I request information of the SS Generals final resting place. \r\nGiven the nature of the German research and the SS Generals expertise this information may have been decentralized to various agencies, As it appears he lived in the US under a new name multiple agencies would have files on Hans Kammler none of these have yet been declassified and it is time to do this now. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities I request ALL information to be released and de-classified on, are the following:\r\n\r\nAustria, St. Georgen Gusen (Near Linz) \r\nCode name: Bergkristall,B8 or Esche or Georgenm\u00fchle M\u00f6glegrube and the parallel underground production factory Kellerbau both run by the SS. Bergkristall was a huge underground factory and research system, producing mainly ME262 Jets and V2 Parts and other. Run by the SS with labor from local KZ camp Mauthausen. It was handed over to US Army troops in early May 1945, intact, SS General Kammler was there on May 4th. several weeks later it was handed over to the Russian army. it was surveyed, documented and filmed extensively by several US agencies, inventoried in detail. \r\nGerman organization Todt OT had it named as Object 503 and it has document file number 624 with Operational Group VI.\r\n\r\nAustria, Melk near Roggendorf and Loosdorf. \r\nCodename: Quarz I and II B8 or Melk, Organisation Todt reference number OT Nr. 505 and 519 code named Esche II it was a large underground tunnel system for production of various machinery for German and Austrian military production. \r\n\r\nGermany, Nordhausen, Niedersachswerfen, Wolffleben, Harztor. \r\nCode name: Dora Mittlebau I, Ellrich Mittlebau II, Harzungen Mittlebau III, other codenames for this underground tunnel complex: Mittlebau, Mittelwerk, Anhydrit, Kaolin, Eber, Kuckuck I, Zinnstein, Nordwerk, Hydra I, Hydra II. \r\nHuge underground tunnel system, consisting of several systems and entrances. for production of V2 rockets, V1 rockets, Jet air planes and parts. and other manufacturing. The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945. It was extensively documented, photographed and video filmed, inventoried by all US and British intelligence and military intelligence, OSS, CIOS and ALSOS teams. Also congressional teams visited the site, and handed it over to Russian forces month later. after removing inventory and machinery, and documents. OT call names are: 5183, 518, 500. The location was handed over intact on orders of SS General Hans Kammler. none of this documentation have been released or declassified and I request this be done now. \r\n\r\nSeveral US CIOS reports on these subjects were released in part or not at all, these I also request in FULL unredacted, With ALL attached documents and photos.. the CIOS Report numbers requested are. XXXIII-38 and report number XXXII-17\r\n\r\nGermany, Jonastal, Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, Crawinkel, Codename SIII or Jonastal SIII. Huge underground tunnel system, underground, with several multi-stories underground bunkers and communication centrals. (AMT 800 and AMT 10) Also 25 unfinished tunnels were found in the Jonas Valley. However on the adjacent German proving ground  experimental test sites were found for Nuclear weapons. remains were found, witnesses interviewed and entrances to large underground facilities were found and investigated by US army personnel, later documented by various Intelligence agencies and military Intelligence, OSS and ALSOS teams. Including the FULL report of the ALSOS teams findings at the nearby and related Nuclear Reactor site at the school building in Stadt-Ilm under command of Scientist Kurt Dibner. and actively covered before handing over of the area to the Russian army. The area was liberated April 4 1945 by the US army (4th Armored and 89th ID). I request all documentation of what was found, documented, filmed, inventoried and removed from these locations. This location was also under the command of SS General Hans Kammler. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request all the above information which in short is all information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer  Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel factories and Jonastal SIII. Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance. I am requesting this to be released on behalf of history and the families involved, including the Kammler Family. \r\n\r\nIf you need further documentation or report references please contact me for these. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTino Struckmann\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe City of Los Angeles, and its Department of Building and Safety, entered into a settlement agreement with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, wherein the City would pay AHF approximately $100,000 and AHF would dismiss its cross-complaint against DBS in the case Antisdel et al v. AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Case No. 21STCV04049. City Attorney Ben Chapman ended up being the City Attorney handling the case after the retirement of Eskel Solomon, Esq.\r\n\r\nI request an unredacted copy of the settlement agreement as it is in the matter of public interest why the City paid a \"nonprofit\" with a broken elevator $100,000 to dismiss a complaint.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",
