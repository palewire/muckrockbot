Your FOIA Center reference number for tracking purposes is: N015952-080424 \r\nYou have requested the following records: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPer the CPS Comprehensive Policy on Attendance (Section 703.1, Board Report 22-0622-PO1), Section II, paragraph B (a):\r\n\r\n\"Schools must send a letter notifying a student\u2019s family of 5 unexcused absences, and, subsequently, 10 unexcused absences. 10 day letters of unexcused absence notification are to be sent certified, return receipt requested.\"\r\n\r\nIn FOIA N014933-022924, the District indicates, \"Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools.\"\r\n\r\n1. Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter;\r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter;\r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024;\r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency.\r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The photos I received from ATF are black-and-white scans and of relatively poor visual quality. I therefore request high-resolution, color copies of the same photos, plus any others associated with \"Deja Vu\" that were not released from the earlier request. \r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes.

Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/peter.fugiel/140788/2024-08-01_C169558_Fugiel-LEG_Seattle-Council-select-metadata.csv\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-council-219%252Fselect-secure-scheduling-council-emails-170805%252F%253Femail%253Dmuckrockseattle%252540mycusthelp.net&url_auth_token=AAAbJQToMIQHI1KMRcuzZrve4-c%3A1sZjGp%3AGHU1GXum0pus9tCKOc9CIy8O4-AZfCBLGClic8gMa1s\"",
