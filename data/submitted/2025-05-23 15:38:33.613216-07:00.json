I am not a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and my own request for records was denied on that basis. I understand that MuckRock may be able to assist by filing the request through a Virginia resident proxy.\r\n\r\nI am seeking public records related to the arrest of Melvin Jeter, who was taken into custody on April 7, 2025, in Chesterfield County, Virginia. According to publicly available information, Mr. Jeter was arrested for petit larceny and making a terrorist threat.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\n    The arrest report\r\n\r\n    The incident or offense report\r\n\r\n    Booking and charge information\r\n\r\n    Mugshot (if available)\r\n\r\n    Any court referral or charging documentation related to this arrest\r\n\r\nIf the request is too broad or requires narrowing, I am happy to provide additional information. I would prefer to receive the records electronically, if possible. Please also inform me if there are any fees associated with filing or processing this request.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your assistance in promoting access to public information. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Specific and unique terms or phrases are best or you can choose to use the + so that the first term/phrase + the second term/phrase must be in the email to be responsive (ie. \"PTSA Clubs Program\" + \"student safety\").The Department of Technology team is responsive to email/google chat pulls and all documents are reviewed to ensure that releasing them does not violate any federal or state law. \r\n**Note the district can search by groups of people (ie. HR department or legal department) but your request involves a 100+ employees. I would expect on average to each of them to conduct a search of their files for responsive documents on average would take 10 minutes (some shorter and some much longer). My recommendation would be to focus your request on those who you know have records responsive to your request and you can always submit a new request based on the documents you receive and review. Respond to this email with the details requested above. Upon receipt of clarification, the Denver Public Schools (DPS) will further respond to your public records request as required by law.\u00a0 If clarification is not received within 15 business days from the date of this email, this request will be closed.
