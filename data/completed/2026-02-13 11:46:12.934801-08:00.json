Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public greater than the public\u2019s general interest in Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2026-ICFO-08352. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Pursuant to General Provisions \u00a7 4-203(b)(2), if it will take more than 10 working days to produce the requested records, we must be notified, in writing or by email, of that fact. If the records are not able to be produced within 10 days, you may request an extension up to thirty (30) days.  If access to any or all records described above is denied, please identify in a written statement the general content of each item being withheld. Additionally, \u00a7 4-203 (a) and (c) of the General Provisions Article requires you to provide in writing grounds for denial, citing legal authority under which you may deny access.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.  Alternatively, please consider waiving any fees, pursuant to \u00a7 4-206(e)(2)(ii) of the General Provisions Article, as this request is on behalf of individuals served by the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, a state government agency, which solely serves indigent citizens of Maryland.  As a result, my request for the above-listed public records is in the public interest.  I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDeborah Levi\r\nDirector of Special Litigation\r\nMaryland Office of the Public Defender\r\n(443) 272-1068",

For example, $40.00, 2014; which would mean that that license would cost $40 from whatever the first date that I have recorded until the 2014, that license was $40. If the Year End column shows 9999, then that was the last, or current price, that we have.\r\n\r\nThere is also Last Year Sold and a First Year Recorded columns, since some of these licenses are no longer available, this should help you with the ranges of prices.\r\n\r\nThe Old Fee listed is the fee that was charged until 7/1/2023. This is when we  switched over to a hosting contractor. Some licenses didn't have a fee. The New Fee started on 7/1/2023. I don't know how you wanted to break the data down, but for the new fee there is the fee that the agent makes and a transaction fee associated with the license / permit. If the selling agent is WRC or the hosting contractor, then the agent gets $3 and the transaction fee is $2. If it is any other agent, then the agent gets $4 and the transaction fee is $1.\r\n\r\nThere is a separate tab for the reciprocal pricing. Any state that isn't listed on that tab pays the same amount as the NC fee.\r\n\r\nI hope this satisfies your request. If there is anything you need clarified or changed, please let me know.\n",

Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; photographs; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"How Did They Fix That?,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nSeason 4 of \"How Did They Fix That?\" appears on a list of DoD entertainment industry collaborations released to me through FOIA. The list is attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Please be advised, the last part of the use of force data report contains juvenile information, which will need to be redacted. While we expect to be able to provide it in October, there are thousands of lines of data within the report and each case will need to be reviewed in order for us to determine which pieces of information fall under juvenile exemptions, so we may need more time.

Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. \r\nIf you believe the information furnished has been incorrectly redacted or is incomplete, please reach out to the assigned staff by replying to this message.

Anything below will not be viewable to staff. --- \r\n02/10/2026 P004584-073025 Samuel Sinyangwe, \r\nThe final installment of records responsive to your request are now available via the City of Bellevue Public Records Portal website.\u00a0Pop-ups may need to be enabled on your internet browser to access your files for download. This concludes our search of records in the custody of the Bellevue Police Department. This is our final, definitive response and your request is closed.\u00a0 As the city does not intend to further address the request, the Public Records Act one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has now started to run. Pursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. Please be advised, you may file a written appeal if you believe information has been incorrectly redacted or records have been incorrectly withheld. The appeal must include your name and address, a copy of the redacted document and a copy of this letter together with a brief statement identifying the basis of the appeal. Please mail your appeal to: Bellevue Police Department \r\nAttn: Records Supervisor \r\nP.O. Box 90012 \r\nBellevue, WA\u00a0 98009-9012 If you require any further assistance from the Bellevue Police Department regarding this matter or have questions, please contact the Records Unit via the Public Records Portal or by telephone at (425) 452-6917 within 30 days of this notification. Thank you, Jessica Abbott \r\nBellevue Police Department \r\nRPC 4.4 Inadvertent Disclosure Notification: CR 26 (b) (6) Claw Back Provision *** Please read this notice carefully *** Dear legal practitioner: Please take notice that we take reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of privileged or confidential materials, including those protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine, when responding to request for records.\u00a0 These precautions include, but are not limited to, carefully locating and assembling responsive records, performing an intra-departmental review of the records for purposes of determining whether they contain any privileged or confidential materials, forwarding the records to the County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for independent legal review, meeting and conferring with the Prosecuting Attorney's Office to compare and reconcile any conflicting results of our separate independent reviews and, if necessary, creating a withholding log.\u00a0 Despite our having taken these precautions, occasionally a mistake is made and privileged or confidential documents are inadvertently produced.\u00a0 To that end, we wanted to notify you that there is a possibility that the records being produced may contain privileged or confidential materials.\u00a0 The inadvertent or unintentional production of privileged or confidential documents, without a privileged or confidentiality designation should not be considered a waiver in whole or in part of any claim of privileged or confidential treatment, and any document that initially is produced without bearing a privileged or confidentiality designation may later be so designated.\u00a0 In the event that you believe you have received privileged or confidential materials, we would ask that you promptly notify us of this fact and take action as necessary to comply with the obligations set forth in Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4 and/or Civil Rule 26 (b)(6).",

        "communication": "Dear SB1421 Requesters and interested parties,\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the City of Fullerton has broken California\u2019s Public Record\u2019s Law, specifically related to SB1421, by denying you records which are quite clearly publicly disclosable.\r\n\r\nIn the link sent to you by Mea Klein, Assistant City Clerk, as provided to her by the City Attorney, you were told that there are 27 Officers \"REQUESTED BY NAME, BUT NO DISCLOSABLE FILE AVAILABLE (27)\u201d. This is patently false.\r\n\r\nThe City of Fullerton is currently suing me, my compatriot David and the blog Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future directly related to the findings on several of these officers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/>\r\n\r\nIn looking at this list I can quite easily name Officers on that list who have disclosable records under SB1421 including but not limited to Kathryn Hamel, Paul Irish, Miguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo, Christopher Wren & Nathan Roesler.\r\n\r\nA sustained finding was found against Hamel and one cannot simply unring that bell as seen in the recent Contra Costa County tentative decision (CASE NAME: RICHMOND POLICE VS. CITY OF RICHMOND <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Contra-Costa-Ruling-Case-MSN19-0169-2020-07-31.pdf>). \r\n\r\nThis FFFF article related to Hamel is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/>\r\n\r\nChristopher Wren had a sustained finding against for dishonesty related to a workplace affair with a subordinate. In IA Case #17-0038 one of the sustained findings against Officer Wren is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201c6. On December 17, 2017, when Lieutenant Cleggett asked you about your whereabouts, you dishonestly stated to Lieutenant Cleggett that you had been on the phone with your wife the entire time and did not notice Lieutenant Cleggett\u2019s text message.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement of dishonesty was directly related to misconduct as outlined in the timeline of Wren\u2019s activities and being in violation of policy. \r\n\r\nLikewise with Christopher Wren, this article is specifically listed in the lawsuit being waged against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/what-happened-to-officer-christopher-wren/\r\n\r\nThe idea that the city attorney is unaware of the sustained findings against their officers which are disclosable under SB1421 is laughable when those very stories are being used by the same attorneys as evidence in a lawsuit where the city seeks a prior restraint against myself and FFFF.\r\n\r\nThe blog has likewise published stories on how Paul Irish was terminated for dishonesty;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/>\r\n\r\nMiguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo admitted in the plea deal that he both used excessive force and falsified a police report.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/>\r\n\r\nNathan Roesler filed a false report with the City of Placentia which resulted in an innocent man being arrested for a crime that wasn\u2019t committed against Roesler. This was referred to the District Attorney for prosecution.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/>\r\n\r\nThese are the cases which are readily and easily pointed out which I believe to be disclosable under SB1421 which calls all of the other officers on the list into question. The City is blatantly lying to you, your organizations and agencies as well as the public and concerned entities about disclosable records despite being in a separate lawsuit over these very violations of SB1421.\r\n\r\nThey are likewise violating the law in regards to the officer whose records are \"PENDING; NOT YET PRODUCED (3)\u201d. The incident in Corbett\u2019s case was from 2016 and Paez\u2019s was in 2017. The timeline has long passed for required production in both of these cases.\r\n\r\nIf you are honestly seeking these records and others from the City of Fullerton you will likely have no recourse but to seek remedies in order to get to the truth. I have already been forced to take this route unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I wish you all the best in your efforts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Ferguson\r\nHost, The Hourly Struggle\r\nWriter, Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future\r\nConcerned Citizen\n",

        "communication": "Dear SB 1421 requesters and interested parties:\r\nYou have each recently received a mass email communication from an individual with whom the City of Fullerton is currently engaged in civil litigation, Joshua Ferguson.  The email contained inaccuracies about the City's responses to Public Records requests.  The City would like to correct certain information and assure you and other members of the public of its commitment to transparency and compliance with legal requirements for the disclosure of public records, including certain peace officer records recently made public under SB 1421, which is codified at Penal Code section 832.7.  Of course, the City cannot respond as to any specifics about any individual officers referenced, due to privacy.\r\n\r\nDisclosable use of force files:\r\nNot all use of force investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of those files involving uses of force that have resulted in death or \"great bodily injury.\"  Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \"Great bodily injury\" means \"significant or substantial physical injury.\"  Pen. Code section 16600.  Examples of \"great bodily injury\" include: broken bones, People v. Villarreal (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1141; gunshot wounds, People v. Mendias (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 195; and a dog bite, People v. Frazier (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 613, 618.  SB 1421 also mandates the disclosure of investigation files involving a peace officer or custodial officer's discharge of a firearm at a civilian.  See Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nDisclosable dishonesty files:\r\nNot all dishonesty investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of \"sustained finding[s] . . . [of] dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.\"  See Cal. Penal Code section 832.7(b)(1)(C) (emphasis added).\r\nThe Legislature intended to provide the public access to cases involving dishonesty, where an officer \"is proven to have planted evidence, committed perjury, or otherwise been dishonest in the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime.\"  Assembly Committee on Public Safety, Analysis of SB 1421 (June 26, 2018).\r\n\r\nIn order for acts of dishonesty to be disclosable under SB 1421, there must also have been a \"sustained\" finding of dishonesty.  A \"sustained finding\" is defined as \"a final determination by an investigating agency, commission, board, hearing officer, or arbitrator, as applicable, following an investigation and opportunity for an administrative appeal pursuant to Sections 3304 and 3304.5 of the Government Code, that the actions of the peace officer or custodial officer were found to violate law or department policy.\"  Pen. Code section 832.8 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIf an officer investigated for the type dishonesty or sexual assault that is disclosable under SB 1421 resigns prior to a sustained finding, his or her file is not disclosable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the email that you received referred to a specific court ruling (Richmond Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of Richmond), that ruling was only tentative (not final) and was only the ruling of one Superior Court Judge in Contra Costa County.  The City of Fullerton is located in Orange County, and is not subject to those courts or their rulings.  However, even a ruling in Orange County would not have been determinative, as facts in different cases may lead to different results, and a single judge's opinion is not required to be followed by other judges, until there is some binding opinion of higher courts.  In fact, in City of Richmond, that court found that the employer and an officer could not reverse sustained findings of dishonesty or sexual assault through a negotiated settlement, after the conclusion of a formal hearing process.  In circumstances where a final, formal hearing has not been held, the court acknowledged that there would be no \"sustained findings\" and hence such records are \"not disclosable under SB 1421.\"  (The City of Richmond court also noted that investigations of dishonesty involving subjects not specifically listed in Penal Code section 832.7 are also not disclosable).\r\n\r\nRegardless of the inapplicability of the City of Richmond opinion in Orange County, the City of Fullerton's disclosure of its records under SB 1421 does follow the same principles.\r\n\r\nThe City is committed to providing all records that it is required and permitted to release to the public relating to peace officers.  It has been working hard to review and release all records newly made releasable since the enactment of SB 1421, and will continue to do so. The City has produced 26 SB 1421 files; has partially produced 13 additional SB 1421 files; and has 2 SB 1421 files pending review (one of which awaits resolution of administrative or other proceedings).  The City's SB 1421 productions are available at www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421<http://www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421>, and a copy of the summary chart detailing the progress of the City's SB 1421 review and production is posted therein.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your requests or the City's production thereto, please contact the City Clerk's Office or the City Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nKimberly Hall Barlow\r\nJones & Mayer\r\n3777 N.

However, it cannot be processed for the following reason(s):\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Request is overly broad (overbreadth issues).\r\n\r\nUnder longstanding FOIA precedents, \u201cbroad sweeping requests lacking specificity are not permissible.\u201d Marks v. United States (Dep\u2019t of Justice), 578 F.2d 261, 263 (9 Cir. 1978), see also, (\u201cRequest is too broad which seeks \u2018all unpublished manuscripts decisions of the Patent Office, together with such indices as are available.\u201d Irons v. Schuyler, 151 U.S App. D.C 23(1972)). See also, OSTP\u2019s regulation that reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OSTP personnel to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, a requester should include specific information that may assist OSTP personnel in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. In general, a requester should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought. 32 C.F.R.\u00a72402.4(b).\r\n\r\nThus, the request needs to be amended to identify the custodian(s) for the records mentioned herein. For instance, the request could be amended as follows:\r\n\r\nAll communications to or from OSTP\u2019s former Director, Dr. Arati Prabhakar, and current Director, Michael Kratisios, regarding\r\n\r\n\u201c- a)The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)\r\n- b)The SCREEN Act\r\n- c)Any U.S. age verification or online child safety policy proposals.\u201d\r\n\r\n- a)National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE)\r\n- b)Collective Shout\r\n- c)CEASE (Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation)\r\n- d)Carnegie UK Trust\r\n- e)Yoti (digital ID software provider)\r\n\r\n\r\n- a)The Online Safety Act (UK)\r\n- b)The Digital Services Act (DSA) (EU)\r\n- c)Impacts on U.S. tech companies or policymaking.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe responsive timeframe is January 1, 2022, to the present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the request could be amended as follows:\r\n\r\nAll communications between OSTP\u2019s former Director, Dr. Arati Prabhakar, and current Director, Michael Kratisios, and Ofcom and the European Commission regarding\r\n\r\na)The Online Safety Act (UK)\r\n- b)The Digital Services Act (DSA) (EU)\r\n- c)Impacts on U.S. tech companies or policymaking\r\n\r\nThe responsive timeframe is January 1, 2022, to the present.\r\n\r\nThose are examples of permissible requests.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA Office.",
