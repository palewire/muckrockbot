        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7.

The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

Kitovani was born on the 9th of June 1938 in the then Soviet city of Tbilisi and died on the 13th of November 2023. The death of Kitovani was widely reported and a copy of a Radio Free Europe report about his death is attached. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Tengiz Kitovani from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices,  legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Tengiz Kitovani. Please conduct a search for records related to Tengiz Kitovani and the 1991\u20131992 Georgian coup d'\u00e9tat. \r\n\r\nFollowing the civil war, Kitovani was in Moscow and then returned to Georgian in 2014. His presence was not welcomed, and he likely generated discussion by the bureau. Please also search for any written correspondence between Kiotvani and any member of bureau leadership. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Tengiz Kitovani. \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Flickinger, special agent for the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, during the period of 1975 through 1985. Special Agent Flickinger was tasked with investigating the claims of a convict name A. Kenneth Bankston who was serving time in Leavenworth Prison in Kansas for bank robbery. Bankston specifically claimed that a group named the \"Sons of Satan\" was perpetrating the cattle mutilations occurring in the Midwest during that period. Bankston originally contacted Ross Doyen, a Kansas state senator, with these claims. Additionally, a man named Jerome Clark began corresponding with Senator Doyen and Bankston about the claims that such a group existed. Bankston subsequently claimed that this group was also associated with individuals involved in the bombing of the \"Sterling Hall\" Army mathematics lab at the University of Wisconsin in 1970; the theft of plutonium related to the \"Karen Silkwood\" case in 1974; and that the group maintained a list of US politicians that they planned to assassinate. Federal and state law enforcement took Bankston's claims serious enough that Special Agent Flickinger corresponded with the United States District Attorney's Office in Minneapolis, Federal Judge Myles Lord, and the Warden at the Marion Penitentiary in 1975 to transfer Bankston to a minimal security facility. Special Agent Flickinger subsequently spent the next few months in 1975 officially investigating Bankston's claims. We request copies of all files and correspondence related to Donald E. Flickinger's investigation into the claims of A. Kenneth Bankston, and/or the \"Sons of Satan\" (or any other groups associated with Flickinger's investigation into Bankston's claims). We additionally request copies of all correspondence between Special Agent Flickinger,  J.

He was born on 6 November 1949 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He died on 14 November 2023.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\nMr. Ahearn was a Republican White House official, political consultant, executive branch appointee, and campaigner. He worked for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Steve Forbes, Rudy Giuliani, and Donald Trump, as well as for several Vice Presidents. He served as the lead \"advanceman\" for President Ronald Wilson Reagan, and he was present at John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt on the President's life. Ahearn worked as regional representative of the U.S. Secretary of Labor, Raymond Donovan. He was also a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ahearn served as a campaign manager for a Ukrainian pro-Russian political party, the Party of Regions, in 2006. \r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Brown appeared in numerous national media, including NPR, https://www.npr.org/2023/05/19/1118051361/nfl-hall-of-fame-cleveland-browns-running-back-jim-brown-dead, the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/sports/football/im-brown-dead.html, and ESPN (see attached).\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Ahearn:\r\n\r\n(1) Ronald Wilson Reagan\r\n(2) John Hinckley Jr.\r\n(3) Party of Regions (Ukraine)\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn was a public figure. He was a key figure in Republican presidential politics for over half a century, and he was present at one of the most dire moments of the Reagan presidency, when the President was shot by John Hinckley Jr. Thus, a broad segment of the public will likely be interested in these records.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am requesting more detailed data at more frequent intervals than is published here: https://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Download/Default.aspx. \r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.
