        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA) has communicated, albeit without specific legal citations, that \"In 1945, the expenditure of public funds payable as dues to the Association was given a legal foundation in Education Law by the state Legislature.\" In light of this statement, I am seeking access to records under the New York State Freedom of Information Law that could provide clarification and documentation of this legal foundation. My request includes:\r\n\r\n-Legislative Documents: I am requesting copies of legislative documents, memoranda, or official notices from around 1945 that detail the authorization for school districts to use public funds for NYSSBA membership dues. This includes any legislative acts or amendments specifically enabling such expenditures.\r\n\r\n-Official Correspondence: I seek any official correspondence between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and NYSSBA, dating from 1945 to the current day, which discusses or references the legal basis for using public funds for NYSSBA dues.\r\n\r\n-Policy Documents: I am interested in obtaining any policy documents, guidelines, or bulletins issued by NYSED that address or relate to the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\nI recognize the importance of making my request specific and actionable. This request is aimed at accessing existing, identifiable records without requiring your department to undertake legal interpretation or generate new documentation.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the timeframe specified in my request, spanning from 1945 to the present, may present a broad scope that could potentially place an undue burden on your department. Therefore, I would like to emphasize my openness to partial responses. If locating documents from the entire period specified proves to be overly burdensome, I kindly request that the department prioritize the search and provision of documents from the following more focused timeframes, in order of importance:\r\n\r\n-Documents from the year 1945/1946 itself, given its specific mention in the context of providing legal foundation for school districts' expenditures on NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\n-Key documents from significant legislative or policy milestones related to this matter, should they be readily identifiable by your department.\r\n\r\nThis approach is intended to balance the need for thoroughness with practical considerations regarding the volume of records and the effort required to retrieve them. My goal is to facilitate a manageable and effective search process that aligns with both our interests in accessing relevant public records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if during the process of fulfilling this request, specific documents are identified that would substantially respond to the core of my inquiry, I am amenable to narrowing the scope further based on your suggestions. Your expertise and understanding of the department's records could provide valuable guidance in focusing this request more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Specifically, you request copies of any records that \"could provide clarification and documentation\" of the statute, including legislative documents, policy documents, and official correspondence.\r\n\r\nA diligent search was made for records responsive to your request, and the following records were located and copied:\r\n\r\n[1.] Governor's \"bill jacket\" for Laws of 1945, Chapter 92 (in State Archives record series 12950), which enacted what is now Education Law sect. 1618. The bill jacket contains a copy of the bill that was enacted, as well as comments on the bill. The jacket has been scanned, and a link to the digital file will be transmitted to you in a separate e-mail.\r\n\r\n[2.] Legal opinions of the Commissioner of Education relating to sect. 1618, found in 1 Education Department Reports 718 and 5 Education Department Reports 232. Digital copies of those published opinions are attached.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that after a diligent search, no \"policy documents\" or \"official correspondence\" concerning sect. 1618 were found in the correspondence and subject files of the Commissioner of Education that have been transferred to the State Archives by the State Education Department. Under my direction, staff searched the Commissioner's correspondence and subject files dating from 1945 through 2014, and no documents responsive to your request were located. More recent subject and correspondence files have not been transferred to the Archives.\r\n\r\nBecause no policy documents or official correspondence were located, you may appeal this partial denial of your request by sending a letter within thirty (30) days to Dr. Betty Rosa, Commissioner of Education, New York State Education Department, 89 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12234.

Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

Currently, your request is in the review stage. \nTreasury Departmental Offices processes FOIA requests in a multi-track system, which identifies a request as simple or complex, and generally processes each request on a first-in, first-out basis.

Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request within 90 to 120 days.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \nSorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience. \n\nSincerely, \nReNay Royster ReNay.Royster@treasury.gov FOIA@treasury.gov\n",

Currently, your request is in the queue for review. \nTreasury Departmental Offices processes FOIA requests in a multi-track system, which identifies a request as simple or complex, and generally processes each request on a first-in, first-out basis.  Your request is considered complex.  During the last fiscal year, complex requests were processed on average within 347 business days.  Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request by July 8, 2024.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \n \nThank you, \nReNay Royster ReNay.Royster@treasury.gov FOIA@treasury.gov\n",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets.

Please include responses to these emails as well. I can further limit the scope of the request to only be for the last year.  Unfortunately I am unclear exactly who at the department would be sending the aforementioned notification reports, so I cannot limit the scope of the employee inboxes that need to be searched beyond excluding patrol officers and HR.  Again, I''d be happy to discuss this over the phone to better target the request and assist the department in a search for responsive records. Don't hesitate to call me at 8053383408 ",

These are reports where personnel have reached out to Shotspotter for support, because the system failed to detect a shooting or misclassified an incident. According to ShotSpotter, their best practices include steps to ensure that if police officers conclude the ShotSpotter alert was indeed a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d they report that the company to \"keep track and take remedial steps to minimize false positives in the future\". I am looking for any such feedback given to ShotSpotter. \r\n\r\n- Any emails between department staff with the words \"false positive\" and \"Shotspotter\" or \"shot spotter\" or \"sound thinking\". Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed. \r\n\r\n- Copies of all SoundThinking (Shotspotter) responses to aforementioned notification reports, Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed. \r\nThe City has located records responsive to your request.\u00a0 You can log into the system by clicking the following link and download your responsive records. \r\nPolice Public Records Request - P141315-103023\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience while we worked through this.\u00a0 Your\u00a0request will now be closed. \r\n\r\nRecords Section \r\nCincinnati Police Department",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: or any other emails corresponding to this individual including jaromeg@earthlink.com, .\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2000 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

All email discussions between Teri Paul, using any email, but specifically carpenter81321@protonmail.com and sundog2014@yahoo.com, and Lance McDaniel which may be cc'd or include other city employees.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2021 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. Please provide each deliverable 1-5, or itemize and concatenate as per the request order for pricing and delivery.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. Please provide this metadata and note that no per-page fee should be levied.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to Duane Ramsdell \"Dewey\" Clarridge (April 16, 1932 \u2013 April 9, 2016), who was a senior operations officer for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and supervisor for more than 30 years. Clarridge was the chief of the Latin American division from 1981 to 1987 and a key figure in the Iran-Contra Affair. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/us/duane-r-clarridge-brash-spy-who-fought-terror-dies-at-83.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nFOIA case law establishes the extent to which agencies MUST search all records system reasonably believed to contain responsive documents, even if it means contacting former employees. Truitt v. Department of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990) makes it explicitly clear that it is the obligation of the Department to \u201cconduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\u201d In addition, the Justice Department\u2019s May 2004 FOIA Guide states that an agency \u201ccannot limit its search to only one record system if there are others that are likely to turn up the information requested.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: matthewkeefauver@aim.com or mkeefauver@cortezco.gov or any other emails corresponding to this individual.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2000 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Anna Chennault, born Chan Sheng Mai later spelt Chen Xiangmei (\u9673\u9999\u6885, actual birth year 1923 but reported as June 23, 1925 \u2013 March 30, 2018), also known as Anna Chan Chennault or Anna Chen Chennault, was a war correspondent and prominent Republican member of the US China Lobby. After her husband's death, Anna Chennault worked as a publicist for the Civil Air Transport in Taipei, Taiwan (1946\u20131957) and was vice-president of international affairs for the Flying Tiger Line that was founded by a former Flying Tiger pilot, and was president of TAC International (from 1976). In 1960, Chennault had her first political experience when she campaigned for Richard Nixon, being used as the Republican principal campaigner among Chinese-Americans. She was an occasional correspondent for the Central News Agency (from 1965) and the US correspondent for the Hsin Shen Daily News (from 1958). She was a broadcaster for the Voice of America from 1963 to 1966.  Cartha \"Deke\" DeLoach, then FBI Deputy Director, mentioned in his book Hoover's FBI that his agency was able to connect a single November 2, 1968 phone call from the then Vice President candidate Spiro Agnew to Anna Chennault, unrecorded details of which Johnson believed were subsequently transmitted to Nixon.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).

DCYF will also be working closely with the Department of Health which provides oversight for the behavioral and substance treatment centers to provide them with information about CPS investigations at these locations.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about reporting suspected child abuse or neglect, visit https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/safety/report-abuse.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

That support level would increase based on additional needs of the child, including support for adolescents, chronic physical health, developmental disabilities, and mental health.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Caregiver Support Rates chart [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2023/12/28/file_attachments/2731309/Caregiver%20Supports%20Rates.pdf ] \r\n\r\n\"We know that caregivers who have children and youth with higher needs, need more support to care for them,\" said DCYF Secretary Ross Hunter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, DCYF is changing its rate assessment process. DCYF will begin to use the child\u2019s case file, information gathered from the child, parents, family, and other important individuals in the child\u2019s life, and health history information to determine support level.\r\n\r\nIf a caregiver believes information about the child's needs was not considered in a level determination, they have the opportunity to appeal. Caregivers can request rate determination review any time there is a change in circumstances or a new diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\"The new process will help us identify\u00a0a child\u2019s needs and help us link caregivers to the supports that are best suited for the child in their care,\" explained Hunter. \"By better preparing\u00a0caregivers to support children and youth placed in their care, we should see an increase in placement stability.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\nDCYF has removed barriers for kinship caregivers to become licensed to care for the children in their home. If they have an approved home study, kin most likely already meet the requirements for a kinship license. Once licensed, the children in their care are eligible to receive monthly foster care maintenance payments to assist in meeting their needs.\r\n\r\nLastly, caregivers licensed by child placing agencies will begin to be paid directly by DCYF.\u00a0The new caregiver supports model marks the first time the rates and process have undergone major changes in over two decades.\u00a0The change is part of a larger project aimed at implementing a continuum of placement resources that enable safe, stable, and supported placements for children in the care of DCYF.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo learn more about DCYF's Caregiver Supports project, visit:\u00a0*https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project* [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project ].\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

It is likewise a serious barrier to reunifying children with their parents,\" Washington State Court Administrator Dawn Marie Rubio said at the signing ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Office of the Courts played a critical role to bring all three branches of government together to come to this agreement.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOver the years, there has been a lack of capacity in parts of the state, but through this partnership, DCYF and public housing authority and non-profits will now be able to serve more youth and families with housing statewide. Eligible families and youth will receive referrals from their DCYF caseworker to a contracted provider who will help them locate housing that accepts vouchers.\r\n\r\nMichael Mirra, retired executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority and co-chair of the Housing and Child Welfare Subcommittee, said the agreement will imbed housing into the child welfare system. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will spare children and families from the trauma of avoidable out-of-home placement, it will house teenagers coming from foster care or juvenile rehabilitation who would otherwise start their independent adulthood by becoming homeless, it will help the state\u2019s child welfare workers perform what may be the hardest job in public service; and it will save the state money in averted foster care costs,\u201d he explained.\r\n\r\nLowel Krueger, executive director of the Yakima Housing Authority said folks from the Association of Washington Housing Authorities were grateful for all of the partners who \"persisted in establishing this innovative collaboration to provide families involved in the child welfare system with housing, a critical first step in helping families and changing life outcomes for children.\"\r\n\r\nDCYF\u2019s ability to begin to provide the contracted Housing Supportive Services that are necessary to fulfill its commitment to HUD was made possible through $8 million in investments from the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited to sign this historic document with all the partnerships and what it means for the families we serve,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cWhen our youth and families are supported, they thrive, preventing deeper penetration into the child welfare system.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter with folks from the Housing Authorities photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787090/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20with%20folks%20from%20the%20Housing%20Authorities.jpg ]\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter Signing MOU photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787091/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20Signing%20MOU.jpg ]\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:*\r\n\r\nNancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

Deloitte maintains several systems for the Department.  Each is maintained differently both externally and internally.  Furthermore, there is no official \u201cchange request\u201d procedure that covers all systems maintained by Deloitte.  Is there a specific system (i.e. ACCESS; CCWIS) that you are looking at?  Knowing this would assist in our search for the records.  Let me know so we can continue our search and develop an accurate cost estimate (if one is needed).\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\nJohn M.

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989):** Underscoring the need for a functional analysis of the requested documents, focusing on the nature and content of the information rather than the identity of the parties involved.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease be aware of your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

I would prefer to receive these records as an electronic spreadsheet (.xlsx or .csv file) with separate rows for each email and separate columns for each attribute. \r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel \r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow \r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-council-219%252Fsecure-scheduling-council-email-metadata-158137%252F%253Femail%253Dmuckrockseattle%252540mycusthelp.net&url_auth_token=AAAbJQToMIQHI1KMRcuzZrve4-c%3A1rVkzT%3AQsSPbNPrN_hswrQRlWpGHoB4lmk2FdSYAR2MjWjJO3Q \r\nThe records being made available to you at this time is the metadata spreadsheet we discussed.

Based on our discussion, it is my understanding that this will satisfy your request, and that it may not have a couple of the field/columns that you called out. Please let me know if this is not your understanding. With this, I am closing your request. \r\nTo download your records, please: \r\n \r\n  * Navigate to the Public Records Request Center. \r\n  * Select 'My Records Request Center'. \r\n  * Select 'View My Requests'.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Miranda,\r\n\r\nThank you for your letter dated October 30. I recognize the need to weigh the burden of fulfilling the request against the public interest in the information. I am surprised that your search returned 3,710 pages of responsive records. That figure is 7 times greater than the number of pages returned by a similar search conducted by the Mayor's Office (509 pages) and 9 times greater than the responsive records returned by the City Council Committee on Workforce Development (392 pages). \r\n\r\nBefore I narrow my request, could you please confirm that your office conducted a search for the exact, compound phrases \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\", or \"fair scheduling\"? If the initial search did not use quotation marks or Boolean operators to filter out partial matches containing only one key word (e.g. \"scheduling\"), it likely returned many irrelevant results. For example, a Google search of the key words (fair workweek fair scheduling) without quotation marks yields more than 5.5 million results (https://www.google.com/search?q=fair+scheduling+fair+workweek). By contrast, enclosing the relevant phrases in quotation marks (\"fair workweek\" \"fair scheduling\") yields only 1,390 results (https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fair+scheduling%22+%22fair+workweek%22). \r\n\r\nI appreciate your offer to share an index of the emails. Assuming the index includes the date of each email, it would shed light on the relevance of the initial search results. Most of the public discussion and legislative action around the Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance occurred between June 2018 and July 2019 with a peak around June or July 2019. The date distribution of search results should reflect this, with relatively few results from earlier in 2018 or later in 2019. If that is not the case in your initial search, it likely contains irrelevant results that can be filtered out through more precise specification of the search parameters.\r\n\r\nIf the initial search was conducted using the exact parameters requested, then I would be willing to narrow my request. I am most interested in emails and attachments sent or received by Aldermen John Arena, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, and Tom Tunney, since they were not included in the records previously provided to me. According to my list (Aldermanic_addresses_to_search.xlsx), there are 18 email addresses or aliases associated with these 3 Aldermen. To be clear, I am requesting all emails and attachments sent or received during the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019 by Aldermen John Arena, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, or Tom Tunney that contain one or more of the non-case-sensitive, compound phrases \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\", or \"fair scheduling.\" \r\n\r\nAs you review my request, I ask that you take into account the considerable public interest in this information. The Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance establishes the most expansive set of working time regulations since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. While similar scheduling legislation has passed in a dozen other cities, Chicago is the only jurisdiction in the country to cover manufacturing, warehouse, and health care as well as retail and hospitality workers with comparable protections. My assessment of the public interest in this matter is informed by my expertise as an academic researcher who specializes in labor standards and scheduling practices. I have requested these records as part of the first systematic study of scheduling legislation, a project in which the National Science Foundation found sufficient intellectual merit and public interest to award me a competitive Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (#2203815).\r\n\r\nI look forward to your clarification of the initial search results and continued assistance with my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel, PhD",

Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.) on December 17, 2022. \n\nThe Department is initiating a search for records responsive to your request and will make available for inspection or provide copies of all responsive records, if any, that it is able to locate through reasonable efforts and that are not privileged or exempt from disclosure pursuant to the PRA or other applicable law. The Department will seek to make such records available as soon as reasonably possible. In the event the Department will be unable to make the records available within 90 days of your initial request, we will contact you to discuss the matter. \n\nThe PRA requires disclosure of existing records in the possession, custody, or control of a public agency. If the Department locates existing records responsive to your request, Department staff will assemble the disclosable records. You may elect to receive copies of the records or to inspect them in person: \n \n  * If you chose to receive copies electronically, documents maintained in electronic format will be transmitted electronically whenever possible through the PRA Records Center. \n  * If the Department needs to deliver hard copies, you will be charged a copying fee of $.15 per page. The Department will notify you of the total cost prior to mailing the records. Please note the Department cannot waive or reduce these fees and costs for any reason.\u00a0 Once staff are able to return to their offices to make and send the copies, they will be sent to you. \n  * If you chose to inspect the records in person, you will be notified of the availability of the records for inspection. \nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please contact us and reference PRA No. R005993-121922.\u00a0 You may also call (916) 654-3821. \n\nSincerely, \n\nLacy Bauer \n\nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Public Records Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6HtRfOYLt5fXvpttM-2FU1HZPEhFU-2Bvy2oqrlHBe5M0RGAeT-2B4qUykOWV59A9EEIaMPR3Z61l1qOuhakTThE-2F77Z5F1t1TcgerLoFymh-2FS3eHKUPDgpIT9msrJlkj2-2FcFMQf4B_jdd-2FkHGaRoBK3G4V2uO0vDbhYgkiU4-2B1YD8HTfIqczN55dF3mSU410DOqyTYAD4gF6i8BnQQGcZmYaua-2FJTGomeZaZT92VrODt31-2BkV3BTtdiA2rLWvqMWgNlJHxVDOedpO6nP1e4uaWAoQetVi-2Fu20KssisrWKwK1GWLTmJx1iuDhr4-2BK4fg85r-2FeIFyzr908koPXgTHbSTRx9WLHlIlkM8rVj-2B5dnhAodBgIJPcjg-3D)\n",
