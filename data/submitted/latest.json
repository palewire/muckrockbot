Online:  https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/welfare-and-institutions-code/wic-sect-851-1/), a 2018 law that requires juvenile detention facilities to provide youth in custody with internet access.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this law establishes the following requirements for juvenile detention facilities: \r\n\r\n\u201cMinors detained in or committed to a juvenile hall shall be provided with access to computer technology and the Internet for the purposes of education.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe law also allows juvenile halls to provide access to computers and the internet for \u201cmaintaining relationships with family.\u201d The Chief Probation Officer, or their designee, may \u201climit or deny access to computer technology or the Internet for safety and security or staffing reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe request the following Yuba County Probation Department records: \r\n\r\n1. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for maintaining familial relationships; \r\n3. All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5. All procurement records, such as RFPs, RFIs, solicitations, successful bids, and contracts/agreements with vendors for technology systems to provide minors in juvenile hall with access to computing and internet-connected technology; \r\n6. Examples of any consent, permission, and similar documents provided to parents and guardians of minors in juvenile hall related to access to computer technology and the internet;\r\n7. Any quarterly, annual, or other periodic reports that summarize the implementation of programs to comply with AB 2448 generated since 2018;\r\n8. Logs, records, or orders related to suspension of internet access, for any amount of time, \u201cfor safety and security or staffing reasons\u201d since 2018; and\r\n9. Aggregate data on the number of juvenile users of computer technology and internet systems for the period 2022 and 2023.\r\n\r\nShould these records not exist, we would appreciate a statement as to whether the agency is in compliance with AB 2448. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n- Assistance in identifying additional records and information that will assist us in understanding the state of the agency\u2019s compliance with AB 2448;\r\n- A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n- Suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $50.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $50.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the Muckrock.com email above or my direct email, dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy St. San Francisco, CA, 94109, or leave a voicemail message at 415-436-9333 x151.                                          \r\nSincerely,\r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Online:  https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/welfare-and-institutions-code/wic-sect-851-1/), a 2018 law that requires juvenile detention facilities to provide youth in custody with internet access.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this law establishes the following requirements for juvenile detention facilities: \r\n\r\n\u201cMinors detained in or committed to a juvenile hall shall be provided with access to computer technology and the Internet for the purposes of education.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe law also allows juvenile halls to provide access to computers and the internet for \u201cmaintaining relationships with family.\u201d The Chief Probation Officer, or their designee, may \u201climit or deny access to computer technology or the Internet for safety and security or staffing reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe request the following Tehama County Probation Department records: \r\n\r\n1. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2.

All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5.

Online:  https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/welfare-and-institutions-code/wic-sect-851-1/), a 2018 law that requires juvenile detention facilities to provide youth in custody with internet access.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this law establishes the following requirements for juvenile detention facilities: \r\n\r\n\u201cMinors detained in or committed to a juvenile hall shall be provided with access to computer technology and the Internet for the purposes of education.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe law also allows juvenile halls to provide access to computers and the internet for \u201cmaintaining relationships with family.\u201d The Chief Probation Officer, or their designee, may \u201climit or deny access to computer technology or the Internet for safety and security or staffing reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe request the following Santa Cruz County Probation Department records: \r\n\r\n1. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for maintaining familial relationships; \r\n3. All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5. All procurement records, such as RFPs, RFIs, solicitations, successful bids, and contracts/agreements with vendors for technology systems to provide minors in juvenile hall with access to computing and internet-connected technology; \r\n6. Examples of any consent, permission, and similar documents provided to parents and guardians of minors in juvenile hall related to access to computer technology and the internet;\r\n7. Any quarterly, annual, or other periodic reports that summarize the implementation of programs to comply with AB 2448 generated since 2018;\r\n8. Logs, records, or orders related to suspension of internet access, for any amount of time, \u201cfor safety and security or staffing reasons\u201d since 2018; and\r\n9. Aggregate data on the number of juvenile users of computer technology and internet systems for the period 2022 and 2023.\r\n\r\nShould these records not exist, we would appreciate a statement as to whether the agency is in compliance with AB 2448. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n- Assistance in identifying additional records and information that will assist us in understanding the state of the agency\u2019s compliance with AB 2448;\r\n- A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n- Suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $50.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $50.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request.

All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for maintaining familial relationships; \r\n3. All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5. All procurement records, such as RFPs, RFIs, solicitations, successful bids, and contracts/agreements with vendors for technology systems to provide minors in juvenile hall with access to computing and internet-connected technology; \r\n6. Examples of any consent, permission, and similar documents provided to parents and guardians of minors in juvenile hall related to access to computer technology and the internet;\r\n7. Any quarterly, annual, or other periodic reports that summarize the implementation of programs to comply with AB 2448 generated since 2018;\r\n8. Logs, records, or orders related to suspension of internet access, for any amount of time, \u201cfor safety and security or staffing reasons\u201d since 2018; and\r\n9. Aggregate data on the number of juvenile users of computer technology and internet systems for the period 2022 and 2023.\r\n\r\nShould these records not exist, we would appreciate a statement as to whether the agency is in compliance with AB 2448. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n- Assistance in identifying additional records and information that will assist us in understanding the state of the agency\u2019s compliance with AB 2448;\r\n- A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n- Suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $50.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $50.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the Muckrock.com email above or my direct email, dm@eff.org.

        "communication": "I am not requesting the name or address of the subject property owner, only the appraised value and taxation amount as well as the Property Improvements that are taxed on this property, you are more than welcome to redact the name and address of the owner of the property. If you still feel you are unable to complete this Request, please request an Attorney General Opinion as required by law. Below is the statue for reference along with the requirements for withholding information.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n-B\r\n\r\nA. \r\nDuties of the Governmental Body and of the Attorney General Under \r\nSubchapter G \r\nSections 552.301, 552.302, and 552.303 of the Government Code set out the duty of a \r\ngovernmental body to seek the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether information is excepted \r\nfrom disclosure to the public. \r\nSection 552.301, subsections (a) and (b), provides that when a governmental body receives a \r\nwritten request for information the governmental body wishes to withhold, it must seek an attorney \r\ngeneral decision within ten business days of its receipt of the request and state the exceptions to \r\ndisclosure that it believes are applicable.  Subsections (a) and (b) read: \r\n(a) A governmental body that receives a written request for information that it wishes \r\nto withhold from public disclosure and that it considers to be within one of the \r\nexceptions under Subchapter C must ask for a decision from the attorney general \r\nabout whether the information is within that exception if there has not been a \r\nprevious determination about whether the information falls within one of the \r\nexceptions. \r\n. . . \r\n(b) The governmental body must ask for the attorney general\u2019s decision and state the \r\nexceptions that apply within a reasonable time but not later than the 10th business \r\nday after the date of receiving the written request. \r\nThus, a governmental body that wishes to withhold information from the public on the ground of \r\nan exception generally must seek the decision of the attorney general as to the applicability of that \r\nexception.144  In addition, an entity contending that it is not subject to the Act may timely request \r\na decision from the attorney general to avoid the consequences of noncompliance if the entity is \r\ndetermined to be subject to the Act.145  Therefore, when requesting such a decision, the entity \r\n\r\nshould not only present its arguments as to why it is not subject to the Act, but should also raise \r\nany exceptions to required disclosure it believes apply to the requested information. \r\nA governmental body need not request an attorney general decision if there has been a previous \r\ndetermination that the requested material falls within one of the exceptions to disclosure.146  What \r\nconstitutes a \u201cprevious determination\u201d is narrow in scope, and governmental bodies are cautioned \r\nagainst treating most published attorney general decisions as \u201cprevious determinations\u201d to avoid \r\nthe requirements of section 552.301(a).  The attorney general has determined that there are two \r\ntypes of previous determinations.147  The first and by far the most common instance of a previous \r\ndetermination pertains to specific information that is again requested from a governmental body \r\nwhen the attorney general has previously issued a decision that evaluates the public availability of \r\nthe precise information or records at issue.  This first instance of a previous determination does \r\nnot apply to records that are substantially similar to records previously submitted to the attorney \r\ngeneral for review, nor does it apply to information that may fall within the same category as any \r\ngiven records on which the attorney general has previously ruled.  The first type of previous \r\ndetermination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue is precisely the same information that was previously submitted to \r\nthe attorney general pursuant to section 552.301(e)(1)(D) of the Government Code; \r\n2. the governmental body that received the request for the information is the same \r\ngovernmental body that previously requested and received a ruling from the attorney \r\ngeneral; \r\n3. the attorney general\u2019s prior ruling concluded the precise information is or is not excepted \r\nfrom disclosure under the Act; and \r\n4. the law, facts, and circumstances on which the prior attorney general ruling was based have \r\nnot changed since the issuance of the ruling.148 \r\nAbsent all four of the above criteria, and unless the second type of previous determination applies, \r\na governmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nfrom the public information that is requested under the Act. \r\nThe second type of previous determination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue falls within a specific, clearly delineated category of information \r\nabout which the attorney general has previously rendered a decision;\r\n2. the previous decision is applicable to the particular governmental body or type of \r\ngovernmental body from which the information is requested;149 \r\n3. the previous decision concludes the specific, clearly delineated category of information is \r\nor is not excepted from disclosure under the Act; \r\n4. the elements of law, fact, and circumstances are met to support the previous decision\u2019s \r\nconclusion that the requested records or information at issue is or is not excepted from \r\nrequired disclosure; and150 \r\n5. the previous decision explicitly provides that the governmental body or bodies to which \r\nthe decision applies may withhold the information without the necessity of again seeking \r\na decision from the attorney general. \r\nAbsent all five of the above criteria, and unless the first type of previous determination applies, a \r\ngovernmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nrequested information from the public under the Act.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n(b)  Information in appraisal records under Section 25.02 is confidential and is available only for the official use of the appraisal district, this state, the comptroller, and taxing units and political subdivisions of this state if:\r\n(1)  the information identifies the home address of a named individual to whom this section applies; and\r\n(2)  the individual:\r\n\r\n(A)  chooses to restrict public access to the information on the form prescribed for that purpose by the comptroller under Section 5.07; or\r\n\r\n(B)  is a federal or state judge, or the spouse of a federal or state judge, beginning on the date the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System notifies the appraisal district of the judge's qualification for the judge's office.\r\n(c)  A choice made under Subsection (b) remains valid until rescinded in writing by the individual.\r\n(d)  This section does not prohibit the public disclosure of information in appraisal records that identifies property according to an address if the information does not identify an individual who has made an election under Subsection (b) in connection with the individual's address.\r\n",
