Records that numerically separate the complaints of discrimination by present and previous employees of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. dba AdventHealth. To clarify, I request records that numerically breakdown complaints of discrimination against AdventHealth by AdventHealth location, to be interpreted as each individual location, and that it be separated by state, type of complaint of discrimination (such as on the basis of ADA, color, race, religion, sex, mental health and so to include all forms of discrimination within the scope of the EEOC).\r\n\r\n2. To preface - the distinct difference between this and (1) is filing a charge against AdventHealth - I request records that numerically separate the complaints of discrimination by present and previous employees of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. dba AdventHealth. To clarify, I request records that numerically breakdown charges of discrimination against AdventHealth and the breakdown be by AdventHealth location, to be interpreted as each individual location, and that it be separated by state, type of complaint of discrimination that led to a charge against AdventHealth (such as on the basis of ADA, color, race, religion, sex, mental health and so to include all forms of discrimination within the scope of the EEOC). If no such notion or meaningful distinction exists, then this may be disregarded.\r\n\r\n3. Records that specify that numerically indicate the charging part having won the case, so to speak, as well as by percentage, against AdventHealth (ie, Charging Party v. AdventHealth). I separately request numerically the same as the prior sentence, but excluding cases in which Charging Parties have withdrawn, not responded, or have settled with AdventHealth. To clarify, this need not include any separation by location, state, type of discrimination, and so on. \r\n\r\n4. Records that specify that numerically indicate the Respondent Party (being AdventHealth) having won the case, so to speak, as well as by percentage, against Charging Party. To clarify, this need not include any separation by location, state, type of discrimination, and so on.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Records that numerically separate the complaints of discrimination by present and previous employees of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. dba AdventHealth. To clarify, I request records that numerically breakdown complaints of discrimination against AdventHealth by AdventHealth location, to be interpreted as each individual location, and that it be separated by state, type of complaint of discrimination (such as on the basis of ADA, color, race, religion, sex, mental health and so to include all forms of discrimination within the scope of the EEOC).\r\n\r\n2. To preface - the distinct difference between this and (1) is filing a charge against AdventHealth - I request records that numerically separate the complaints of discrimination by present and previous employees of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. dba AdventHealth. To clarify, I request records that numerically breakdown charges of discrimination against AdventHealth and the breakdown be by AdventHealth location, to be interpreted as each individual location, and that it be separated by state, type of complaint of discrimination that led to a charge against AdventHealth (such as on the basis of ADA, color, race, religion, sex, mental health and so to include all forms of discrimination within the scope of the EEOC). If no such notion or meaningful distinction exists, then this may be disregarded.\r\n\r\n3. Records that specify that numerically indicate the charging part having won the case, so to speak, as well as by percentage, against AdventHealth (ie, Charging Party v. AdventHealth). I separately request numerically the same as the prior sentence, but excluding cases in which Charging Parties have withdrawn, not responded, or have settled with AdventHealth. To clarify, this need not include any separation by location, state, type of discrimination, and so on.\r\n\r\n4. Records that specify that numerically indicate the Respondent Party (being AdventHealth) having won the case, so to speak, as well as by percentage, against Charging Party. To clarify, this need not include any separation by location, state, type of discrimination, and so on.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fequal-employment-opportunity-commission-2612%252Fadventhealth-numerical-breakdown-of-discrimination-complaints-and-charges-to-the-eeoc-155379%252F%253Femail%253Dno-reply%252540login.gov&url_auth_token=AAAT_hKmibHJyo_NldUuFVfUZ8w%3A1r8xRA%3AuV_wyo4atX5nbIFvWT3A38KWL0_bXsWZbGZZYnUEcO8 \r\n  Type  \r\nNew Request  Queue  \r\nIntake \r\n  Created",

Records that detail the consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions that can be taken against a healthcare facility in summation and if there exists any meaningful difference in terms of potential for disciplinary action according to precise setting (ie, hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory clinics, and so on), within the context of the scope and authority of the ACHA.\r\n\r\n1b. Contingent upon there existing a meaningful difference in potential for disciplinary actions according to the precise setting (ie, a hospital setting versus a nursing home setting versus an ambulatory clinic) then I request records that separate out the disciplinary action for each type of healthcare facility.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the precise scope of the ACHA itself as it relates to its investigative authority, power, and methods employed when investigating healthcare facilities. Additionally, I request the persons with which possess such investigative authority by listing position titles within ACHA.\r\n\r\n3. Records, manuals, and/or guidelines that detail how the ACHA handles complaints of healthcare facilities. Additionally, I request if ACHA makes use of or employs artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs) in the handling of either complaints or investigations into healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail the precise scope and investigatory authority, power, methods employed (in the context of an investigation) as well as the precise extent of persons with investigative authority as deemed by ACHA. Additionally, if it is the case that multiple persons (meaning greater than one position title at ACHA has investigative authority) then I request records that separate both the position titles and the meaning distinction in terms of investigative authority, power, scope, and employed employed according to each position title (if such a notion and if such records exist within ACHA). \r\n\r\n5. Records that detail the complete listing of agencies with which the ACHA [regularly] cooperates with as it relates to investigations into healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate an approximate time frame for this request to be processed. Depending on the time frame for the request to be fulfilled and any fees that may be incurred, I may revise the criteria.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Records related to if or in what manner a private employer, if such private employer can be proven to be acting on behalf of the federal government, can conspire against rights (in oppressing an employee\u2019s civil rights) and the distinction between a civil and criminal manner pertaining to conspiracy against rights, if any such record exists.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to a private employer and consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions to such private employer when intentionally abusing or defrauding the United States (ie, a Federal Government Agency) and in what manner it can be said to be so, according to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n5. Records related to remedy available to employees when civil rights can be meaningfully construed to have been violated by a private employer, if such records exist.\r\n\r\n6. The most appropriate agency for which an employee may seek remedy for civil rights violations by a private employer, if not the DOJ Civil Rights Division or DOJ Criminal Division, and if known to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest.
