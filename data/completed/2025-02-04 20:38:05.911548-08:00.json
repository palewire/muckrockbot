Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

We are not sure what you meant by \"realted\". Did you mean \"related\"? Please know the term \"related\" is inexact and often requires clarification. The Washington State's Attorney General\u2019s Public Records Act Model Rules suggest that the agency should seek clarification from the requestor. The Model Rules also provide that the agency may interpret the request to be for records which directly and fairly discuss the topic. \r\n  \r\n As you may understand, the interpretation of what a record \u201crelating\" to a subject can vary from person to person. To ensure the search is both accurate and efficient, we seek to clarify your request. At this time, we interpret this portion of your request as seeking copies of payments made by requestors to obtain the responsive records released as response to their public record request(s) made in the 2024 calendar year. It is currently unknown if payments were made in the 2024 calendar year for public record requests regardless of what year the request was made and we will search for and provide those too, should they exist. If any of this interpretation is not accurate, please let us know within 30 days. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Your request to know the total feeTotal fees will be ascertained once all the responsive records have been compiled for this request. At this stage, we have gathered records together that will require a fee of $3.50 to be paid. Once the installment has been reviewed and redactions applied, we will then inform you what the fee will be for the records. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Washington State Public Records Act RCW 42.56, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested. The District anticipates being able to release records responsive to your public record request on or before February 5, 2025. If we are able to provide the records to you sooner, we will do so. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",

The charge for the records is $3.75. The records may be paid for at the cashier\u2019s desk on the second floor of the Administration building. Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.75. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be made available to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201 Attn: Public Records Office. \r\n  \r\n Please note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency\u2019s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records. \r\n  \r\n Please also note that some records have been redated with a black text block that include white writing of an exemption key code (01-24) over the protected word or words. You will see the Redaction Exemption Key added to the last page of each record that was redacted. You will know which record has been redacted as the word \"Redacted\" has been added to the end of the title of the released record. Student names and identifying information is protected from release and has been redacted under 20 USC Sect. 1232g; RCW 42.56.230(2)(a)(iii). RCW 42.56.230(5) Credit card numbers and bank account numbers are exempt from disclosure and have been redacted from these records. \r\n  \r\n The District has provided copies of legal invoices, purchase orders of technology and supplies used for public record requests, and amount that requestors paid for their public record requests, also provided salary and benefits of staff that work on public record requests. This concludes the District\u2019s response to this request as the District considers this request to be fulfilled and closed. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of the District\u2019s response and records produced has started to run because the District does not intend to further address this request. The one year statute of limitations means you have one year to challenge the District\u2019s response and responsive records released to you. \r\n  \r\n If you have follow up questions about this request, please ask within the next 30 days. Please let us know if you believe additional responsive records have not been provided or if we have misunderstood or misinterpreted your request. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please also let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",

DI-25-000310 DI-25-000325 DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nTo:\r\nFOIA Officer\r\nOffice of the Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 218\r\nWashington, D.C. 20036-4505\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Comprehensive Records on Specified Cases\r\nComplete documentation, communications, and records related to the following cases:\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros (DI) - Case Open Dates:\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 2024, 7:36 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nNovember 28, 2024, 11:13 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 2, 2024, 8:00 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 3, 2024, 2:30 PM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 5, 2024, 9:11 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 6, 2024, 12:33 PM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 7, 2024, 5:53 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nCase Numbers and Related Details:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310: Closed as of November 25, 2024\r\nDI-25-000325: Closed as of November 27, 2024\r\nDI-25-000379: Closed as of December 9, 2024\r\n\r\nPattern of Non-Compliance by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\nI must emphasize that the OSC has repeatedly and willfully failed to comply with clearly outlined ADA accommodation requests, including:\r\n\r\nFailure to Identify FOIA Officers: OSC has continually failed to disclose the names, titles, and roles of FOIA officers and decision-makers responsible for processing previous requests. This omission is concerning and raises significant issues regarding transparency, accountability, and compliance with FOIA mandates.\r\n\r\nThese repeated failures directly violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Rehabilitation Act, and FOIA transparency requirements. It is imperative that the OSC address these concerns immediately and provide the requested accommodations without further obstruction.\r\n\r\n2. Records to Include\r\nCase Files: All records related to OSC\u2019s review, processing, and closure of the above cases.\r\nCorrespondence: Internal and external communications (emails, directives, meeting notes) involving OSC personnel handling these cases.\r\nRationale for Case Status: Specific records detailing the decisions to mark cases as \"Duplicate/Add'l Info\" or to close them, with supporting documentation.\r\nReferrals: Any communications or referrals made to other agencies concerning these cases.\r\nTimeframe\r\nThis request covers records from November 1, 2024, to the present to ensure comprehensive inclusion of all case-related materials.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance\r\nI require all records to be provided in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Please ensure:\r\n\r\nCommunication via MuckRock Platform:\r\n\r\nAll responses, updates, and records must be delivered exclusively via Muckrock. No physical mail, phone calls, external links, passwords or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body:\r\nProvide summarized responses directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs:\r\nAttachments must be clearly labeled, properly formatted, and fully accessible.\r\nSimplified Summaries:\r\nInclude plain-language summaries for complex or technical records to aid comprehension.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Request\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates full and timely disclosure of requested records unless exemptions explicitly apply.\r\nAny redactions or withholdings must include detailed statutory citations (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)) and clear explanations.\r\n2. ADA Compliance (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nPublic entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. Accessible document formatting and accommodations are legally required.\r\n3. Whistleblower Protection\r\nAs the cases directly involve whistleblower disclosures and protections, prompt access to these records is critical to ensure transparency and accountability under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nThis request is not for commercial purposes. I request a waiver of all fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), as disclosure of these records serves the public interest in promoting transparency, whistleblower protection, and ADA compliance.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nExpedited processing is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) based on:\r\n\r\nSignificant Public Interest: The implications for systemic accountability and whistleblower protections.\r\nUrgency: Timely transparency is necessary to address ongoing ADA compliance concerns and retaliation claims.\r\nIdentification of Personnel\r\nPlease include the names, titles, and roles of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel involved in processing this request for transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDelivery and Response\r\nAcknowledge receipt of this request within five (5) business days.\r\nProvide requested records within the statutory timeframe.\r\nFor any denials or partial redactions, include detailed justifications, appeal instructions, and the name of the reviewing authority.\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA or ADA requirements may result in:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Oversight: Filing of formal complaints with the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).\r\nLegal Action: Pursuit of remedies under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Escalation through media and public channels to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This response serves to address your communications, provide required documentation, and ensure adherence to statutory obligations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Rehabilitation Act, and FOIA mandates.\r\n\r\nSection 1: Response to OSC\u2019s Communications\r\n1.1 Expedited Processing Justification\r\nAs previously outlined, my request meets the criteria for expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E):\r\n\r\nSignificant Public Interest: The requested records pertain to systemic ADA non-compliance, whistleblower retaliation, and accountability within federal agencies. These issues directly impact public trust, program integrity, and taxpayer-funded operations.\r\nUrgency to Address Ongoing Harm: Delayed transparency enables continued harm to vulnerable populations reliant on equitable Medicaid services. This urgency demands immediate corrective action.\r\n1.2 ADA Accommodation Compliance\r\nTo ensure full compliance with Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, I reiterate the following legally mandated accommodations:\r\n\r\nExclusive Communication via MuckRock: All correspondence, updates, and records must be delivered exclusively via MuckRock. External links, portals, physical mail, or password-protected access points are non-compliant.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs: Provide all documents as properly formatted, labeled, and accessible PDFs.\r\nPlain-Language Summaries: Include simplified summaries for complex or technical records to enhance comprehension.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Provide summarized responses directly in email bodies for immediate accessibility.\r\nIdentification of FOIA Personnel: Disclose the names, titles, and roles of all OSC personnel handling this request to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\nFailure to adhere to these accommodations is a violation of federal law and constitutes discrimination under the ADA.\r\n\r\n1.3 Identification Submission\r\nI will provide the requested identification promptly. Please confirm receipt and update the status of my request to avoid further unnecessary delays.\r\n\r\n1.4 Transparency Concerns\r\nOSC\u2019s repeated non-compliance with FOIA and ADA obligations raises concerns regarding accountability. I request immediate clarification on:\r\n\r\nThe rationale for marking cases as \"Duplicate/Add\u2019l Info\" or closing them without resolution, including supporting documentation.\r\nJustifications for any redactions or denials, citing explicit statutory exemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nA clear timeline for fulfilling this request.\r\nSection 2: Legal Grounds for Compliance\r\n2.1 FOIA Compliance\r\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) mandates timely disclosure of records and detailed justifications for redactions or denials. Non-compliance undermines public trust and accountability.\r\nFee Waiver: As this request serves the public interest and has no commercial purpose, I request confirmation of a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n2.2 ADA Compliance\r\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132: Mandates effective communication and reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities. OSC\u2019s prior failures to comply require immediate rectification.\r\n2.3 Whistleblower Protection\r\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8): Transparency is essential to ensure protections for whistleblowers reporting systemic violations.\r\nSection 3: Corrective Actions Requested\r\nTo resolve this matter, I request the following actions:\r\n\r\nImmediate Release of Records: Fulfill my request for records, including correspondence, case files, and decision-making documentation, in ADA-compliant formats.\r\nConfirmation of Accommodations: Explicitly confirm adherence to all listed accommodations moving forward.\r\nIdentification of Personnel: Provide the names, titles, and contact details of OSC personnel managing this request.\r\nExpedited Processing Approval: Approve expedited processing to meet the urgency criteria outlined above.\r\nDetailed Timeline: Submit a clear and reasonable timeline for fulfilling this request.\r\nSection 4: Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nContinued failure to comply with statutory requirements may result in:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Oversight: Filing formal complaints with OGIS, DOJ Civil Rights Division, and the ADA National Network.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Pursuing legal action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133 for violations of FOIA and ADA statutes.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic failures to media outlets, advocacy organizations, and congressional oversight committees to demand accountability.\r\nSection 5: Closing Remarks\r\nI trust that OSC will take these concerns seriously and implement immediate corrective actions. Compliance with FOIA and ADA obligations is a legal necessity, and adherence to these principles is essential to maintaining public trust.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this response and provide updates on the requested actions. I remain available for further clarification at AabiWR@live.com.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\nABI Resources https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf https://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2 \r\nTracking Number: FOIA-2025-060\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nMerrick B.

Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions. Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the foundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal mandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress.

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\n\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\n\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\n\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\n\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\n\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\n\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\n\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\n\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\n\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\n\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\n\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\n\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\n\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\n\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\n\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\n\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\n\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\n\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n_______\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G.

Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions.

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\n\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\n\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\n\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\n\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\n\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\n\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\n\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\n\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\n\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\n\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\n\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\n\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\n\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\n\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\n\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\n\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\n\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\n\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n_______\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:  \r\n  \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n  \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n  \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n  \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n  \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n  \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.  \r\n  \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n  \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.  \r\n  \r\nSincerely,  \r\nMakayla Connor\r\nJ.D. Candidate \r\nResearch Assistant \r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration  \r\nconnor.mak@northeastern.edu \r\n(508) 340-1740\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMakayla Connor",

It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present. This scope includes, but is not limited to, emails, text messages, digital communications, internal memoranda, directives, meeting notes, attachments, drafts, and related working documents across all relevant departments, divisions, or offices.\r\n\r\n1. Medicaid Billing Suspension and Sandata EVV Ticket #539494 (CMS and DSS)\r\nComprehensive Communications and Directives: Full records (emails, memos, reports, directives, attachments, text messages) from DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies concerning Medicaid billing privileges for ABI Resources, LLC, including names and roles of those involved in discussions and approvals.\r\n\r\nComplete Documentation of Sandata EVV Ticket #539494: All records associated with Ticket #539494, including:\r\n\r\nInitial ticket details, problem descriptions, resolution requests, and follow-ups.\r\nCommunications detailing each stage of the ticket\u2019s handling, the reason for marking it \u201cresolved,\u201d and personnel involved in closing it.\r\n2. Retaliatory Actions Following December 18, 2023, Whistleblower Report (DSS, CMS, DOJ, OSC)\r\nInternal and External Correspondence: All records, including emails, directives, text messages, memos, and meeting notes, discussing the whistleblower report filed on December 18, 2023, including responses, assessments, and any retaliatory actions considered or taken against ABI Resources.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of Investigative Actions: All documentation related to any investigations launched in response to the whistleblower complaint, identifying personnel involved, findings, and any recommendations or disciplinary actions.\r\n\r\n3. ADA Compliance Documentation and Accommodation Requests (OCR, DOJ, DSS, CMS)\r\nADA Accommodation Requests: All records concerning ADA accommodations requested by David Medeiros and ABI Resources, with full documentation of responses, denials, and any internal discussions on ADA compliance obligations.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance Policies and Internal Guidelines: Copies of internal policies, training materials, and guidelines used by DSS and CMS related to ADA compliance, particularly on communication accessibility and auxiliary aids for individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\n4. Records on Program Changes Impacting ABI Resources (DSS, CMS)\r\nCompanion Authorizations Termination Records: All communications, policy documents, and assessments on the termination of companion authorizations for the ABI Waiver Program as of December 31, 2023, including any correspondence between DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies related to this decision.\r\n5. Documentation of Specific Individuals\u2019 Involvement (All Relevant Agencies)\r\nRecords Involving Named Personnel:\r\nAndrea Barton Reeves, Commissioner, DSS\r\nMatthew S. Antonetti, Legal Director, DSS\r\nAstread Ferron-Poole, DSS Associate\r\nMichelle A. James and Emmett Nicholson, CMS officials overseeing Medicaid compliance\r\nAll communications, directives, notes, meeting minutes, or any form of correspondence or records involving the above-named individuals with respect to ABI Resources, LLC, particularly regarding Medicaid billing restrictions, ADA accommodation requests, and actions following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for FOIA Request and Compliance Mandates\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

        "communication": "12.04.2024 Subject: Appeal Immediate Compliance Required with ADA Accommodations and FOIA Obligations\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer\r\nI am writing to formally reiterate my request for specific ADA accommodations and compliance with FOIA obligations, which are essential for my full participation in this process. These accommodations were explicitly requested to address accessibility needs stemming from my traumatic brain injury and to ensure compliance with federal law. To date, your office has failed to meet these requirements, resulting in undue barriers and systemic non-compliance.\r\n\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\nTo rectify these ongoing failures and ensure compliance with federal laws, I demand the following actions be taken without delay:\r\n\r\nTransition All Communications to MuckRock\r\n\r\nImmediately cease the use of external portals or non-compliant communication methods and ensure all responses are routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform.\r\nProvide Accessible Documents\r\n\r\nReformat and resend all previously provided documents as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed to ensure accessibility.\r\nInclude Simplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide simplified summaries for all complex or technical records, both previously shared and in future communications, to ensure accessibility and equitable participation.\r\nIdentify Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nInclude the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for every communication moving forward to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\nLegal Basis for Compliance\r\nYour office is legally obligated to comply with these accommodations under the following statutes and principles:\r\n\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandate reasonable accommodations and accessibility in communications for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA): 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 requires transparency, accessibility, and adherence to procedural fairness.\r\nConstitutional Protections: The First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution safeguard my rights to petition the government, due process, and equal protection under the law.\r\nExecutive Order 13392: Mandates improved agency disclosure of information to enhance transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nYour office must confirm compliance with these accommodations and provide the requested corrective actions within five (5) business days of this notice. Continued non-compliance will be documented as a violation of the ADA and FOIA and may result in escalation, including:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Seeking injunctive relief and damages for ADA and FOIA violations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic failures to oversight agencies, media, and advocacy organizations.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis communication serves as a final request for compliance. It is imperative that your office address these deficiencies promptly to restore transparency, accessibility, and adherence to federal law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and resolution by the stated deadline.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\n\r\nCC\r\nFederal Officials\r\nMerrick B.

(Link to request https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/arizona-ice-detention-center-suicide-sirs-sens-98784/). A copy of responsive records produced by ICE last time is publicly available here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23684926-2020-icfo-68105-jan-2023. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request \r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and make the following statements under penalty of perjury in support of thereof: \r\n1. A review of records previously released by ICE in response to a similar request reveals that dozens of suicide attempts at multiple ICE facilities in Arizona are not documented in the Nakamoto Group\u2019s inspections of these facilities. \r\n2. Significant Incident Summaries, including suicide attempts, form a core part of the Congressionally mandated inspections regime governing ICE facilities. \r\n3. If a facility fails two consecutive inspections, federal appropriations law prevents ICE from continuing to expend federal funds to detain people at that facility. \r\n4. A facility\u2019s decision to withhold material information about suicide attempts from ICE\u2019s outside auditors compromises the integrity of that facility\u2019s inspection, and undermines the credibility of compliance findings by those auditors. \r\n5. Suicide is the leading cause of preventable death in ICE custody since at least 2016, with ICE and its contractors frequently violating their own standards in cases of suicide. See, e.g., https://keck.usc.edu/ice-violated-its-own-internal-medical-standards-potentially-contributing-to-deaths-of-mostly-healthy-men/. \r\n6. Systemic suppression of records showing suicide attempts in ICE facilities threatens the life and safety of individuals inside. It further threatens those individuals\u2019 substantial due process rights to be treated in a manner that ensures preservation of life, health, and safety. \r\n7. Deaths in ICE custody represent a widespread and exceptional topic of media coverage about which possible questions exist as to the integrity of government functions that could impact public confidence in the agency. \r\n8. These records will be immediately processed, and disseminated upon receipt from ICE> \r\n9. ICE FOIA apparently generated responsive records for the previous FOIA without one month of receiving the request \u2014 in August 2020 \u2014 according to the text at the bottom of each printed SIR. ICE\u2019s FOIA Office then, inexplicably, took nearly 2 years to process and release these 176 pages of records. \r\n\r\nWe make this request on behalf of the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative at Al Otro Lado. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Your request was received in this office on 2/18/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.

Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was processed in accordance with the FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and FHFA's FOIA regulation (12 CFR Part 1202).\r\n\r\nYou requested the following:\r\n\r\n\"1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\"\r\n\r\nA search of FHFA files and records located material responsive to your request. The records are being partially released (redacted) pursuant to exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (b)(6), as disclosure of certain information (e.g., telephone numbers, email addresses, etc.), \"would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" In response to numbers 1 - 3 of your request, please find attached 3 pages. In response to number 4 of your request, the total full-time equivalent count of people who work for FHFA's FOIA Office was 1 during the requested period.\r\n\r\nThis is FHFA's final decision on your FOIA request. If you wish to appeal any aspect of FHFA's decision on your request, you must forward within 90 days:\r\n\r\n* A copy of your initial request;\r\n* A copy of this letter; and\r\n* A statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments for seeking disclosure of the affected record(s).\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be sent either electronically by 5pm to foia@fhfa.gov or by mail to the \"FOIA Appeals Officer\" at 400 7th Street, SW, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20219. The subject line, or the envelope and the letter of appeal, must be clearly marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Please note that all mail sent to FHFA via the United States Postal Service is routed through a national irradiation facility, a process that may delay delivery by approximately two weeks. For any time-sensitive correspondence, please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration. OGIS can be reached at 8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; by email at ogis@nara.gov; by telephone at 202-741-5770 or toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or by facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nYour FOIA request is releasable to the public under subsequent FOIA requests. In responding to these requests, FHFA does not release personal information, such as home or email addresses and home or mobile telephone numbers which are protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)).\r\n\r\nThere are no fees associated with processing this request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the processing of your request, please contact me directly or at foia@fhfa.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nStacy J.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Requester \u2013\r\n\r\nPlease allow this email to acknowledge your January 16, 2025, request (\u201cRequest\u201d) pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq., received on January 16, 2025.  On January 23, 2025, the Office properly extended the time to respond to your request by five (5) business days to January 31, 2025.  Your Request seeks the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A copy of every administrative subpoena received by [the Office] from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and/or the Department of Homeland Security between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2022.\r\n  2.  A copy of all email or mailed communications sent to or received from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and/or the Department of Homeland Security that pertains to administrative subpoenas received between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2022.\r\n\r\nThe Office has conducted a reasonably diligent search of its physical and electronic databases and has identified certain responsive records to your Request within its possession and custody.  The responsive record is attached with this correspondence.  However, the Office has redacted certain exempt information contained within the responsive records pursuant to applicable FOIA exemptions.  The Office\u2019s factual basis for this partial denial of your request is detailed below.\r\n\r\nThe Office has redacted unique identifiers, including social security numbers; driver\u2019s license numbers; and signatures (Ill. Att\u2019y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14-015, issued March 25, 2014, at 11) from the responsive record pursuant to FOIA exemption 7(1)(b), which expressly exempts private information from disclosure.  5 ILCS 140/2(c-5); 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\r\n\r\nThe disclosure of the following information is a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and therefore the Office is withholding the following information: date of birth (IIl. Att\u2019y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 16-0098, issued November 7, 2016, at 12); other third-party names, for instance, the names of suspected who were never arrested and of other persons referenced incidentally in reports, such as relatives or neighbors (Ill. Att\u2019y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 31526, issued November 26, 2014, at 6).  5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c).\r\n\r\nNote:  You have the right to have any denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (\u201cPAC\u201d) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General.  5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).  You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to:  Public Access Counselor, Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd St., Springfield, IL 62701, (877) 299-3642, public.access@ilag.gov<mailto:public.access@ilag.gov>.  5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).  You also have the right to seek judicial review by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court.  5 ILCS 140/11.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n[A close-up of a coin  Description automatically generated with medium confidence]\r\nFOIA OFFICER\r\nSecretary of State Alexi Giannoulias\r\n115 S.

This includes predictive models and ADSs built in-house as well as those built by vendors for the agency or those used by agency employees through third-party software.\r\n\r\n2) All contracts and statements of work regarding the purchase and/or creation of tools identified in response to part one of this request.\r\n\r\n2) A data dictionary/library for each predictive model and ADS identified in response to part one of this request. Please note: Data dictionaries list the names of data fields (i.e. column headers in a spreadsheet), they do not contain the actual data analyzed by models.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this request, please don't hesitate to contact me for further clarification.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of responsive documents, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",
