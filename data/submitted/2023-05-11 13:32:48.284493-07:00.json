        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Officer\r\nTransportation Security Administration\r\n601 South 12th Street\r\nArlington, VA 20598\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to submit a limited Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking records related to two areas of interest within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA): personnel records of TSA employees and records related to the TSA's use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies for the period of the last two years (2021-2023).\r\n\r\nFirstly, I request any and all training programs and materials provided to TSA agents in the last two years, including any materials related to cultural competency or implicit bias training. Additionally, I would like to obtain any disciplinary actions taken against TSA agents, including any records related to employee misconduct, violations of TSA policies and procedures, or complaints filed against TSA agents. Lastly, I request internal investigations of TSA employees in the last two years, including any records related to allegations of abuse, harassment, or discrimination by TSA agents.\r\n\r\nThese records will help to provide transparency and accountability for the TSA's actions in maintaining high standards of conduct among its personnel. In support of this request, I would like to cite several court cases, including EPIC v. DHS, 615 F.3d 519 (D.C. Cir. 2010), where the court held that the TSA must release documents related to the effectiveness and privacy impact of body scanners used at airports. The court found that the public interest in transparency and accountability outweighed any privacy concerns related to the release of these records. Additionally, in NARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), the Supreme Court held that FOIA requires the disclosure of records that could reasonably be interpreted as indicating an agency's ability or willingness to protect the privacy of individuals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I request any training materials and manuals provided to TSA agents on the use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies in the last two years. Furthermore, I request technical specifications for the scanners and technologies used by TSA agents. Additionally, I would like to obtain any reports or studies conducted by the TSA or other organizations related to the effectiveness and safety of these technologies in the last two years. Lastly, I request any records related to complaints or incidents related to the use of these technologies in the last two years, including any reports of malfunctions, false positives, or privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nThese records will help to ensure the effective and safe use of advanced imaging technologies and provide insights into any privacy concerns associated with their use. In support of this request, I would like to cite the case of Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), where the court held that the Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures and that a warrant is required to conduct a search, absent some exception.\r\n\r\nFOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless they are exempt from disclosure under one of nine exemptions listed in the statute. If you determine that any of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide a written explanation of the exemption and the specific reasons why it applies.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Specifically, I request the following:\r\n\r\nAll reports, analyses, and briefings that discuss or analyze the use of quantum computing by the NSA or its contractors for intelligence, encryption, or other purposes.\r\n\r\nAll contracts, grants, and other agreements between the NSA and any other entities, including private companies and academic institutions, related to research or development of quantum computing technology.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence, including emails, memos, and letters, related to the NSA's use or research of quantum computing technology.\r\n\r\nAll budget documents and spending reports related to the NSA's activities and expenditures related to quantum computing.\r\n\r\nAll policies and guidelines related to the NSA's use or research of quantum computing technology, including any regulations or laws governing the use of such technology.\r\n\r\nThe time frame for this request is the last five years, from January 1, 2018, to the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nI ask that you conduct a search for all responsive records in a manner that is reasonably calculated to locate all records within the scope of this request. Please do not construe my use of the word \"any\" to be an attempt to limit the scope of this request. Rather, I intend it to be inclusive of all records within the specified time frame that are responsive to this request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I am requesting that you provide me with a list of all databases, systems, or other records repositories that were searched, and provide an explanation of the search methods used to identify and locate the records responsive to my request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that a Glomar response, neither confirming nor denying the existence of records, is not appropriate in this case, as there is already public information indicating that the NSA has been involved in quantum computing research and development. See, e.g., \"NSA Research Directorate's Quantum Program,\" GovernmentCIO Magazine (Feb. 20, 2018).\r\n\r\nIf any part of my request is denied, please provide a detailed explanation for the denial and cite the specific statutory exemption(s) relied upon. In addition, I request that you provide me with any segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Detainee deaths have been the subject of widespread media attention culminating in congressional action, including the mandatory reporting requirements ICE itself describes. https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting. ICE is currently violating that law by allotting itself 90 days instead of 30. The purpose of the Death Report publication requirement is to ensure Congress and the public have information about deaths in custody. Access to timely, complete, and accurate information allows the public to take protective actions and advocate policies that could reduce these deaths. For instance, public outcry over in-custody deaths resulted in Congress ordering the DHS Office of Inspector General to conduct an annual review of ICE and CBP in-custody deaths to determine if any systemic issues contributed to those tragedies and make recommendations about how to address those issues. See https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-02/OIG-23-12-Feb23.pdf. \r\n\r\nAs of the date of this request - May 11, 2023 - ICE is in violation of the 30-day Death Report publication requirement. This means the ICE detention system is violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, and ICE leaders are potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties. \r\n\r\nPlease grant this request expedited processing and bring ICE into compliance by posting the detainee death report for Mr. Vargas on ICE\u2019s FOIA reading room, or supplying it to the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative so that we may post it publicly. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the folks in charge of IHSC, Smith and Rivera are the IHSC officials with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by them about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving these officials\u2019 emails for historians and experts to understand their response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Acting Director, the prior head of ICE\u2019s Custody Management Division, and the agency\u2019s Acting Director during both the Trump and Biden Administrations, Tae Johnson is the single official with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by him about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving Johnon\u2019s emails for historians and experts to understand his response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "This is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I request all records related to Elmer Howard Maas, Jr., born 29 August 1935 in Kansas City, MO; died 8 May 2005, http://baltimorenonviolencecenter.blogspot.com/2009/05/remembering-elmer-maas-he-died-on.html. Mr. Maas was an anti-nuclear peace activist and a member of the \"Plowshares Eight,\" a group of nonviolent protesters who  staged an anti-nuclear protest at a General Electric plant on 9 September 1980.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of the Bureau's records on the following people, organizations, and events to see if they contain additional records regarding the subject:\r\n1. Plowshares Movement\r\n2. Plowshares Eight anti-nuclear protest of 9 September 1980\r\n3. Daniel Joseph Berrigan, born 9 May 1921 in Virginia, MN, USA; died 30 April 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/nyregion/daniel-j-berrigan-defiant-priest-who-preached-pacifism-dies-at-94.html\r\n4. Philip Francis Berrigan, born 5 October 1923 in Two Harbors, MN, USA; died 6 December 2002, https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/us/philip-berrigan-former-priest-peace-advocate-vietnam-war-era-dies-79.html\r\n5. Carl Kabat, born 10 October 1933 in Scheller, IL, USA; died 4 August 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/carl-kabat-dead.html\r\n6. Anne Montgomery, born 30 November 1926 in San Diego, CA, USA; died 27 August 2012, https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/sr-anne-montgomery-plowshares-leader-against-nuclear-weapons-dies\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center and the Central Records Complex (CRC) in Winchester/Frederick County, Virginia. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, please produce all records related to the transfer or destruction. If previously-released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Maas has died, meaning that the Bureau will now be able to release records that were not previously available publicly.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Maas was a public figure. His participation in the Plowshares Eight protest made him a subject of national and international attention. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records publicly available online for free via MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because records related to Mr. Maas are also contained in the files of the other members of the Plowshares Eight. Thus, those records can now be un-redacted as well.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion: on balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.",

I am not limiting my request to a specific type or subset of records, but rather seeking all records that contain the requested information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request that any responsive records be provided in a format that is accessible to individuals with disabilities, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Section 508 standards.\r\n\r\nWith that clarification, I request the following information:\r\n\r\nAny and all documents, including but not limited to reports, spreadsheets, or data tables, that contain information about the power consumption of the above-listed NSA data centers, including:\r\n\r\na. The total amount of power consumed by each data center on an annual basis for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nb. The sources of energy used (e.g., coal, natural gas, renewable sources) for each data center for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nc. Any efforts or initiatives by the NSA to reduce energy consumption or improve energy efficiency at each data center, including any plans or programs in place for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all documents, including but not limited to reports, spreadsheets, or data tables, that contain information about the bandwidth usage of the above-listed NSA data centers, including:\r\n\r\na. The total amount of data transmitted and received by each data center on an annual basis for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nb. The sources and types of data transmitted and received (e.g., voice, text, images, video) for each data center for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nc. Any efforts or initiatives by the NSA to reduce bandwidth usage or improve network efficiency at each data center, including any plans or programs in place for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all correspondence, including emails and memos, between NSA officials and other federal agencies, contractors, or private companies, regarding the energy usage or efficiency or bandwidth usage or efficiency of the above-listed NSA data centers, including any information related to the power consumption or bandwidth usage of these facilities.\r\n\r\nAny and all records, including but not limited to contracts or agreements, related to the procurement or purchase of energy or network equipment for the above-listed NSA data centers for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all records related to the maintenance or repair of equipment or systems related to energy usage or efficiency or bandwidth usage or efficiency for the above-listed NSA data centers for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that all responsive records are included, please conduct a search that includes all files, documents, and electronic data created or received by the NSA from January 1, 2018, to the date of your processing this FOIA request. If any responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please provide a detailed justification for each exemption and segregate any non-exempt portions for release.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to cite the following case law in support of this FOIA request:\r\n\r\nIn Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 923 F. Supp. 2d 237, 242-44 (D.D.C. 2013), the court held that energy usage data of government facilities was not protected by Exemption 3 or Exemption 4 of the FOIA and must be disclosed.\r\nIn Natural Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 191 F. Supp. 2d41, 54 (D.D.C. 2002), the court held that a request for information on energy usage and efficiency of government facilities is not unduly burdensome and must be processed under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the use of a Glomar response, I would like to state that the existence of responsive records is not classified or exempt from disclosure under FOIA. I am requesting information that is not classified or sensitive in nature, and the release of which would not harm national security or any ongoing investigation or operation.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request any and all internal directives or policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) regarding EOIR\u2019s process for contracting out, obtaining, and reviewing transcripts of hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ) for review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), as required by the BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.2(f). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request any current internal directives, manuals, memos, policy guidance, or other documents related to:  \r\n1.\tProcesses and procedures for assigning Digital Audio Recording(s) (\u201cDAR\u201d) to transcription contractors, including but not limited to Free State Reporting, Inc. (\u201cFree State\u201d), to be transcribed for purposes of creating the Record of Proceeding(s) (\u201cROP\u201d) for review by the BIA (see attached document for previous guidance, last updated in 2015)\r\n2.\tAny training, education, or certification EOIR requires of transcribers or the transcription companies with which EOIR contracts;\r\n3.\tAny policies and guidance regarding EOIR oversight and quality control over the transcription process, including any quality control checklists used by EOIR staff; \r\n4.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR takes when the transcription contractor sends back a defective or otherwise unsatisfactory transcript, for example one with significant typos, indiscernible notations, or other errors, including any processes for returning a defective or unsatisfactory transcript to the transcription contractor to be re-transcribed;\r\n5.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR and/or the transcription contractor takes when the DAR is partially or totally inaudible such that it cannot be properly transcribed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that EOIR waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding how and when immigration proceedings are transcribed for appellate purposes. CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations\u2014representing non-citizens before EOIR.  As a provider of legal services to non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients.\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is currently briefing a Petition for Review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in which defects in the transcript present a central issue on appeal. Information about the transcription process will help CAIR Coalition articulate legal arguments about our client's due process right to meaningful appellate review and advocate for broadly applicable law and procedures to be employed when a defective transcript is hindering review. Petitioner's opening brief to the Fourth Circuit is due on June 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords Access Officer\r\nNew York City Department of Environmental Protection\r\n59-17 Junction Blvd.\r\n19th Floor\r\nFlushing, NY 11373\r\n\r\nDear Records Access Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to request access to detailed records related to the helicopter flight with tail number NY120NY that occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on May 9th, 2023, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\r\n\r\nFOIA was enacted to ensure that the public has access to information held by the government, subject to certain limited exemptions. The Supreme Court has recognized that FOIA \"reflects our nation's fundamental commitment to open government\" (New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971) and that the government has a \"heavy burden\" to prove that information should be kept secret (id.). FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed, and the government has the burden of proving that the information requested is exempt from disclosure (United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 1989).\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is as comprehensive as possible, I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nFlight Logs: Please provide all records related to the helicopter flight, including but not limited to flight logs that detail the flight paths and actions taken during the flight. These records should include information about the time of takeoff and landing, the duration of the flight, and any stops made during the flight.\r\nVideo Logs: Please provide all video logs captured by the helicopter's onboard cameras during the flight. These logs should include all footage captured during the flight, including footage of any stops made during the flight.\r\nTransmissions: Please provide all records of transmissions between the helicopter and ground personnel or any other parties during the flight. These records should include any audio recordings or written transcripts of these transmissions.\r\nMaintenance and Safety Records: Please provide any records related to the helicopter's maintenance and safety inspections, as well as the pilot's certifications and qualifications.\r\nWeather and Air Traffic Information: Please provide all weather and air traffic information that was available to the pilot during the flight.\r\nPilot Logbook: Please provide the pilot's logbook for the flight, which should include the pilot's flight hours, certifications, and qualifications.\r\nFlight Plan: Please provide the flight plan for the helicopter flight, including any revisions made to the plan before or during the flight.\r\nCommunications between DEP and Other Agencies: Please provide any records of communications between the DEP and other agencies related to the helicopter flight.\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: Please provide any body-worn camera footage that was recorded by DEP personnel during the flight, if available.\r\nRecords of Stops or Interactions: Please provide any records related to any stops or interactions that occurred during the flight, including but not limited to any reports or logs of interactions with members of the public or other agencies.\r\nThe courts have held that agencies must conduct a \"reasonable search\" for records responsive to a FOIA request, and that the adequacy of an agency's search is to be judged by the reasonableness of the efforts made, not by the results achieved (Electronic Privacy Information Center v. United States Department of Homeland Security, 2006). I would like to request that these records be provided to me in an electronic format, if possible, to reduce the cost and time associated with printing and mailing.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of these records is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, please provide an explanation of the basis for the exemption, consistent with the courts' holding that FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed and that the government has the burden of proving that information should be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
