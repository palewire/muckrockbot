Stuart Christie was jailed in Spain in 1964 for his involvement in a plot to assassinated Francisco Franco. He was released from prison after four years, and was later accused and acquitted of involvement in an organization called \"The Angry Brigade\" that carried out firebombings against targets such as the US Embassy in London. \r\n\r\nChristie was also a writer of a number of books related to anarchism. He was also an editor of the Soviet-era, English language version of the newsweekly Argumenty i Fakty (\"Arguments and Facts\") in London. This was a publication that disseminated Soviet propaganda during the final years of the Soviet Union. \r\n\r\nMr. Christie's 2020 death was widely discussed in the mainstream media and on social media. Please take a look at an obituary from The Guardian newspaper, which should be attached to this request.  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/17/stuart-christie-obituary\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Stuart Christie.\r\n\r\nAccording to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Stuart Christie.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Stuart Christie was jailed in\r\n    Spain in 1964 for his involvement in a plot to assassinated Francisco\r\n    Franco. He was released from prison after four years, and was later accused\r\n    and acquitted of involvement in an organization called \"The Angry Brigade\"\r\n    that carried out firebombings against targets such as the US Embassy in\r\n    London.\r\n    \r\n    Christie was also a writer of a number of books related to anarchism. He was\r\n    also an editor of the Soviet-era, English language version of the newsweekly\r\n    Argumenty i Fakty (\"Arguments and Facts\") in London. This was a publication\r\n    that disseminated Soviet propaganda during the final years of the Soviet\r\n    Union.\r\n    \r\n    Mr. Christie's 2020 death was widely discussed in the mainstream media and\r\n    on social media. Please take a look at an obituary from The Guardian\r\n    newspaper, which should be attached to this request.\r\n    \r\n    https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/17/stuart-christie-obituary\r\n    \r\n    Please include all potentially responsive materials, including but not\r\n    limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations,\r\n    photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please\r\n    include all materials found in other subject files and all materials\r\n    associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases,\r\n    nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references\r\n    utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and\r\n    records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and\r\n    records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance\r\n    (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available\r\n    cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other\r\n    locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Stuart\r\n    Christie.\r\n    \r\n    According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the\r\n    following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records\r\n    stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still\r\n    technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR\r\n    1250.8\" Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records\r\n    Center in Suitland, for records related to Stuart Christie.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

We\r\n> look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business\r\n> days, as the statute requires.\r\n>\r\n> WAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n>\r\n> For most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a\r\n> record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing\r\n> information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of\r\n> any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or\r\n> retained\" by an agency.\r\n> (1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical\r\n> form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very\r\n> broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating,\r\n> photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication\r\n> or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures,\r\n> sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic\r\n> or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and\r\n> video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound\r\n> recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from\r\n> which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An\r\n> email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also\r\n> \"writings.\"\r\n> (2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a\r\n> document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of\r\n> any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all\r\n> records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n> (3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record\r\n> \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\n> A record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually\r\n> possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making\r\n> process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered\r\n> technical specifications of a public works project and returned the\r\n> specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would\r\n> be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its\r\n> decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public\r\n> record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only\r\n> copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding\r\n> disclosure.\r\n> Sometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from\r\n> home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts\r\n> (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on\r\n> those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned,\r\n> used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's\r\n> employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were\r\n> \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are\r\n> \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and\r\n> officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created,\r\n> should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask\r\n> employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention\r\n> requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders\r\n> temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also\r\n> require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work\r\n> emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency\r\n> receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or\r\n> officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the\r\n> agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any\r\n> responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the\r\n> request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in\r\n> agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be\r\n> required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and\r\n> extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records\r\n> located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account,\r\n> and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to\r\n> show the records are not public records.\r\n>\r\n> View request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems\r\n> here:\r\n>\r\n> https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fvancouver-public-schools-district-29069%252Fvancouver-public-schools-district-agency-costs-fulfilling-public-records-requests-including-litigation-2019-2022-missing-jlarc-reports-139654%252F%253Femail%253DJen.Anderson%252540vansd.org&url_auth_token=AAEh5KFDm8MGxMlkl9QaA68qMwk%3A1pdi64%3AlqoDYAr6Spm5QreYJ6nCDAXIiqLg4iXQY5OhAqZpxSI\r\n>\r\n> If prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\n> HVNNBURJ\r\n>\r\n> Filed via MuckRock.com\r\n> E-mail (Preferred): 139654-21188285@requests.muckrock.com\r\n>\r\n> PLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\n> For mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\n> MuckRock News\r\n> DEPT MR 139654\r\n> 263 Huntington Ave\r\n> Boston, MA 02115\r\n>\r\n> PLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is\r\n> being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share,\r\n> and manage public records requests.

The group gained notoriety in 2011/2012 for their blackhat hacking activities, which included attacks on the United Nations, NASA, NATO, Facebook and several other large corporations and government entities.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nFor emails I request production of emails in native MICROSOFT .pst (personal storage table) format which allows for a virtually infinite number of emails to be produced in a single digital file, providing for economy and convenience. If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBHS Wolverines",

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon (NOTE: please refer to this number in all correspondence regarding your request)\r\nDear Anonymous requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I acknowledge receipt of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITINGS \u2013 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL), ELECTRONIC TEXTS, TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES, AND TELEPHONE LOGS of the following individuals for the period of time between January 1, 2019 \u2013 November 2, 2021:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafa\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nClarification Questions:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your request seeks communications \u201cof\u201d the above -named individuals. Please define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals. Are you also seeking records \u201cto\u201d the above-named persons? Are you seeking communications on which the above persons were cc\u2019d?\r\n  2.  I assume you intended to refer to School Board Member Sima Sarrafan. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n  3.  It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

When you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cfrom\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cto\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201ccopied to\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nTo give you a sense of the volume of records you have requested, searches of potentially responsive records for the following persons for the first six-month period, 05 01 21 through 11 02 21, returned the following numbers of potentially responsive messages to be reviewed and processed for production to you:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran                                                                   8420\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis                                                                      7245\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas              25,244\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn     13.443\r\nTotal for these 4 individuals, 05 01 21-11 02 21:                                  53,952\r\n\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 01 21-10 14 21. This is roughly the first half of the month of October 2021, consisting of 446 messages. The period 10 15 21-11 02 21 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records. Please click the link below to retrieve the following records:\r\nNOTE: I am having technical difficulties creating this link. I will complete this process as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A. Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\n425-456-4101\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>",

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.  On November 14, 2022, the District received the following public records request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021.

The District has assigned this request the number R000176-111622. Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nThen on November 15, 2022, the District received another records request from you.  In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

The District has assigned it the number R000177-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAgain, the District is currently working on providing you with all responsive records to your original request. Richland School District Policy 4040 \u2013 Public Records Request provides in part, \u201cWhen the same requester simultaneously submits multiple, separate requests or makes one or more additional requests when previous requests are open, the District may queue the requests in the order in which they were received. The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Good Morning:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District received your records request on November 16th.  The District acknowledged the request on November 17th.  At the time, the District believed your request to be from an organization named Muckrock.  As previously explained, the District had received several requests from Muckrock.  As such, the District was answering the requests in the order that they were received.  The District now understands that you are an individual making a public records request through the Muckrock platform.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the mistake and is prioritizing your request.  You requested the following public records:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.

I should have those records in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.  The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.  I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.  This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement.\r\n\r\nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.  The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request.\r\n\r\nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.  I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.  Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.  His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.  The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.  His work e-mail address is Jason Crouch RHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:RHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nRick Kane is the SRO assigned to Hanford High School. Hanford High School\u2019s address is 450 Hanford Street, Richland Washington, 99354. His work telephone number is 509-967-6521. Officer Kane\u2019s work e-mail address is Rick Kane HHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:HHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nThe District did have an SRO at Enterprise Middle School a number of years ago.  West Richland Office Nick Letourneau has not been assigned to the West Richland school for at least two years.  The District is researching the officer\u2019s date of departure.\r\n\r\nAgain, the District apologizes for the mistake and the delay in getting the responsive records to you. We are prioritizing your request and will be providing you with installments of responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI, on behalf of New York Focus, am requesting either you fill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSam Mellins\r\nSenior Reporter, New York Focus",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

You have submitted twenty-six separate petitions to the Supervisor of Records and numerous other follow up communications concerning prior petitions. We have already responded to eighteen of your petitions.\r\n\r\nDue to the volume of petitions and the complexity of the issues raised, we are continuing to invoke the rule of reason and will respond to your petitions within a reasonable time period with the goal of addressing each petition within 30 days of submission. We understand you disagree with this basis. As we recently explained in response to one of your complaints with the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force, we strive to respond to petitions within the 10-day period specified in Section 67.21(d), but we don't view it as an absolute deadline. Particularly here, where the issues raised are novel and you have submitted numerous petitions over a short time period, responding within 10 days is not feasible because doing so would unreasonably impinge on our ability to perform our other responsibilities.

Your response is required by Feb 11, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).  Emails are requested in the easily-generated EML or MSG formats (SFAC 67.21(l)).\r\n\r\nI am now auditing how the City appears to unlawfully withhold the BCC recipients of emails when they print out emails in certain formats.  The identity of BCC recipients is not exempt.  BCC is not an information security record that reveals vulnerabilities or increases chance of an attack.  The BCC names was typed in by a human being and are not metadata.  You must provide BCC just like you provide To or CC recipients.  There is no legal authority to keep secret the identities of persons communicating with government officials, unless they are specifically confidential informants and such.  If you withhold the BCC names, I will file complaints, separate and apart from email metadata complaints (which I have now already won, see ruling in SOTF 19044).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations: All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27). All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.  \r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\n1. An exact copy with all email headers (incl. but not limited to the BCC identities), attachments, color, formatting, hyperlinks, images, and all other parts of the record of the most recent 5 emails which have any BCC recipients which were sent by your Dept Head on any government account . Note that you will have to search directly from the person's computer or account in their Sent folder specifically (In many email systems, no other method will allow you to see the BCC recipients).  In modern Outlook systems, the search query is as follows: (bcc:*)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses.

        "communication": "Sheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department:\r\n\r\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars.  See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 .  On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that \r\n\r\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott.  If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation.\r\n\r\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive).\r\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning.  Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested.  Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office):  https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf \r\n\r\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt.  Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified.  You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety.  Please ensure you actually do your duty.\r\n\r\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time:\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted.   You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence.  They are *his* calendars.   And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part.  First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror.  Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations.  You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter.\r\n\r\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt).  You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

        "communication": "Sheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department:\r\n\r\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars. See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 . On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that\r\n\r\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott. If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation.\r\n\r\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive).\r\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning. Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested. Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office): https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf\r\n\r\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt. Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified. You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety. Please ensure you actually do your duty.\r\n\r\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time:\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted. You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence. They are *his* calendars. And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part. First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror. Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations. You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter.\r\n\r\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt). You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \n\n \nRE: Public Records Request of September 23, 2020, Reference # P000054-092420 \nDear Anonymous, \nThis email follows up the message sent to you on October 26, 2020. The Sheriff's Office will provide records to you on November 5, 2020. \nYour request received on September 23, 2020, was as follows: <sfso.foia@sfgov.org>September 23, 2020 \n\nThis is a follow up to request number SOTF 19143: \n\nSheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department: \n\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request. \n\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars. See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 . On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that \n\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott. If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation. \n\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready. \n\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive). \n\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning. Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested. Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office): https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf \n\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt. Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified. You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety. Please ensure you actually do your duty. \n\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time: \n\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted. You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters. \n\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record. \n\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence. They are *his* calendars. And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names. \n\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure. \n\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part. First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror. Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations. You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter. \n\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt). You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616 \n\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose. \n\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure. \n\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.
