As you will see from our response in Item A above, PSC had no instruction, training or policies requiring any action by the College.  For that reason, there are no documents responsive to Item 1 in your request because no action was taken and no internal communication or documents were generated.\r\n\r\n2.  Our president's email in Item C above is the only document related to item 2 in your request.  I did not provide copies of the emails received by the other two vice-presidents because they are duplicates of the one provided.\r\n\r\n3.  The spreadsheet and email in Items A and B above are the only documents related to PSC's response.\r\n\r\nThis email concludes our response to your public records request.

Your original request was filtered into our spam inbox, so thank you for following up.\r\n\r\nI have attached KSU\u2019s Campus-Wide Sponsorship Agreement with The Coca-Cola Company. I anticipate that I will be able to provide additional responsive documents, if any, by the close of business on Friday, February 3rd.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

Your request has been received and is being processed in accordance with the California Public Records Act. Your request was received in this office on 11/2/2022 and given the\u00a0reference number P000341-110222 for tracking purposes. \r\nRecords Requested: Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News.\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4.

With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDave Maass \r\nDirector of Investigations \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsutter-county-sheriffs-office-5367%252Fautomated-license-plate-readers-sutter-county-sheriffs-office-136081%252F%253Femail%253Dscsorecords%252540co.sutter.ca.us&url_auth_token=AAA1DCQ8Kcmb5zrk37w2_iRixAU%3A1oqQGo%3Afu9DaRAxZvu0dA0XcqE4y106X9vT41PY6pkJeZhXy9g\u201d The County has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \nYour request has been assigned reference number 2020-ICFO-64605. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.

        "communication": "Dear Tom Nash:\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS), Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE) is responding to your request received on January 19, 2023, made in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requesting the following information.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Does DCSE collect any fees related to servicing the incarcerated youth?\r\n\r\nDCSE is responsible for establishing paternity as well as establishing, modifying, enforcing, and collecting child support obligations. See Va. Code \u00a7 63.2-100 (defining child support services). Prior to July 1, 2021, the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) would apply for child support services when a child was placed in custody. DJJ no longer applies for services on new placements, but DCSE continues to collect arrearages due prior to July 1, 2021. Pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 63.2-1904, DCSE charges a $35 annual fee on DJJ cases. DCSE deducts that fee from additional child support collections after having first collected and disbursed at least $550 during the federal fiscal year. Fees that we may collect directly from a parent, such as the cost of genetic testing, are the result of our mission as the child support agency and are not related to the services being provided to the justice-involved youth. For a full discussion of child support fees, see Chapter 11, Section 10 of our Program Manual, available to the public at https://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/dcse/program_manual/Program_Manual.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  All reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed to this department or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of youths (i.e., juveniles) charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nDCSE is responsible for the establishment and collection of child support obligations, some of which are payable to DJJ.  Those obligations are set according to the child support guidelines and are unrelated to the costs assessed for care. DCSE does not track medical or room and board costs for justice-involved youth.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nS.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

We received your email requesting clarification\r\nabout our methodology in responding to your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we detailed to you in a previous communication, many of our public\r\nrecords requests concern students and staff. We have approximately 136\r\npublic records requests that are responsive to your request that require 3rd\r\nparty notification related to hundreds of people.\r\n                                           2020-2021- 28 requests require 3\r\nrd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2018-2019 \u2013 13\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2012-2017 \u2013 95\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7       With our last installment, we have provided to you, in reverse\r\nchronological order, all requests for records covering 2012-2021 that do\r\nnot require 3rd party notification.  Next we will be providing non-exempt\r\nrecords responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\u00b7       After those installments, we will move on to the requests that\r\nrequire 3rd party notification, allowing time for affected parties to seek\r\ninjunctions if they so choose.  Absent injunctions, we will then provide\r\nnon-exempt records responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our responsive records are available electronically, but many from\r\n2012 \u2013 2017 are in paper form and will need to be scanned into PDFs.\r\nEmails are printed and then scanned to PDF for production.  We are making\r\nsteady progress in fulfilling your request but are unable to give an exact\r\ndate when the request will be completed in full.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiana S.

If a person does not possess photo identification, then the governmental entity may require other forms of identification evidencing the person's residency in this state.\" You will need to provide a government issued photo ID or if you not possess one please contact me to discuss alternatives.\r\n\r\nI have also attached our adopted public records request form which I respectfully ask you to complete to indicate the maximum charge you are willing to incur, if any, without further consultation with the City. There is no charge for the first hour of labor to produce requested records, however labor will be charged for any time beyond the first hour. Based on the search terms under Item 6, there are 1,621 emails that need to be reviewed. I am estimating it could take up to 16 hours at the most to complete this request. At a rate of $29.64 per hour for 15 hours, this would result in a maximum charge of $444.60.\r\n\r\nOnce these issues have been addressed the City will fulfill the request in accordance with the Tennessee Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nAngie Marshall, MMC\r\nCity Clerk/Deputy City Recorder\r\nCity of Kingsport, Tennessee\r\nP: 423-229-9384\r\nF: 423-224-2832\r\nangiemarshall@kingsporttn.gov<mailto:angiemarshall@kingsporttn.gov>\r\n[kingsport_Logo_72 - email sig]\n415 Broad Street\r\nKingsport, TN 37660\r\nwww.kingsporttn.gov<http://www.kingsporttn.gov/>\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D8EDF5.208ECEB0]\r\nRegion V Director 2021 - 2024",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning the NXIVM cult, which engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and racketeering, while claiming to be a multi-level marketing company.\r\n\r\nBased in Clifton Park, New York, a suburb of Albany, the group claimed to offer personal and professional development seminars through its \"Executive Success Programs\" of large-group awareness training. The company has been widely described as a cult[4] and was shown in court to have been a recruiting platform for a secret society called \"DOS\" in which women were branded and forced into sexual slavery.\r\n\r\nIn early 2018, NXIVM's founder, Keith Raniere, and his associate, actress Allison Mack, were arrested and indicted on federal charges related to DOS, including sex trafficking. Others associated with NXIVM were also charged with federal crimes. As of April 2019, five people associated with NXIVM\u2014Mack, NXIVM co-founder Nancy Salzman, Lauren Salzman, Seagram heiress Clare Bronfman, and bookkeeper Kathy Russell\u2014had pleaded guilty to various charges. Raniere was convicted in federal court of sex trafficking and racketeering on June 19, 2019. On September 30, 2020, Clare Bronfman became the first defendant sentenced in the case, when she was ordered to serve six years and nine months in federal prison.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nEmma North-Best",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records relating to or mentioning the NXIVM cult, which engaged in sex\r\n    trafficking, forced labor and racketeering, while claiming to be a\r\n    multi-level marketing company.\r\n    \r\n    Based in Clifton Park, New York, a suburb of Albany, the group claimed to\r\n    offer personal and professional development seminars through its \"Executive\r\n    Success Programs\" of large-group awareness training.

This email is also to provide a status update.\r\n\r\nWe assigned your request log number 20-00012. Please refer to this log number when corresponding with us about this request.\r\n\r\nYou requested copies of any reports, memos, or briefings regarding 19 listed OIG investigations.  I didn't recognize three of the investigation numbers (left column below) in your list. That appears to be a result of transcription error. I believe that the correct numbers for those three investigations of interest are listed in the right column below. Please clarify if that is not a correct interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\nNot recognized\r\nInvestigation\r\nNumbers\r\n\r\nPresumed\r\nInvestigations\r\nof Interest\r\n\r\nCH2430081\r\n\r\nCH24340081\r\n\r\nHQ420100001\r\n\r\nHQ42010001\r\n\r\nS03010132\r\n\r\nSF03010132\r\n\r\n\r\nOIG has a backlog of FOIA requests, and we process requests on a first-in, first-out basis using \"multi-tracks.\" There are four tracks: an expedited track, if the request qualifies; a simple track for relatively simple requests; a complex track for more complex and lengthy requests; and a remanded track, when a FOIA appeal is granted. Your request for records will involve OIG in a time-consuming search and a lengthy review process. We will need to involve regional offices in the search and gather documents from them. Your request is currently in the \"complex track,\" and we estimate it will be completed by April 30, 2020.\r\n\r\nPlease respond if you wish to limit the scope of your request. For example, narrowing the scope to a request for a record identifying the category of allegation of each of the listed investigations would place your request in the simple track.\r\n\r\nAlso, please feel free to contact me If you have any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMichael A.

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 138 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 571 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,289 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,649 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nF: (540) 868-4391\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I will not use GOV QA.\r\n2. Your agency will produce the identified requested public records via email.\r\n\r\nYou now have the option to either:\r\n\r\na. produce the requested public records,\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nb. silently withhold the public records and deny the records request.\r\n\r\nYou do not have the option of argument, or debate. My position is your agency is legally bound to provide the records via email (RCW 42.56.080).\r\n\r\nThe burden of proof shall be on your agency to establish that refusal to permit copying of these public records is in accordance with statute that exempts or prohibits disclosure in whole or in part of the records.\r\n\r\nBasically your argument would be... \"Highline Public Schools District REFUSES to use email to produce public records, because we don't want to.\" \r\n\r\nSure. Good luck with that.\r\n\r\nYou dont need to be reminded you are a public employee do you? Public.

Please note that the Department has redacted portions of the document consist of personal information such as names, phone numbers, license plates, and email addresses that have been submitted via the Department's Autonomous Vehicles Incident Form.  The Department has determined the disclosure of such information would be an infringement on the privacy of such individuals, and the redaction is necessary to preserve the public's willingness to provide such information to the Department, which may assist the Department in its task of regulating autonomous vehicle manufacturers.  (Please also see the Information Practices Act, Civil Code section 1798 et seq.; the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, Public Law 103-322, 18 U.S.C. sections 2721-2725; and the Right of Privacy under the California Constitution, Article I, Section 1.)  As such, the Department has determined the public interest in withholding these records outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  As required by the California Public Records Act, the person responsible for the determination to withhold responsive records pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000 is Miguel Acosta, Chief of the Autonomous Vehicles Branch, Policy Division, of the Department of Motor Vehicles.

This includes photos by employees as part of their work on this official mission, or photos by third party contractors.\r\n\r\n2 - Any contracts or agreements with Phoenix Air to supply their services for the mission to transport Ebola blood samples from Liberia to the US towards the end of 2016 (signed by any institution such as CDC, DTRA, NIH, etc). I'm sure you'll have a copy of that.\r\n\r\n3 -  Any contracts or agreements with Sandia that you have at hand from 01 July 2013 and today regarding their work in Liberia (signed by any institution such as CDC, DTRA, NIH, etc).  I'm sure you'll have a copy of that.\r\n\r\n4 - Any Chain of Custody documents signed for the shipping of any Ebola blood samples from Liberia to the USA between 01/01/16 and 31 December 17. The staff responsible for the sample management at the CDC and NIH will have a copy of that.\r\n\r\n5 - Any documents with information linked to blood samples that were transported from Liberia to the US  from 01/01/17 to 01/11/17 (e.g. the name of the patient, their origin, their gender, their clinical signs etc). I do not require individual documents as I understand that the private information of patients cannot be disclosed. Please feel free to redact that personal information from any documents that contain lists. In case there are many documents that pertain to single individuals with the sample templates, then please provide one of each of the types of documents as a template.\r\n\r\n6 - The agreement between Liberia and the US (signed by the Ambassador of the US in Liberia) signed around September 2016 for the transport of Ebola blood samples from Liberia to the US.\r\n\r\n7 - Any inventory of Ebola blood samples held by the US that were brought from Liberia, including samples held at Fort Detrick and Rocky Mountain Lab.\r\n\r\nThis request should be properly classified as a media request. I am a freelance investigative reporter covering covering East and Central Africa, with a particular focus on business, corruption, natural resources, land and social issues.\r\n\r\nI have a strong likelihood of publishing news articles based on information released in response to this request. I have previously been published in Le Monde Afrique, IRIN News, Sydney Morning Herald, African Arguments and others. If you have questions about my media classification, please let me know and I'm happy to address them.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filed electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not, and I would like text-searchable documents.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nEmmanuel Freudenthal",

Considering that you have been provided very clear search terms, namely:\r\n\r\n\"VAERS\" AND (\"221579-1\" OR \"221579\" or \"hulk\"), not case sensitive\r\n\r\na search of the relevant accounts ought to be feasible. \r\n\r\nI respectfully disagree with your request to identify individuals within DHHS/CDC/DDID/NCEZID/DHQP/OIS whose accounts are more likely to be responsible. OIS is already a fairly small unit. The employees of this functional unit, and their functions, are not publicly identified in an accessible manner (viz. the HHS directory, which cannot be searched by acronym). To require a citizen to identify who was in a particular subdepartment of a federal agency almost two decades ago when such staff lists are not readily available essentially obviates the right to freedom of information. It renders the notion of governmental accountability moot, concealing it behind a curtain of \"burdensomeness\". To the best of my understanding, there are fewer than 200 e-mail accounts that will be responsive, and it should be within the CDC's power to identify these with respect to the time frame I provided.\r\n\r\nWith very best wishes\r\n",
