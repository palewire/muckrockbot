As you say, \"Allegheny County Sheriff\u2019s Office utilizes a large array of policies that guide its operations...\" These are the policies which are being sought\u2014those which guide police operations. For example, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police publishes a \"manual of procedural orders\", which presumably does not contain information that would be excepted from disclosure under right-to-know law. https://pittsburghpa.gov/police/manual-procedural-orders\r\n\r\n2. The intention of requesting records from the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office was to obtain records in custody the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office, and not from other agencies. I will be sure to adjust the language of future requests.\r\n\r\n3. Certainly, I do not wish to endanger the Office's computer security or ongoing investigations. I believe the Office is well within its rights to redact or omit records which are excepted from disclosure. Please proceed with the request by supplying those policies which are not excepted.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJosh Chamberlain",

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or\r\n    transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer\r\n    slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or\r\n    describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to\r\n    confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If\r\n    previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release\r\n    consisting of those records while additional records are located and\r\n    processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Paul Galante\r\n    \r\n    Upload documents directly:\r\n    https://https://www.muckrock.comhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?url_auth_token=AAAj2MnNxOre1oSHteLnfMK20oc%3A1jfb8A%3AJzAU_EBvjUtt6QkLCHw05GuHJRQ&next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ffederal-bureau-of-investigation-10%252Fsocap-93993%252F%253Femail%253Defoia%252540subscriptions.fbi.gov\r\n\r\n** \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

Currently, simple track cases average approximately 98 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 947 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,011 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,360 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

FOIAcomplaince@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 22-V.E.MUCK. NARA FOIA Request and Appeals Case Processing Logs FY 2022 . [See PDF for full FOIA Request]\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking via Muckrock.com:\r\n\r\n1.\tNARA\u2019s FY 2022 FOIA Operational Records FOIA Requests and Appeals FOIA Processing Logs. [NARA purports that it maintains separate FOIA units, one of which is \"Operational Records,\" cited as a sub agency in FOIAonline.gov.]\r\na.\tThe FOIA Advisory Committee, approved Tech Committee Recommendation No. 2022-TS3 (Part 2) \u201cPosting FOIA Logs\u201d states:\r\n \r\n\u201cWe recommend that agencies proactively publish FOIA logs in the agency\u2019s electronic reading room (often referred to as FOIA Libraries) on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs.\r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields  in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF:\r\na)\tTracking number of the request [or appeal].\r\nb)\tDate of the request [or appeal].\r\nc)\tName of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs.\r\nd)\tOrganizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request [or appeal].\r\ne)\tWhether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well.\r\nf)\tSubject matter of the request [or appeal]..\r\ng)\tStatus of the request [or appeal] (pending, closed, etc.).\r\nh)\tFor requests [or appeals].that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request [or appeal] (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni)\tFee Information\r\na.\tFee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news media, other).\r\nb.\tWhether a fee waiver was requested.\r\nc.\tIf a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted.\r\nd.\tAmount of fees charged.\r\ne.\tAmount of fees paid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com.\r\n\r\nI am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. \r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field in FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination.\r\n1.\tThe  subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na.\tThe next and final FOIA Advisory Committee of the 2020 \u2013 2022 Term is June 9, 2022, where this matter will be discussed. This is the final term of this committee\r\nb.\tBased on records released regarding individualized tracking numbers, status and estimated completion dates of my FOIA requests and appeals, NARA may be engaging in massive false FOIA reporting. There can be no dispute  that such matters are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\nc.\tPlease refer further to my FOIA Public Comments regarding the March 29, 2022 Senate Oversight Committee FOIA Hearings, wherein DOJ OIP and NARA\u2019s OGIS were slammed for lack of FOIA compliance oversight. \r\nd.\tI plan to distribute information from this expedited FOIA request to members of the media and others via a vast distribution network.\r\ne.\tI am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media.\r\n\r\n2.\tInformation is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na.\tSee paragraph 1 above incorporated fully herein..\r\nb.\tI am recognized within to FOIA Advisory Committee Recommendation \u201cOGIS 2.0: Reimagining FOIA Oversight\u201d dated 05.04.2022 as an expert contributor \u201cRobert (Bob) Hammond, Citizen FOIA Advocate.\u201d\r\n3.\tIn any denial of expedited processing, NARA must repeat each paragraph and sub-paragraph above and state explicitly how my request does not meet the cited standards. A blanket statement without doing so lacks required content.\r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification  as to how my request stated herein does not qualify.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Hammond",

FOIA Join the fight for FOIA compliance. FOIAcomplaince@gmail.com) \r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 22-V.E.MUCK. NARA FOIA Request and Appeals Case Processing Logs FY 2022 . [See PDF for full FOIA Request] \r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking via Muckrock.com: \r\n\r\n1. NARA\u2019s FY 2022 FOIA Operational Records FOIA Requests and Appeals FOIA Processing Logs. [NARA purports that it maintains separate FOIA units, one of which is \"Operational Records,\" cited as a sub agency in FOIAonline.gov.] \r\na. The FOIA Advisory Committee, approved Tech Committee Recommendation No. 2022-TS3 (Part 2) \u201cPosting FOIA Logs\u201d states: \r\n\r\n\u201cWe recommend that agencies proactively publish FOIA logs in the agency\u2019s electronic reading room (often referred to as FOIA Libraries) on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs. \r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF: \r\na) Tracking number of the request [or appeal]. \r\nb) Date of the request [or appeal]. \r\nc) Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs. \r\nd) Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request [or appeal]. \r\ne) Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well. \r\nf) Subject matter of the request [or appeal].. \r\ng) Status of the request [or appeal] (pending, closed, etc.). \r\nh) For requests [or appeals].that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request [or appeal] (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.). \r\ni) Fee Information \r\na. Fee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news media, other). \r\nb. Whether a fee waiver was requested. \r\nc. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted. \r\nd. Amount of fees charged. \r\ne. Amount of fees paid.\u201d \r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com. \r\n\r\nI am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request. \r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. \r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field in FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination. \r\n1. The subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na. The next and final FOIA Advisory Committee of the 2020 \u2013 2022 Term is June 9, 2022, where this matter will be discussed. This is the final term of this committee \r\nb. Based on records released regarding individualized tracking numbers, status and estimated completion dates of my FOIA requests and appeals, NARA may be engaging in massive false FOIA reporting. There can be no dispute that such matters are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\nc. Please refer further to my FOIA Public Comments regarding the March 29, 2022 Senate Oversight Committee FOIA Hearings, wherein DOJ OIP and NARA\u2019s OGIS were slammed for lack of FOIA compliance oversight. \r\nd. I plan to distribute information from this expedited FOIA request to members of the media and others via a vast distribution network. \r\ne. I am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media. \r\n\r\n2. Information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na. See paragraph 1 above incorporated fully herein.. \r\nb. I am recognized within to FOIA Advisory Committee Recommendation \u201cOGIS 2.0: Reimagining FOIA Oversight\u201d dated 05.04.2022 as an expert contributor \u201cRobert (Bob) Hammond, Citizen FOIA Advocate.\u201d \r\n3. In any denial of expedited processing, NARA must repeat each paragraph and sub-paragraph above and state explicitly how my request does not meet the cited standards. A blanket statement without doing so lacks required content. \r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification as to how my request stated herein does not qualify. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRobert Hammond \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/perseverance2013/109300/NARA_22-V.D.MUCK._NARA_FOIA_Request_and_Appeals_Logs_FY_22.pdf \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnational-archives-and-records-administration-129%252Fexpedited-foia-request-nara-22-vamuck-nara-foia-request-and-appeals-case-processing-logs-fy-22-129755%252F%253Femail%253Dadmin%252540foiaonline.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj2tdGHKX1-c-t6oDvxXcze3A%3A1ny6JM%3AJqyIxkt9Y6CPxP8sBVKZMGXJbTaOgLj-y-AaEORQmmc",

Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs.\r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF:\r\na) Tracking number of the request [or appeal].\r\nb) Date of the request [or appeal].\r\nc) Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs.\r\nd) Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request [or appeal].\r\ne) Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well.\r\nf) Subject matter of the request [or appeal]..\r\ng) Status of the request [or appeal] (pending, closed, etc.).\r\nh) For requests [or appeals].that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request [or appeal] (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni) Fee Information\r\na. Fee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news media, other).\r\nb. Whether a fee waiver was requested.\r\nc. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted.\r\nd. Amount of fees charged.\r\ne. Amount of fees paid.\u201d",

        "communication": "Good morning Mrs. Haskins,\r\n\r\nPrior to processing your request, could you re-look at the search parameters you have provided?  Region 3 includes New Mexico and Arizona, so while we can search for records related to the Sawmill Fire, we will not have records related to the Paradise Fire which occurred recently in CA.   For expediency, could you please let us know which offices you would like to have search for records?  Are you requesting that we have all the employees in Region 3 conduct an email search?  Limit the search to employees involved in the investigation and/or those who work in the Coronado National Forest that were affected by the fire?  Are you wanting records related to FS efforts in fighting the fire?  Are you interested in the records related to the numerous FOIA requests for the video?  The more specific you are in describing exactly which records you are interested in, and which offices you want to conduct the search, the faster and more accurately we will be able to provide the documents you are requesting.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA specifies two requirements for a request for records to be considered a valid, \u201cperfected\u201d request:  (1) It must \u201creasonably describe\u201d the records requested and (2) it must be made in accordance with the agency\u2019s published FOIA regulations.  After careful review of your FOIA request, the Forest Service has determined that your request does not specifically identify the records which you are seeking.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  See 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.5(b), and Forest Service Handbook 6209.13.  Where possible, a requester should supply specific information regarding dates, titles, names of individuals, names of offices, and name of agencies or organizations that may help identify the records.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.\r\n\r\nIn the event that we do not hear from you within 20 business days from the date of this email, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns related to the processing you\u2019re your request, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlisha\n",

In your email below, you indicated that your request was submitted in November 2018, however according to our records, your request (2024-APHIS-03699-F) was dated and received in our office (USDA/APHIS) on January 31, 2024. This request seeks information on Neuralink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Your 2018 email threads below indicate that you filed a request with U.S. Forest Service regarding documents related to the Sawmill Fire in Arizona sparked by a gender-reveal party involving use of explosives on federal land. U.S Forest Service is a different agency than USDA/APHIS therefore you will need to follow up with US Forest Service regarding documents related to the Sawmill Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  If the USDA/APHIS was involved with a federal response to the Sawmill Fire, it is not related to the current FOIA Request (2024-APHIS-03699-F).  Please follow up with the correct analyst who may have a related FOIA Request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Lastly, your request (2024-APHIS-03699-F) was transferred to a new analyst, Shane Stonesifer. He can be contacted at shane.stonesifer@usda.gov<mailto:shane.stonesifer@usda.gov>. Going forward, please direct any future inquiries on this request to analyst Stonesifer.\nRegards,\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAFDE1.88A75EB0]\r\nMaria E.

The project is a project of Collier Enterprises, and it is applying for a 404 permit form the state of Florida, per the Army Corpss delegation of 404 permitting authority to the state. The terms of that programmatic consultation that allowed the state of Florida to assume 404 authority required that FWS to conduct technical reviews and assistance to projects seeking 404 permits in order to ensure that they are in compliance with ESA Section 7. I wish to obtain records from FWS concerning its technical review and assistance as it relates to the Bellmar project. The Vero Beach office is likely the FWS office leading this review, along side FWS's Florida leadership team. Key FWS officials whose records to search for include Florida state leadership like Larry Williams and Robert Carey, as well as Jose Rivera at the Vero Beach Office.  \r\n\r\nThis request seeks records produced since January 1, 2023. \r\n\r\nI am a reporter for The Florida Center for Government Accountability and other outlets.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias",

For example, you may find her New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/beverly-lahaye-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/28/us/prentice-marshall-77-federal-judge-dies.html.

This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.

Such details may include the subject, timeframe, names of any individuals involved ... \"\r\n\r\nMy request asked for any records related the \"Belarusian Cyber Partisans,\" or the \"Cyber Partisans,\" which refers to a narrow and specific group and/or subject. I also specifically asked for \"any records - memos, emails, text messages, images or other material,\" which seems to be a clear and reasonable description of possible search options.  \r\n\r\nTherefore I believe that I very narrowly constructed my request to a limited number of records that would relate to the stated subject. It is inappropriate for this agency to issue such a letter so quickly after receiving the request. Please instruct the FOIA officers to complete a search for records before making such a determination.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of good faith, the only thing I neglected to add was a time frame. Please search for material dated between Jan. 1, 2020 and May 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAJ Vicens",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing John \"Sonny\"\r\n    Franzese Sr. (February 6, 1917 \u2013 February 24, 2020), who was an\r\n    Italian-American mobster who was a longtime member of the Colombo crime\r\n    family.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/us/politics/joseph-i-lieberman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?
