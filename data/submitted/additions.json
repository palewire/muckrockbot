LEGAL BASIS AND PRECEDENT\r\nThis request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552 and is supported by the following legal authorities and judicial precedents, which mandate exhaustive and complete searches for all relevant documents:\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice v.

Federal Trade Commission, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and Carney v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814 (2d Cir. 1994), support fee waivers for requests that enhance governmental transparency.\r\nIf fees are expected to exceed $100, please contact me prior to proceeding further.\r\n\r\nVII.

PRESERVATION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nI require that all potentially responsive records be immediately preserved. This includes ensuring that all electronic files retain their original metadata and that no automated deletion or archival processes alter or destroy the relevant records.\r\n\r\nIX. VAUGHN INDEX REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the responsive records is withheld or redacted, I request a complete Vaughn index that:\r\n\r\nLists each document withheld or redacted with specificity.\r\nIdentifies the exact statutory exemption(s) claimed.\r\nProvides a detailed explanation of how each exemption justifies the withholding, including an analysis of the potential harm from disclosure.\r\nDiscloses any segregable portions that can be released.\r\n\r\nX.

PREVIOUS EVIDENCE OF INTERACTION\r\n\r\nThere is extensive, independently documented evidence of interactions between U.S. Border Patrol personnel and militia groups. Specifically:\r\n\r\nSouthern Poverty Law Center Report: In Plain Sight: Uncovering Border Patrol\u2019s Relationship with Far-Right Militias at the Southern Border (\u200b\r\nSPLCENTER.ORG\r\n) details multiple instances of such interactions in Arizona.\r\nWIRED Report: Border Militias Prepare to Assist With Donald Trump\u2019s Mass Deportation Plans (\u200b\r\nWIRED.COM\r\n) describes contacts between militia groups like Arizona Border Recon and federal officials.\r\nAdditional Investigative Reports: Articles from the Los Angeles Times and TIME (\u200b\r\nLATIMES.COM\r\n; \r\nTIME.COM\r\n) corroborate historical and ongoing patterns of informal cooperation or tacit approval between Border Patrol personnel, local law enforcement, and vigilante groups.\r\nThese independent sources establish a clear pattern of interaction that underscores the public interest in obtaining full disclosure of the requested records.\r\n\r\nXIII. SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTATION AND SUBSTATION RECORDS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records explicitly described above, please produce any supplementary or \u201csubstation\u201d records that are relevant to the processing of this request.

If any portion of this request is unclear or if additional information is required, please contact me immediately. I further request that no delay tactics or improper denials be employed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt, full, and legally compliant disclosure of these records.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",
