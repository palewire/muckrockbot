Detailed Staffing Records: Records of staffing levels within the department responsible for handling FOIL requests from January 1, 2019, to present, including any changes in staffing levels.\r\n\r\n2. FOIL Request Logs: Logs or records of all FOIL requests received by the department from January 1, 2019, to present, including dates of receipt, nature of requests, and status of each request.\r\n\r\n3. Correspondence on Staffing and Resource Allocation: Internal and external correspondence and memos related to staffing levels, resource allocation, and challenges in handling FOIL requests from January 1, 2019, to present.\r\n\r\n4. Requests for Additional Staff or Resources: Formal requests made by the department or Records Access Officer for additional staffing or resources to handle FOIL requests, including responses to these requests, from January 1, 2019, to present.\r\n\r\n5. Policies and Procedures: A copy of the current policies and procedures for handling and responding to FOIL requests, including guidelines for timelines and prioritization of requests.\r\n\r\n6. Training Records: Records of any training provided to staff responsible for handling FOIL requests from January 1, 2019, to present.\r\n\r\n7. Performance Reviews or Evaluations: Performance reviews or evaluations of the Records Access Officer and staff responsible for handling FOIL requests.\r\n\r\n8. Aggregated Analysis of All FOIL Requests: An analysis of all FOIL requests made to the district, including the context, days outstanding, reasons cited for delays or non-compliance, and overall timeline and pattern of responses or lack thereof.\r\n\r\nThis request is made in the public interest to assess the efficacy and transparency of the Niskayuna Central School District in responding to FOIL requests.\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing:\r\nBased on an aggregated analysis of FOIL requests made to the Niskayuna Central School District, as documented on MuckRock, there is a concerning pattern of delayed and non-responsive FOIL requests. Several requests, including inquiries about district communications, policies, and administrative records, have remained pending or under appeal for extended periods, with the district frequently citing staffing issues and the volume of requests as reasons for delay. This pattern raises serious concerns about whether the district is intentionally avoiding responses or failing to manage staffing effectively to meet its regulatory and legal obligations under FOIL. Given this context, there is a compelling need for expedited processing of this FOIL request to ensure transparency and accountability in the district's handling of public information requests.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
