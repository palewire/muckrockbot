According to reports, during this incident, Officer McWilliams was overpowered by a suspect who seized the officer\u2019s firearm and discharged one round, grazing Officer McWilliams. A passing bystander, an unidentified 34-year-old man, intervened and assisted in subduing the suspect until backup officers arrived. Police body camera footage reportedly shows the bystander tackling the assailant from behind at a critical moment.

While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and community interactions.

On this date, a group of teenagers reportedly engaged in disruptive activities inspired by a TikTok \"milk crate\" challenge, which escalated into a public disturbance. Actions included throwing milk jugs, entering a live lobster tank, and defying store security. Upon police arrival, the teenagers allegedly used profane language and refused orders to disperse, necessitating backup units. Seven juveniles, aged 14\u201317, were arrested on charges including rioting, criminal mischief, and battery on officers, following physical altercations where some teens reportedly kicked at police officers.\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nIncident Reports: Complete reports detailing the events, actions taken by officers, and charges filed against the individuals involved.\r\nArrest Records: Documentation pertaining to the arrests of the seven juveniles, including arrest affidavits and booking information.\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: All available footage from officers responding to the incident, capturing interactions with the individuals involved and the actions taken during the event.\r\nDash Camera Footage: Any available footage from patrol vehicles at the scene, particularly those capturing the exterior of the Kroger store and the arrival/departure of law enforcement units.\r\nSurveillance Footage: Copies of the store's surveillance videos that recorded the incident, if obtained by law enforcement as part of the investigation.\r\n911 Call Records: Audio recordings and transcripts of all emergency calls related to the incident, including initial reports from store employees or patrons.\r\nDispatch Logs: Records of communications between dispatch and responding officers, including timestamps and descriptions of the situation as it unfolded.\r\nUse of Force Reports: Any documentation filed due to the physical altercations between the juveniles and officers, including reports of officers being kicked or otherwise assaulted.\r\nPhotographs: Any images taken by law enforcement at the scene, including evidence of property damage, injuries, or other relevant aspects of the incident.\r\nPress Releases or Public Statements: Any official communications released by the Chatham County Sheriff's Office or Savannah Police Department regarding this incident.\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible.
