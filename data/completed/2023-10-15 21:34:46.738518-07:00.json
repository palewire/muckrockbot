Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\n1. Any lease agreement for the office described in multiple recent news reports in Los Angeles, where the USCIS's efforts to denaturalize US citizens will be focused. A Miami Herald article dated July 9, 2019 states that USCIS has opened \"an office in Los Angeles specifically to work on these [denaturalization] cases\" and that \"Staffers have been working at the new office since January 2017, which the agency says will be the central office for reviewing potential denaturalization cases.\" https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article214173489.html. The same article states that \"Ten lawyers have already been hired for that office, according to officials at the Justice Department.\" \r\n\r\n2. The record referenced in the Miami Herald article linked above that describe the \"algorithm\" used to select the \"700,000 files\" the agency is now reviewing for denaturalization. \r\n\r\n3. In addition to the records requested above, I also request records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request. If you use FOIA questionnaires or certifications completed by individual custodians or components to determine whether they possess responsive materials or to describe how they conducted searches, I also request any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive media coverage of and public attention on the administration\u2019s new denaturalization task force and efforts to denaturalize US citizens. See Scanning immigrants\u2019 old fingerprints, U.S. threatens to strip thousands of citizenship (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/scanning-immigrants-old-fingerprints-us-threatens-to-strip-thousands-of citizenship/2018/06/13/2230d8a2-6f2e-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html?utm_term=.171a50a5bf43); Trump Creates \u2018Denaturalization\u2019 Task Force to Pursue Deportation Against Thousands of U.S. Citizens (https://www.theroot.com/trump-creates-denaturalization-task-force-to-pursue-d-1827372139); Surely the Trump Administration Will Follow All the Rules When Stripping People of Citizenship (https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a22061884/denaturalization-task-force-trump-citizenship/); Trump Administration Launches Effort to Strip Citizenship From Those Suspected of Naturalization Irregularities (https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-administration-launches-denaturalization-effort-to-strip-citizenship-from-those-suspected-of-irregularities.html); APNewsBreak: US launches bid to find citizenship cheaters (https://apnews.com/1da389a535684a5f9d0da74081c242f3). This request goes directly to this action by the federal government.\r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched denaturalization issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I am quoted in a number of the articles listed above and intend to use the documents and information received in response to this request to share with the public and to write related news articles about denaturalization.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, the articles listed above describe a new task force seeking to strip citizenship from naturalized citizen based on a secret memo not yet released to the public and under a rubric that is unclear. While Cissna has said in multiple interviews he anticipates the filing of \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases, the FY2019 ICE budget states that only 855 of the fingerprint cards from Operation Janus and Operation Second Look are being considered for prosecution. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47. The original 2016 OIG report that started this process said there were 858 such cases. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2016/OIG-16-130-Sep16.pdf. Either way, the prospect that the new task force will file \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases raises serious concerns that Cissna's claims about the intentions and basis for denaturalization are being actively misstated in his interviews withe media. The FY2019 ICE budget also says the agency is looking to review 700,000 additional alien files for denaturalization, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47, while there were only 315,000 non-digitized fingerprint cards. Again, the numbers do not add up, and the notion that USCIS is planning \"thousands\" of denaturalizations while claiming all such cases arise from the mis-matched fingerprint cards is especially problematic.\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated where perhaps 700,000 US Citizens would be at risk of losing their citizenship. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the USCIS should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Hoppock\n\n",

We assigned your request tracking number ATFY22-145.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence concerning your request.\r\n\r\n           To the extent that your request requires a search in another Office, consultations with other Department of Justice components or another agency, and/or involves a voluminous amount of material, your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Accordingly, we will need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\r\n\r\nWe assign and process requests on a multitrack basis.  The time needed to complete our work on your request will depend on several factors, including the complexity of our records search, the volume and complexity of any material located, and the order of receipt of your request.  At this time, we have assigned your request to the complex track.  In an effort to speed up our process, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records. You can also agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located.  Any decision with regard to fees will be made after we determine whether fees will apply to this request.\r\n\r\nWe regret the necessity of this delay, but we assure you that your request will be processed as soon as possible. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact this Office by telephone at the above number, or you may write to the above address.  You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Wayne Foster, at the above telephone number or address to discuss any aspect of your request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (\"OGIS\") at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n                                                                                   Sincerely,\r\n\nFOIA/Privacy Act Unit\r\nAntitrust Division",

The Department of Banking is transitioning to a new online FOI management system called GovQA, accessible on the Department webpage:  https://FOI-Freedom-of-Information-Requests.

The Department is seeking to upload your request into the GovQA platform.  I am in communication with the Division responsible for managing the \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d records to which you refer, and I expect to issue a final response by September 29th at the latest, hopefully by September 21st.

Please note that the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission interprets \u2018promptly\u2019 under CGS Section 1\u201119(a), as \u201c \u2026 quickly and without undue delay, [considering] all of the factors presented by a particular request.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

In order to ensure an adequate response, your request requires clarification. We have identified an MS Excel list of 3,267 flight events which includes the following data elements: - Flight Date/Time - Flight Title (i.e. case number, if included) - Flight Description (i.e. case related or training*, etc., if included) - Takeoff Lat/Long (i.e. location) - Air Time - Air Seconds *note: most training events are blank This list includes Lat/Long so requires review of each event where there is a case number (investigation) to determine case status prior to release of the list. Open and active investigations are categorically exempt so we would not provide lat/long information. Based on current request volume and the time to review and determine each case status, we would anticipate completion of our review by April 10, 2023. If we are unable to meet this self-imposed deadline, we will let you know, and if we're able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly\u00a0do so. If, however, you're willing for us to remove the \"Takeoff Lat/Long\" column, we can provide a response much sooner. If we don't hear from you by , we will proceed with review of each individual investigation and you can expect a response by November 9, 2023 April 10, 2023. Your request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120. Please visit our and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. website PLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. RCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. WAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified,a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request. \r\nPlease reply directly to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.

This should include contracts for CCWIS or comparable systems that include predictive models as well as project descriptions for any models created in-house.\r\n\r\n2) Data dictionaries for all child welfare predictive models used by the department, including those provided by outside entities as well as in-house models. Data dictionaries are  documents commonly created for predictive models and databases. They describe the categories of data that are inputs (age, gender, etc.) and outputs (risk level, etc.) of predictive models. They are equivalent to headers on a spreadsheet, and do not include actual data.\r\n\r\n3) A list of all memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and/or data sharing agreements with state or local agencies for the provision of data that is incorporated into the department's child welfare predictive models. Should the department not maintain a list of these MOUs, I will accept copies of the MOUs themselves.\r\n\r\n4) Any differential impact assessments, validation studies, or comparable documents that describe the accuracy of child welfare predictive models used by the department. This should include any documents that describe common measures of predictive accuracy, such as area under the curve (AUC).\r\n\r\n5) All department policies, employee manuals, and guidelines describing how employees can and/or should use child welfare predictive models. \r\n\r\n6) All governance board, committee, or outside expert reviews assessing the efficacy of the department's proposed or current child welfare predictive models.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions regarding any aspect of this request, please don't hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employ involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help, and I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

I am looking for records that indicate the number of officers who responded to this incident, and, if any exist, investigative reports and body camera footage from the officers who responded.  I am also looking for any arrest reports.\r\n\r\nI request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees.

Therefore, we have forwarded it to\r\nour *Office of Research Services, Special Access and FOIA* (RF) staff who\r\nhandle FOIA requests for such archival records.\r\n\r\nSince *Research Services* does not process FOIA requests through\r\n*FOIAOnline*, we removed your request from the *FOIAOnline* website.  *Special\r\nAccess *staff will assign you a new tracking number, and respond directly\r\nto you.

Your request was received in this office on May 11,\r\n2021 and assigned FOIA tracking number 65692, interim tracking number\r\nRF-737.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to FBI file numbers 100-HQ-440363, 100-WF-41792,\r\n100-HQ-344527, 62-HQ-107350, and/or 100-NY-164641 on Gavin Hall MacFayden.\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that Gavin Hall MacFayden is the subject of\r\n   100-NY-164641, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation, created\r\n   between November 1968 and March 1990, and consisting of an estimated 13\r\n   pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that the Socialist Youth League is the subject\r\n   of 100-HQ-344527, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation, created\r\n   between March 1941 and September 1973, and consisting of an estimated 9,000\r\n   pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that Women Strike Force is the subject of\r\n   62-HQ-107350, compiled as part of an administrative inquiry\r\n   investigation, created between October 1961 and January 1978, and\r\n   consisting of an estimated 16,000 pages\r\n\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under the\r\nFOIA <https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine>:\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimated total page count for your request is 25,013 pages. Requests\r\nthat exceed 3,000 pages are assigned to our third-tier processing queue.\r\nYou will receive a response in partial fulfillment of your request after we\r\nhave completed the first increment. We will provide you with an update on\r\nthe status of your request and an estimated completion date at that time.\r\nTo give you an indication of our existing third-tier backlog, we are\r\ncurrently processing requests received in August 2013.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $20,010.40.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to narrow your request for a potentially faster\r\nprocessing time, please contact us to discuss narrowing options.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to FBI file numbers 100-WF-41792 and 100-HQ-440363 on\r\nGavin Hall MacFayden. Our initial assessment is that Gavin Hall MacFayden\r\nis the subject of the records, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation created between April 1963 and October 1970, and consisting\r\nof an estimated 46 pages.\r\n\r\nThe records were previously requested and reviewed for another requester in\r\nMarch 2017, and information was released to the greatest extent possible.\r\nBelow is a summary of our review:\r\n\r\nRecords Requested\r\n\r\nTotal Pages\r\n\r\nPages Released in Full\r\n\r\nPages Released in Part\r\n\r\nPages Withheld in Full\r\n\r\n100-WF-41792\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n100-HQ-440363\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nWe withheld information protected under section (b) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C.\r\n552).

        "communication": "Dear Jermaine Scott,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response. I agree that narrowing this request would be a good next step to decide about how to proceed for all documents. Thank you for the information. I would like to narrow the request to a subset of the documents mentioned for the case files that I have requested.\r\n\r\nI would like to request a fully copy of 100-NY-164641 (13 pages), and then the first ten pages chronologically of files 100-HQ-344527 (10 pages) and 62-HQ-107350 (10 pages). I believe that this will allow me to make a determination of how to proceed at a later date for 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350. Additionally, it should be well below the cap for third tier processing. Would this reduction put my request into a speedy tier or a faster queue? If it is easier to simply narrow to a single locator, I would select 100-NY-164641 and I'm willing to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIf it is also possible to perform a simple release of the already reviewed 100-WF-41792 and 100-HQ-440363 documents, I would like this as well, but only if it does not significantly slow down the response time.  I want to ensure that I receive those full documents from NARA directly.\r\n\r\nI would also like to discuss the possibility of a public interest/journalistic/academic fee waiver or reduction. Gavin was an internationally recognized American journalist working in London, England in the public interest; these documents will help me to inform the public about his life and work. If a fee waiver or fee reduction is not possible, I'm willing to pay immediately for the narrowed files.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to have a telephone call to discuss this narrowing process if that would be useful. Thank you for your time today, I look forward to discussing this request further with you. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJacob",

Once operations resume, your reproduction request\r\nwill be serviced in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nYou asked for a waiver of the fees normally charged for providing\r\nresearchers with copies of archival records. The fee and fee waiver\r\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), however, do not apply\r\nto the archival records. The FOIA fee section states that \u201cNothing in this\r\nsubparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically\r\nproviding for setting the level of fees for particular types of records\u201d [5\r\nUSC 552 (a) (94 ) (vi)]. Accordingly, the NARA fee statute, 44 USC 2116\r\n(c), and implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 1258, apply exclusively to\r\nyour request, under which the National Archives does not waive reproduction\r\ncharges for individual requesters. Our inability to grant you the requested\r\nfee waiver does not constitute a denial for the purpose of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe are legally bound to charge reproduction fees for our records (more\r\ninformation can be found in our regulations: Title 36: Parks, Forests, and\r\nPublic Property, PART 1258\u2014FEES\r\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=ba12875cd02d4f84c4062c1ea87b9208&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt36.3.1258\r\n<https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=ba12875cd02d4f84c4062c1ea87b9208&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt36.3.1258>).\r\nAdditionally, our fee schedule is based on the native format of the\r\nrecords; as these records were originally paper, the reproduction fee is\r\n$.80 per page.\r\n\r\n\r\nJermaine Scott\r\nArchives Specialist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThank you for your latest reply. On 06/09/2022 I was informed that \"The estimated time of completion for your request is 39 months from Mr. Scott's February 9, 2022 email to you.\" By my understanding this is roughly in the middle of 2025. Unfortunately this is an unacceptable time window for the purpose of this FOIA, and a lack of statutory compliance is hampering my research and publication efforts. I understand that COVID-19 is an exceptional circumstance. As I have already narrowed my request extensively because of delays, I request that this now greatly narrowed request is expedited.\r\n\r\nI specifically request expedited processing as this data is for use in a news article that is pending. Part of the article is based on the results of this FOIA. Specifically, I declare that \"if the request is made by an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity; or,\"  The information in my request is urgently needed to inform the public about government surveillance activities of American journalists such as Mr. MacFayden who primarily live abroad.  I'm willing to have my editor write a letter confirming these facts, if that is useful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I also assert that my FOIA relates to another NARA exception: \"when the subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\" Requesting Gavin MacFadyen's FBI file resulted in the case numbers at NARA, and since Mr. MacFadyen was subject to government surveillance, this FOIA concerns a matter of the government's integrity, and naturally the results will affect the public confidence in our government. Delaying the result certainly will affect the public confidence in our government.\r\n\r\nAs per NARA's web page on requesting expedited processing, I assert that the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat's the next step for receiving expedited processing? According to the website, I will receive a reply within ten calendar days - if there is supplemental information that I can provide sooner, please advise and I will attempt to supply this information in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJacob",

        "communication": "Requester Jacob Appelbaum:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\r\nof May 10, 2021 for records in the custody of the National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration. Your request was received in this office on May 11,\r\n2021 and assigned FOIA interim number RD 65692. You requested access to FBI\r\nfile numbers 100-HQ-440363, 100-WF-41792, 100-HQ-344527, 62-HQ-107350, and\r\n100-NY-164641 on Gavin Hall Macfadyen. In January 2022 you narrowed your\r\nrequest to the first ten pages each of 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350, and\r\nthe whole of 100-NY-164641.\r\n\r\nWe completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. To\r\nminimize reproduction costs to you and avoid reviewing only a partial\r\ndocument, we processed whole serials from 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350 up\r\nto a sum of 10 pages; additional serials would take you over the ten-page\r\nthreshold in either instance. We have therefore reviewed serials 1, X1, and\r\nX2 from 100-HQ-344527 for a total of 8 pages, and serials 1-2 from 62-HQ-107350\r\nfor a total of 9 pages. Please contact me directly if you require\r\nadditional pages from either case file.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. Please be\r\nadvised, we have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing\r\nrecords and applying FOIA exemptions for this request. Information was\r\nreleased to the greatest extent possible.

The specific reasons for the denials are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*TYPE OF INFORMATION WITHHELD*\r\n\r\n*FOIA EXEMPTION or STATUTE*\r\n\r\nidentities of confidential sources\r\n\r\n(b)(7)(D)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou or your designated representative may view the file(s) at the National\r\nArchives at College Park, Maryland.

Adri\u00e1n Lamo, or \"The Homeless Hacker\" (Born February 20, 1981 \u2013 Died March 14, 2018). Adrian Lamo was born in Malden, Massachusetts on February 20, 1981 \r\n and has been reported deceased in Wichita, Kansas on March 14, 2018. Major media outlets across America as of March 14, 2018 have reported his death including The Wichita Eagle: http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article205629184.html and follow up article https://www.kansas.com/latest-news/article210989594.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS),  Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that Mr. Adrian Lamo's DNA is on file in the CODIS database, as well as his fingerprints in the IAFIS database, are held by the FBI due to the very public court battle on the matter as published by Wired in 2007: https://www.wired.com/2007/06/hacker-adrian-l/\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Adrian Lamo including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nMr.  Adrian Lamo was a controversial public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJacob Appelbaum\n\n",

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am writing in regards to  Freedom of Information Act Request #1488234-000. In yesterday's reply from the FBI, I was informed that there was a letter from the FBI dated November 15, 2021 informing me of something. Unfortunately, it seems that I did not receive any such letter in November of 2021. The last previous communication received regarding this case was on May 17th, 2021 where I was informed: \"The FBI\u2019s FOIPA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents. You may be contacted via formal letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.\"\r\n\r\nA record of all of our communications regarding this case is available at the following url: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/adrian-lamo-fbi-file-107317/ \r\n\r\nI have not received any documents directly in response to my request and I request being sent these documents directly as a response that may be examined in the context of my original request. The documents posted to the FBI vault do not appear to cover the full scope of my original request which has been pending for two and a half years.\r\n\r\nCould someone involved in this request please resend the letter from November 2021, and additionally send the responsive documents as well?",
