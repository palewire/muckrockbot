The officers involved in this incident were David Scheffer and Michael Jeffers. My request includes but is not limited to documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and other documentation linked to the incident. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence, and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports, and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims, and the overseeing agency.\r\n\r\nAs per law, police misconduct records are public records and do not qualify for any exemption, and are not listed as confidential records.\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee Open Records Act requires a response time within seven days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at shaynacf@stanford.edu or my colleague, Eric Sagara at esagara@stanford.edu or his phone number, (520)275-7506.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Shayna Freedman.",
