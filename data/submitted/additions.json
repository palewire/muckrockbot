I am a journalist and producer for a podcast production company and I am requesting this information in that editorial capacity.\r\n\r\nBlanchard House (https://www.blanchard-house.com/about) is recognized for producing narrative podcast documentary series, reporting and publishing regular series on issues of public interest and importance, such as the below examples:\r\n\r\nBlack And Blue - blanchard-house.com/releases/blackandblue\r\nPirate of Prague - https://www.blanchard-house.com/releases/nwfei4clq9mes1v8n3hacvrt3tkpi0\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have worked as a public service journalist during my career, and plan to use my editorial skills (honed as a producer for the BBC for nearly 20 years) to analyze and produce original reporting work for our podcast audience, who listen to our programmes on platforms including Wondery, Apple podcasts or Audible. \r\n\r\nExamples of some of my previous journalistic work are here:\r\nBBC Radio 4 - Putin\u2019s Religious War - https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00162mp\r\nBBC Radio 4 - The Unabomber - https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07654x0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my media status, please contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\nIf the DVD is not available I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRebecca Maxted",
