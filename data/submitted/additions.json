Under the Louisiana Public Records Act, I am requesting an opportunity to obtain the records of communications between city officials and representatives of Airbnb rental homes from March 1, 2020 to the date of this request. With specific regards to the agreement referred to in the New York Times article titles: \u201cNew Orleans Becomes New Model for Airbnb to Work With Cities.\u201d The said article acknowledges how Airbnb reached a deal with the City of New Orleans to legalize short-term rentals. I am requesting documents that support the terms of the deal presented in the article. \r\n\r\nOne excerpt of the article that we request documents for emphasizes the statement \u201cIn New Orleans specifically, Airbnb agreed to share data \u2014 such as the names and addresses of its hosts \u2014 with the city, something the company has balked at doing elsewhere. Airbnb also agreed that its hosts must operate with a permit, with hosts automatically being registered with the city when they sign up to the service. In a nod to the local hotel industry, Airbnb will also ban almost all listings in the city\u2019s historic French Quarter and set a 90-day annual cap for hosts who rent out entire homes.\u201d\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records onto a compact disc, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50 (including any associated delivery/postage fees). This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 44:32(D) of the Louisiana Public Records Act requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect electronic copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nPlease feel free to call or email me with any questions on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Under the Louisiana Public Records Act Section 44:1 et seqI am asking for specific access to electronic records of correspondence between representatives of short-term rental platform companies and city officials. In my judgment, these documents are available for public access in accordance with Louisiana's Public Records Law, specifically the Louisiana Revised Statute. \r\nThis should cover any correspondence\u2014emails, letters, memos, texts, and other kinds of physical or digital communication\u2014between Airbnb, and their representatives and city authorities who are creating regulations pertaining to short-term rentals.\r\nThis should include: \r\n- Any correspondence pertaining to the creation or implementation of ordinances governing short-term rentals in New Orleans.\r\n- Any draft regulations or local policies that AirBnb and its representatives offer to the city officials\r\n- Any information that Airbnb or their agents submit to the city about short-term rentals in New Orleans.\r\n- Any final or draft agreements that the city enters into with Airbnb or their agents.\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records onto a compact disc, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50 (including any associated delivery/postage fees). This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 44:32(D) of the Louisiana Public Records Act requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect electronic copies of the requested records.\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nPlease feel free to call or email me with any questions on this request.\r\nSincerely, \r\nAnnabel Slogoff",
