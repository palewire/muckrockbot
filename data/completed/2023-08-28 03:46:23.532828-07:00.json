Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request is for the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf or hard-copy. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question (2021), and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format when they were sent electronically, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\nPer RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for copies of records:\r\n1. Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of agency equipment to photocopy public records;\r\n2. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n3. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n4. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n5. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, RCW 42.56.120 authorizes the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing a first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by Friday, March 10, 2023.\r\n\u200b\r\nIf you have any questions I can be reached at 425-408-7605.\r\n\u200b\r\nSincerely,\r\n\u200b\r\nDoug Hale\r\nExecutive Director of Human Resources\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a pleasant day.\r\n\r\nElaine Gisle\r\nExecutive Administrative Assistant\r\nHuman Resources  |  Northshore School District\r\nPhone: 425.408.7621<callto:425.408.7621>",

If the district produced .pdf  to the requestor then please provide the same .pdf format. If the district produced paper, please convert the paper to .pdf. \r\n\r\nMany district public records officers choose to print every page of electronic public records originally produced electronically in .pdf, then applying fees for paper production, only to then again scan the paper to .pdf, and again apply fees, all in a misguided (and illegal) attempt to inflate fees and discourage public records requests. This is a violation of the public records act as it CREATES a record rather than produces the record requested, and the inflated fee estimates are not supported by statue. At some point these specific public records officers (or their employer districts) will come to the realization that the more their PRA officers obfuscate, delay, and improperly deny a PRA request, the more PRA requests these agency's are likely to receive as a counter to achieve transparency for the improper artificial obfuscation and obstruction or the original PRA request (humorous attachment).\r\n\r\n\"For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor.\"\r\n\r\nIf this production format is what the District provided the requestor in response to a PRA request, that was exactly what was requested.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Providing the additional level of detail you have requested, such as listing the file extension for each electronic record, would not be \u201cthe most reasonable cost-efficient method available to the [District] as part of its normal operations,\u201d and is thus not required.\r\n\r\nWe are able to provide you with the following additional detail regarding the applicable charges:\r\n\r\n  *   Regarding the 553 scanned pages at the cost of $55.30, we spoke to our attorney about this and since the files were previously scanned and stored we will not be passing on that cost to you. We are charging you the cost for electronic files pursuant to RCW 42.56.120(2)(b)(iii) charging five cents for each four electronic files.

        "communication": "1-20-23\r\n\r\nvia email to egisle@nsd.org and dhale@nsd.org\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThank you for checking with your attorney and then revising part 1 of your fee calculations. \r\n\r\nPART 1. The 553 PREVIOULSY scanned pages. I originally requested records stored in electronic form. These 553 previously scanned and now electronically stored pages are in fact available in electronic form. The original fee request of $55.30 was not correct, an electronic file fee of $6.91 is correct. \r\n\r\nI agree.\r\n\r\nPART 2.  You state: \u201c6,291 responsive records are available in electronic form as electronic files. Consistent with RCW 42.56.120(2)(b)(iii), we are charging five cents per each four of these electronic files. This results in a charge of $78.64.\u201d\r\n\r\nQUESTION: is the fee request of $74.64 for these files being calculated BEFORE or AFTER .zip or electronic file bundling has taken place?\r\n\r\nMy position is based on RCW 42.56.120(1) \u201cWhen calculating any fees authorized under this section, an agency shall use the most reasonable cost-efficient method available to the agency as part of its normal operations. If any agency translates a record into an alternative electronic format at the request of a requestor, the copy created does not constitute a new public record for purposes of this chapter.\r\n\r\nApplying .zip compression and/or bundling of electronic files is in COMMON use at your agency, and also is the most REASONABLE cost-efficient method available to your agency as part of your agency\u2019s  normal operations.\r\n\r\nTo apply a fee calculation of five cents per each four of these electronic files (6,291 / 4 *.05 = $78.64) however are the 6,291 files already .zip compressed or not in this calculation?\r\n\r\nIf not, I formally request you recalculate fees for PART 2 based on applying .zip compression to 6,291 files and then either choosing to estimate fees based on the .05 cents per four electronic files or the alternative PER MB fees calculation for electronic files. \r\n\r\nThis is the most reasonable and economic method of delivering electronic files and is in regular use by your agency. \r\n\r\nI understand some agency\u2019s choose to inflate fees and costs by printing and rescanning electronic records and ignoring reasonable best practices such as .zip compression and bundling of electronic files in the misguided hope that inflated fees and costs will discourage future public records requests. \r\n\r\nIn this public records request it is my intent to seek judicial review for any fee requests that are not reasonable or supported specifically by statute. \r\n\r\nPlease provide a detailed answer to my questions for PART 2 and recalculate your fee request based on .zip and electronic file bundling.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "This message is being sent on behalf of Doug Hale\r\n\r\nDear 137307-94624481@requests.muckrock.com,\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have carefully reviewed your questions, including with legal counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou asked whether the fee request was being calculated before or after \u201cbundling\u201d the files or compressing them into a .zip archive file. Because you have previously requested the records to be provided in their native format, the District was not planning to bundle or compress the files. Even if the District does so, that would not change the applicable copying charges under RCW 42.56.120.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is because the District is charging you per electronic file, as previously discussed. The District has not and is not charging you the \u201cten cents per gigabyte\u201d allowable under RCW 42.56.120(2)(b)(iv), even though the PRA expressly authorizes us to impose all applicable fees, not just one. See RCW 42.56.120(2)(c) (\u201cThe charges in (b) of this subsection may be combined to the extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response to a particular request.\u201d). As a result, compressing the files so that they are fewer bytes in total would not impact the fee the District is charging here, which is purely based on the number of electronic files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, compressing a large number of files into a single .zip archive or .pst would not change the overall number of electronic files being produced, and thus would not change the per-file copying charges being imposed. This is because .zip folders and .pst files are simply electronic containers for preexisting electronic files\u2014a .zip folder containing 100 compressed files is still 100 electronic files for purposes of RCW 42.56.120(2)(b)(iii), and a .pst containing 100 emails is still 100 electronic files. For example, the official Microsoft<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-222eaf92-a995-45d9-bde2-f331f60e2790> website describes a .pst as a file that \u201ccontains your messages and other Outlook items and is saved on your computer.\u201d Similarly, the website for WinZip<https://www.winzip.com/en/learn/tips/folder-compression/zip-folders/>, a leading .zip file-compression company, describes a compressed zip folder as \u201ca file directory often containing several single files.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou also emphasize the portion of RCW 42.56.120(1) which states, \u201cWhen calculating any fees authorized under this section, an agency shall use the most reasonable cost-efficient method available to the agency as part of its normal operations.\u201d That provision calls for an agency to use a method which is cost-effective to it when determining what fees to charge; it does not require agencies to, as you seem to be suggesting, combine 6,291 electronic files into a single .zip or .pst, and then charge the requestor for only a single electronic file. That interpretation would render RCW 42.56.(2)(b)(iii) a nullity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsistent with the above explanation, the applicable copying cost for these records is $85.55, calculated as five cents per four electronic files with a total of 6,844 (553 plus 6,291) responsive electronic files. The required ten percent deposit is $8.55. Once we receive your deposit we will begin gathering documents associated with this request. We are not seeking to inflate the applicable copying charges, and are instead simply charging the copying costs dictated by the plain language of RCW 42.56.120.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at 425-408-7605 to coordinate a deposit. If I do not hear from you by Tuesday, February 21, 2023, the District will close your request consistent with RCW 42.56.120.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\u200b\r\nDoug Hale\r\nExecutive Director of Human Resources\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\n\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a pleasant day.\r\n\r\nElaine Gisle\r\nExecutive Administrative Assistant\r\nHuman Resources  |  Northshore School District\r\nPhone: 425.408.7621<callto:425.408.7621>",

This request pre dates *ANY* fee schedule or public policy the district had in place on 12-01-2022. \r\n\r\nThere will be no ex post facto application of the districts newly enacted fee schedule to any public records request pre dating the adoption of any public policy regarding fees for public records requests.\r\n\r\nTo put it simply, under Washington State Law your agency cannot just \"make it up as they go along.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the spirit of good faith, I agree to pay reasonable fees for the actual costs of digital media storage devices (flash drive $5.00) as well as any associated reasonable USPS postage costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a single updated invoice for the cost of actual USPS Mailing and thumbdrive or CD delivery only in this request and I will pay it.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nNote: payment will be via check sent from MUCKROCK to your district.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021. \r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\n\r\nFEES \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnorthshore-school-district-19364%252Fnorthshore-school-district-2021-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-the-district-responses-for-the-year-2021-137307%252F%253Femail%253Ddhale%252540nsd.org&url_auth_token=AABqm3KTjnRnsYl087E0T7tox2g%3A1p0zAF%3A1JgDvkOmzT9n-boQXka05ifiywIuRMZngJbod7OgDOY \r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nHLPNBJGR \r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 137307-94624481@requests.muckrock.com \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 137307 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests. Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable. The records requested have been assembled and are available for inspection. Please note the records are provided in two different ways. All are labeled by request number. Most have folders and some are just PDFs. Example: N403 is a folder that holds communications and records for that public record request. There are also single PDFs identified by number, N399 for example, is only a PDF and is a copy of the communications of the public record request, no attachments exist. Some of the initial record request submittals have been redacted pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, and its federal implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.1 et seq., are \u201cother statute[s]\u201d per RCW 42.56.070 that exempt or prohibit disclosure of specific records. FERPA prohibits the District from releasing education records about a student that contain personally identifiable information about that student without parental consent. In addition, RCW 28A.605.030 provides that a school may not release students\u2019 education records except as authorized by FERPA or RCW 28A.600.475. Pursuant to FERPA and RCW 28A.605.030, the names of District students and parents have been redacted from education records such that those records no longer personally identify the students.; This is the only redaction applied. To clarify, the bottom of the communications from the initial request will have a parent name and phone number, and email, that information has been redacted pursuant to FERPA. Please log in to the Northshore School District Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the appropriate responsive documents. Public Records Request - N000544-121322  I believe this production closes your public records request dated 12/2/2022. Please let me know if you have any questions.

A specific subset of records requesrted, the \"List of event attendees and plan-holders\" was not provided as part of the production.\r\n\r\nAppeal should be granted, because Freedom of Information Law is \"generally liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly interpreted so that the public is granted maximum access to the records of government.\" \r\n\r\nIn this instance, the agency's presumed grounds for not providing the attendees and plan-holder records \u2013FOIL exemptions for records containing trade secrets and those whose release may impair competition\u2013 simply do not apply. Lists of event attendees and plan-holders are records of the agency, not the vendor. There is also no impairment to any vendor's competitive position in disclosing the mere fact that they are competing. While proposal documents themselves may be exempt during the process, documents showing a company's mere interest are not. \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is for the remand of the request with instruction to provide the requested attendees and RFP plan-holders lists.\r\n\r\n-T.

Based upon an initial review of your request, and an estimate of what is required to complete it, this agency has determined that it will be unable to respond to your request in full within the next twenty (20) business days.  The reasons we cannot process your request within the next twenty (20) business days include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The volume of the requests we received prior to yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The work needed to process said requests,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that this agency processes requests in the order in which they are received,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The anticipated size of the files from which you have requested records,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that the records you requested may not be contained within a single, readily identifiable, on-site source, and, most significantly,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that this Office\u2019s Records Access Officers (RAOs), are still tackling a Covid-related backlog of FOIL requests that accrued over a two-year period wherein, due to limited on-site staffing, we were unable to access our physical files.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, you can expect a determination on or about May 5, 2023,  which date is \u201creasonable under the circumstances of (your) request(s).\u201d within the meaning of Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a).  See Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454, 465 (2007) ([T]ime needed to comply with a request may be dependent on a number of factors, including the volume of the request and the retrieval methods.  Compliance with FOIL request may require substantial time and may not require agency to provide such records in a time other than that which is reasonable in view of the attendant circumstances).  In the determination any statutorily authorized fees incurred in processing your request will be listed.  These fees must be paid before this agency will release any records.  Pub Off. L. \u00a7 87(1)(b)(iii).\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive a determination by that the date set forth above, please do not hesitate to contact us.

The possible return date of 1/5/23 -- more than four months after the request was filed \u2013 is unreasonable, given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, BKDA is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be filled, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond twenty business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI, on behalf of New York Focus, am requesting either you fill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSam Mellins\r\nSenior Reporter, New York Focus",

While i dont mind paying for my FOIA request this poor excuse for an invoice seems to be excessive.\r\n\r\nThe incident itself took place over a 5 minute period and 4 cars were involved creating approximately 20 minutes of axon footage,  you are attempting to invoice for a very specific 22.38 hours of \"AXON\" video recovery with no accounting, which would imply each 5 minute body camera video would need to be reviewed 67 times consecutively to arrive at the number of hours invoiced  which seems to be an abuse of the states FOIA billing laws and standards.  Please correct your invoice so that I can submit payment, I will separately follow up with the city attorney about this seemingly fraudulent FOIA invoice.\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": " I am writing to address the fee assessment related to my recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, filed on 08/13/2023, regarding a specific event involving the Lansing Michigan Police Department. I appreciate your prompt response to my request, but I would like to discuss the associated fees in hopes of reaching a more reasonable resolution.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that the processing of FOIA requests requires time and resources, the estimated cost of nearly 23 hours to provide the requested 5-minute body camera footage and accompanying paperwork seems disproportionately high. I would like to kindly request a breakdown of how this cost was calculated, as well as some clarification on the factors that contributed to such a substantial fee.\r\n\r\nMy intention in submitting this FOIA request was to gain insight into a specific event from multiple perspectives, as captured by the body camera footage of the five officers involved. I believe that such transparency is important for fostering trust between the community and law enforcement agencies. While I value the dedication and effort put forth by your records department, I am concerned that the proposed fee might deter citizens from seeking access to public records in the future.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I would like to propose a more mutually agreeable solution. I am open to discussing ways to streamline the retrieval process, such as specifying a narrower timeframe for the requested footage or prioritizing the paperwork associated with the event. I am also open to exploring alternative methods of data delivery that might reduce the processing time and associated costs.\r\n\r\nAs a responsible and engaged member of the community, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations in a fair and reasonable manner. However, the current fee assessment poses a significant financial burden that I believe could be addressed through further dialogue and collaboration. I am confident that by working together, we can arrive at an equitable resolution that upholds the principles of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you reconsider the fee assessment and provide me with an itemized breakdown of the costs involved. I am available to discuss this matter further at your earliest convenience. Please feel free to contact me via email.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response. Your assistance in facilitating access to the requested records would greatly contribute to the constructive relationship between law enforcement and the community.",
