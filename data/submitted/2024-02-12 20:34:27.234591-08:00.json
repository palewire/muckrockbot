This request covers, but is not limited to, emails, contracts, work orders, and any other documents and records related to the maintenance, operation, repair, and closure of the center.\r\n\r\nDGS determined during the intake process that the request for \"all records, documents, and any other documents\" was too broad of request.  However, we identified that you are seeking emails, contracts, and work orders related to the maintenance, operation, repair, and closure of the Wilson Aquatic Center between the dates of October 1, 2022, and February 11, 2024.\r\n\r\nAs it relates to the request for emails, the FOIA process requires DGS employee names to generate the mailbox report and search terms to assist with the generated report.\r\n\r\nWe have inquired about the appropriate component of DGS for responsive records identified. If any such record exists, our office will provide it.\r\nTo allow staff to search for emails, please submit the DGS employee's names and search terms. If we do not receive the additional information, this will result in the closure of the email request.\r\n\r\nAs provided by FOIA, a response to your request for records identified will be made available no later than 15 working days from receipt of your request, which in this case will be no later than March 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we may extend the time for a response by an additional 10 working days for unusual circumstances, as defined by DC Code 2-532(d).\r\n\r\n(d) In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in subsection (c) of this section may be extended by written notice to the person making such a request, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the expected date for determination. Such extension shall not exceed 10 days (except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). For purposes of this subsection, and only to the extent necessary for processing the particular request, \"unusual circumstances\" are limited to:\r\n\r\n(1) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or\r\n\r\n(2) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of a public body having substantial subject-matter interest therein.\r\n\r\nYou will be notified if such an extension is applicable in this instance.\r\n\r\nPlease track the process of your request by going online at https://foia-dc.gov/palMain.aspx. via the DC government Public FOIA Portal with the assigned reference number.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nVICTORIA BARTEE\r\nManagement Analyst/FOIA\r\nDepartment of General Services\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\n3924 Minnesota Avenue, NE.\r\nWashington, DC 20019\r\nDesk: (202)671-2313\r\nCell: (202)617-1976\r\nvictoria.bartee@dc.gov<mailto:victoria.bartee@dc.gov>\r\nwww.dgs.dc.gov<http://www.dgs.dc.gov/>\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA5DC9.442B0290]\r\nwww.facebook.com/dcdgs<http://www.facebook.com/dcdgs>\r\nwww.instagram.com/dcdgs<http://www.instagram.com/dcdgs>\r\nwww.twitter.com/dcdgs<http://www.twitter.com/dcdgs>\r\n\r\nDGS has a new home east of the Anacostia River!

The request was for \"Family Offense Orders of Protection in New York\".\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request, and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\nA determination as to whether your request is granted or denied will be reached on or before April 16, 2024, or we will notify you in writing if the responsible program area(s) should require additional time to locate, assemble and review documents that may be responsive to your request.\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.  When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: **\r\nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through Open FOIL.
