        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records responsive to clown sightings and threats made by individuals identifying as clowns between January 01, 2016 and December 31, 2018. \r\n\r\nIn August 2016, reports of clown sightings in Greenville, South Carolina set off a national panic and residents of multiple states claimed to have interactions with individuals dressed in clown costumes and making threats against schools. On multiple occasions law enforcement officials stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was involved with investigations related to these sightings and threats. The following stories appeared around the country in September 2016:\r\n\r\n1) Gallatin County Sheriff Josh Neale stated that he was consulting with the FBI on one such case involving terroristic threats at the Gallatin County Schools in Gallatin County, Kentucky. According to WCPO, an ABC affiliate based out of Cincinnati, Ohio: \"Neale has contacted the FBI and Homeland Security and said the person or people making the 'clown threats' could face local charges of inducing panic and terroristic threatening.\"\r\n\r\nA link can be found here: https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/creepy-clowns-threaten-kentucky-schools\r\n\r\n2) Officers working for the Phoenix Police Department stated that the FBI and its Phoenix Joint Terrorism Task Force assisted in an investigation after threats were made against 24 schools in the Phoenix Union and Glendale school districts. According to ABC 13, an ABC affiliate based out Houston, Texas: \"Police did not specify what the threats said, only that it involved violence and the same clown image. A terrorism task force and the FBI are assisting police with their investigation, officers said.\"\r\n\r\nA link can be found here: https://abc13.com/clown-threats-phoenix-union-glendale-school-district-social-media/1529983/\r\n\r\n3) FBI agents participated in a search of Flomaton High School connected to online threats. According to the Washington Post: \"Callaway Middle School was not the only school involved in the clown brouhaha. In the Alabama city of Flomaton, messages from a Facebook page called 'Flomo Klown' \u2014 pictures of threatening clowns plus text that read, 'I kill people for a living' \u2014 prompted another lockdown Thursday. FBI agents and dozens of local police scoured the school campus. Officials said they found no clown or other suspicious evidence; they later arrested Makayla Smith, 22, and two juvenile Alabama residents for allegedly making the threats. Smith\u2019s bond was set at $200,000 on Monday.\"\r\n\r\nA link can be found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/20/creepy-clowns-police-begin-making-arrests-as-false-reports-and-threats-plague-southern-towns/\r\n\r\nGiven that law enforcement officials in numerous cities claimed that they either consulted with or had knowledge of FBI involvement in investigations related to clown sightings, it is reasonable to conclude that records were created by the FBI in these cases and potentially others. Therefore, I am requesting all records related to clown sightings and threats made by individuals identifying as clowns in the period of January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2018\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Over the course of 2016, the reports of clown sightings caused a national panic, resulting in school closures and lockdowns. Understanding how a federal agency like the FBI assisted in managing that panic can offer insight into best practices for responding to national security emergencies related to mass hysterias and panics in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Please provide names or business titles of individuals, specific search terms, and a date range (beginning and end dates) for the records for which you are asking us to search.\r\n\r\nPlease note that after records are identified, our typical practice is to estimate the amount of time it would take to review and redact (if needed) each record (including each individual e-mail) and generate a cost estimate to respond to your request, then request payment<https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/cost_assessment.pdf> as permitted under the Vermont Public Records act before the records are reviewed if we estimate the time required to respond will exceed 30 minutes.

The\r\nDistrict will begin to compile the information requested and determine\r\nwhether or not any of the information is believed to be confidential by law\r\nor excepted from public disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis process may take up to ten (10) business days. Should the District\r\nneed additional time to comply with your request, you will receive notice\r\nof the reason for the delay and an approximate date the information will be\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid diverting funds from the educational process, it may be necessary\r\nfor the District to recover the cost of providing the information. For\r\nexample, pursuant to Section 552.261 of the Texas Government Code, the\r\nDistrict will charge ten ($.10) cents per page for paper copies, if\r\napplicable. The District will pass along other costs incurred. In the event\r\nthat the charges for the information exceed $100.00 you may be required to\r\npost a cash bond before soft or hard copies are made. The district will\r\nprovide a cost estimate before processing requests anticipated to be\r\ngreater than $40.  Typically, there is no charge for information that is\r\nreadily available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or desire additional information, please feel\r\nfree to contact our office.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWendi Faughn\r\n\r\n\r\n<https://aldineisd.org/>\r\n\r\nWendi Faughn\r\n\r\nParalegal for Public Information Officer\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ashney Shelly*\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Department",

The submission form can be found on this page -- https://www.fatherhood.gov/for-dads/dad-jokes#webform-submission-dad-joke-node-8081-add-form -- and is labeled \"DO YOU HAVE A CRINGE-WORTHY JOKE?\" The form has two input fields that presumably map to fields in the database I am requesting; they are labeled \"Your Dad Joke (Opener)\" and \"Your Dad Joke (Punch line)\". I don't know what additional fields exist in this database, but I am requesting a complete copy, which means that all fields should be included in your response. (\"Current,\" for the purposes of this request, means current at the time this request is fulfilled, not when this request was made.)\r\n\r\nIf helpful in locating these records, it appears that form submissions are sent to this API endpoint: https://www.fatherhood.gov/for-dads/dad-jokes?ajax_form=1&_wrapper_format=drupal_ajax\r\n\r\nIn keeping with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B), which stipulates that an agency \"shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or format,\" and Title II of Public Law 115-435, which further reiterates federal agencies' obligation to provide data in a a\"machine-readable\" format (\"the term 'machine-readable', when used with respect to data, means data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost,\" see P.L. 115-435, Title II (The \"Open Government Act\"), 202(a)(3))), I request that these records be provided in an electronic format that can be imported into standard database software. Examples include an Excel .xlsx file, a text-based delimited file (.csv, .txt., .tsv., etc.), a .json file, a .dbf file or an SQL dump. This would NOT include PDFs or other non-machine-readable formats. The records I request are collected via web form on what appears to be a Drupal website, so there is no question that the records I seek already exist as machine-readable data.\r\n\r\nIn the event that my request is denied in whole or part, please justify any deletions by referencing specific exemptions of the FOIA. I expect you to release all \"reasonably segregable portion(s)\" of otherwise exempt material, as stipulated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Both the code compliance department and the relocation department. \u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nThe quote above is a part of an email correspondence where my former landlord, Anthony De Maio, informaed me that I am to expect a final ruling on my application for the Code Compliance Relocation Payment Program. This was stated before my actual appeal have been submitted.\r\n\r\nMr. De Maio also claimed that he had already been found innocent by the City when responding to a 3rd party mediation service. No released documents by City of Oakland regard this matter or the property located at 918-920 Oak St. Indicate any communications, and appear to show no communication has in fact occurred, as there is no Owner Response or indications that violations have been abated according to city records.\r\n\r\nRecords Requested:\r\n\r\n-\tAll communications, internal or external, that contributed to or were part of the decision-making process related to;\r\n\r\n-\tDocuments related to any deals, determinations, decisions, or contracts made in relation to my case\r\n\r\nTHE INITIAL DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CCRPP \r\n\r\nFOR CHRISTIAN JAY REETZ DATED 12/11/23 BY KELLY HOFFMAN\r\n\r\nPeriod of Records Requested: \r\n\r\n-\t Documents created after June 1, 2023, until current (time of retrieval)\r\n\r\nSpecific Records Requested:\r\nHousing and Community Development Program\r\nProgram Manager Kelly Hoffman\r\nHousing Specialist Corean Todd\r\n\r\n\r\nPertaining to the following following:\r\no\tBuilding and Planning Department, Code Enforcement: \r\nInspector Christopher Scyphers, \r\nInspector Travis Ha, \r\nSupervisor Inspector David Miles.\r\no\tOakland Housing Authority: \r\nRisk Management Director Cha Yang.\r\no\tPrivate Individuals/Housing Providers: \r\nAnthony De Maio, \r\nAntoinette \u2018Peggy\u2019 Ramirez De Maio, \r\nJuan Santiago, \r\nAmanda J. Beren, \r\nA De Maio Properties, \r\nand related email addresses.\r\n\r\nSpecific properties: \r\n920 Oak, 918-920 Oak, \r\n331 Hanover, \r\n570 Grand, \r\n1600 4th, \r\n1507 5th, \r\n185 5th, \r\n555 S. 2nd / 555 S SECOND (and similar combinations).\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAny documents referring to mold (including Stachybotrys, Aspergillus, Penicillium), encompassing inspections, complaints, remediation efforts, and health impacts.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRecords related to relocation processes, especially concerning the Code Compliance Relocation Payment Program and any related correspondence or assistance offers.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDetails about specific units (Apt/Unit #9, #11, #12), roof conditions, interactions with Bay Area Mold Pros, remediation efforts, relocation challenges, Lake View/Encampment issues, habitability assessments, escrow details, appeals, abatement actions, and any reference to Code Compliance Relocation Payment Program.\r\n\r\nI'm requesting records from personal email accounts used by city officials, t in addition to their official email addresses. This request stems from an instance where Corean Todd provided me with a personal Gmail account for Kelly Hoffman when providing me with contact details regarding my appeal process, therefor the scope of my request encompasses a query into the use of alternate email addresses being used for official City Business such as my appeal.\r\n\r\nTHIS INCLUDES EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR ALL ABOVE  NAMED CITY OFFICIALS THAT APPEAR FIRST INITIAL + LAST NAME = GMAIL.COM\r\n\r\n ( Example; KHoffman@gmail.com )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the serious nature of these issues, including the violations of my right to procedural due process, I request expedited processing of this public records request. These matters not only impact me personally but could also have broader implications for public interest and community trust in Oakland's housing and development governance. I will be contacting Public Ethics Commission about this matter for procedural oversight to work as diligently as I can to ensure the  evidence of both parties is weighed impartially and ethically in a manner that adheres to established City protocol \r\n\r\nMost importantly I am compelled to emphasize this matter due to the direct and severe health implications that the buildings infestation can have on the current residents, as we exit yet another storm and more opportunities for water damage arise. My unit is the second unit that has had to uproot due to the habitability issues present at the site.\r\n\r\nI certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. Happy New Years, please stay safe and dry- I look forward to your prompt response and the provision of the requested records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChristian J. Reetz",
