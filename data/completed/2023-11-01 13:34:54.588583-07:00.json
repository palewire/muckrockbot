Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

Frank Paul Cali was also known as \"Francesco Paolo Augusto Cal\u00ec\" and \"Franky Boy.\" He was reported by DOJ as being arrested February 7, 2008. He was tried in United States v. Agate (1:08-cr-00076) District Court, Eastern District of New York.\r\n\r\nCali is widely reported to have died March 13, 2019 in Staten Island, NY (see attached article from the NY Times). Records concerning Cali as a subject should thus be assumed exempt from the FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all US Marshals Service systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies. \r\n\r\nUS Marshals Service systems of records of interest include (but are not limited to) the Internal Affairs System; U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Processing and Population Management-Prisoner Tracking System; Warrant Information Network (WIN); Witness Security Files Information System; and Inappropriate Communications-Threat Information System. \r\n\r\nPlease also search the DOJ-wide system of records, DOJ-005 Nationwide Joint Automated Booking System (JABS).\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that USMS has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative documents. \r\n(g) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person or business where the trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged, or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm to the person or business, and only insofar as the claim directly applies to the records requested. \r\n(h) Proposals and bids for any contract, grant, or agreement, including information which if it were disclosed would frustrate procurement or give an advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contractor agreement with the body, until an award or final selection is made.

Information exempt under this item may include such things as details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel or equipment, to the operation of communication systems or protocols, or to tactical operations. \r\n\r\n___\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Disclosure of the records would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \u00a71, \u00a77(1)(c) \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSylwia Slodyczka \r\nDeputy FOIA Officer \r\nVillage of Oak Brook \r\n1200 Oak Brook Rd.
