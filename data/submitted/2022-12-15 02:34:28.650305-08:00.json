Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This search is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If this information is stored in an exportable database I am willing to accept that database.\r\n\r\nIf no such database is kept, I'm happy to accept a folder of images of submitted labels (if it's easier to include both accepted and rejected images, I will accept both, but if it's easier to provide only the rejected images that is acceptable), along with any spreadsheet or log detailing label decisions.\r\n\r\nIf this information is not stored in a database or log and is instead located in letters sent to applicants, I'm willing to accept the application letter and rejection letter of each request instead of the above.\r\n\r\nIf you have provided largely similar information to another requester, I'm willing to accept the previously processed release(s) in liu of the above information, even if it covers a different time period. If you do so, please also include the initial request submitted by that requester.\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions to modify my request to reduce the burden on agency time and resources, please let me know. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees of up to $50 for processing this request. In the event that there are fees beyond $50, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "This is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records related to Dr. John Frederick Prados (born 9 January 1951, New York City, USA \u2013 died 29 November 2022). Dr. Prados was an independent scholar, author, and fellow at the nonprofit National Security Archive. One focus of\u00a0his\u00a0work was the Central Intelligence Agency, on which he had written\u00a0books and many papers. These included The Ghosts of Langley: Into the CIA\u2019s Heart of Darkness; The Family Jewels: The CIA, Secrecy, and Presidential Power; and What the CIA Tells Congress (Or Doesn\u2019t) about Covert Operations: The Barr/Cheney/Bush Turning Point for CIA Notifications to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your standard search protocol, please also conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the National Security Archive and on the SI-TK-BYEMAN group for additional records related to Dr. Prados.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS:\r\n\r\n1. The subject concerns the operations or activities of the US Government. My request satisfies this factor because it requests records related to the operations or activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the US Government.\r\n\r\n2-3. The disclosure is informative (i.e. \"likely to contribute\") to the public's understanding of the US Government. My request satisfies this factor because the subject of the request, Dr. John Prados, was an independent scholar of declassified CIA documents and an author of many books and papers about the CIA. Thus, any responsive records will allow the public to understand what kinds of records the US Government keeps on people who research its activities, particularly its national intelligence activities. Moreover, Dr. Prados was a public figure. News obituaries about him appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post, among other places. Thus, responsive records about Dr. Prados are likely to be of interest to a broad and significant segment of the public, as opposed to the narrow personal interest of the requester. \r\n\r\n4. The disclosure is likely to contribute to the public's understanding significantly, because Dr. Prados has recently died. Therefore, the Agency will likely to be able to disclose significantly more records to the public than could have been released while Dr. Prados was alive, due to privacy restrictions in the FOIA and Privacy Act statutes. Moreover, I am making this request via MuckRock.com, meaning that anyone in the world will be able to view all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\nNO COMMERCIAL INTEREST\r\n\r\n1. I have no commercial interest in these records. I am seeking them because Dr. Prados was a master at uncovering government secrets. I can think of no greater tribute to him than to request the records that were kept on him by the very agency whose declassified documents occupied so much of his time.\r\n\r\n2. I have no commercial interest in these records. Therefore that (nonexistent) commercial interest does not outweigh the public interest.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Agency should grant a full fee waiver. If you disagree and decide to charge me fees, please inform me of the total charges before fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically,  by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention to this request, and I await your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Your response is required by Tuesday Dec. 13, 2022: \r\n\r\nAll communications between all members of the Board of Supervisors between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12 mentioning any of the following: \r\n\r\nCindy Elias, CE, Cindy, Elias, Police Commission, Commission, PC, President, appointment, reappointment, nomination, Engardio, Joel Engardio.\r\n\r\nThis request is to include ALL  individual supervisors\u2019 communications regarding Rules Committee.\r\n\r\nRolling responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. You must provide exact copies of every responsive record. Do not: print and scan electronic records, provide only the final message in a thread instead of the entire thread, convert native files to PDFs, combine or merge multiple records together, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n* All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27).\r\n* All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n* You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n* You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each request below (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n* You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n\r\n* Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login, sign-in, or agreement to any type of terms of use or acceptable use policies.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\nWe have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for each and every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City\u2019s procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE AND DO NOT DESTROY ANY ORIGINALS OF RESPONSIVE RECORDS UNTIL THE FINAL ADJUDICATION OF ANY APPEALS - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Bureau File 157-2033 and San Diego file 157-3170, for one Mr. Calvin Hendell Fox (July 25, 1928 - March 16, 2001). Information on Mr. Fox is of immense public interest because he was an associate or member of the Secret Army Organization (SAO), a group created and run by a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant, Howard Berry Godfrey. This group recruited members of the San Diego chapter of a right-wing paramilitary group, the Minutemen, and targeted left-wing activists in San Diego for violence. At one point, the SAO was alleged to have been planning an attack on the 1972 Republican National Convention, but personal and court testimonies in the years since that event, by former SAO members and left-wing activist groups in San Diego, indicate Mr. Godfrey may have taken a more active role in organizing these actions than previously known. Information on any associates or members of the SAO would be of great importance in providing added context about the group and the circumstances under which it formed. Mr. Godfrey was an FBI informant between 1967 and 1973.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Fox's privacy, as he passed away in 2001. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Fox's grave at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California, as verification. Further, the SAO has been defunct as an organization since October 1972. Although the Bureau has investigated groups using the SAO moniker, all investigations\u2014such as one occurring in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1973 and 1974 (please see: Bureau file 157-2445)\u2014found that they were unaffiliated. As Mr. Fox is deceased and the SAO defunct there should no be concerns over privacy or active investigations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Bureau has previously released documents identifying Mr. Fox and the SAO by name. This information has appeared in releases coordinated by the John F. Kennedy Assassination Archive in 2017, 2018, and 2021. Any possible privacy concerns would be voided by these releases, given that the Bureau has published Mr. Fox's unredacted name numerous times. As further verification, please see FBI-HQ file 157-23577, of which serials 1 through 105 were released to a requestor and made public in 2018 independent of the JFK Assassination Archive releases. The fact that there have been prior Freedom of Information Act requests on the SAO would also demonstrate a compelling public interest in the subject, warranting the release of further documents on its members.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
