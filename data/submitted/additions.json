Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Colon",
