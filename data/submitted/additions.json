        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 2023, the Washington Post published an article at the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/09/06/cdc-rsv-vaccine-guidelines/\r\n\r\nThis article contains a few key statements that lack individual attribution. Namely, the one I'm interested in:\r\n\"The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with a contaminated surface.\"\r\n\r\nThis does not specifically occur anywhere in public CDC materials. The issue of droplet spread of airborne diseases is at the very center of current controversy in public policy, because it's at the core of an ongoing worldwide scientific paradigm shift in the field of infectious diseases and bioaerosols.\r\n\r\nI am seeking, in the general sense, copies of discussions, emails, and records, mostly external, but also internal deliberations, regarding this article.\r\n\r\nIn the specific sense, in addition to the aforementioned records, I am seeking the discussions with reporters that contain the phrase and/or typographical variations of the phrase \"The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with a contaminated surface\", but also, any documents/records that are used to support that claim, and any related discussions of formulating that claim as presented to the press.\r\n\r\nGiven this primarily involves copies of direct correspondence with members of the public, I do not expect complete redactions under the deliberative process principle.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",
