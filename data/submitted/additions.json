If your agency chooses to transform the .pst file to .pdf fees should be applied via a per MB formula as per RCW and bundled for the maximum possible cost savings.\r\n\r\nIf you must redact information from individual email messages you may do so by unpacking the .pst file, applying redactions, and then repacking the .pst file and then PRODUCE the .pst file as 1 single file for the purpose of applying fees.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of these email and text records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing responsive email records in REVERSE chronological order by date, producing the most recent messages and records first.\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR RESPONSIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\nYour agency\u2019s search for responsive email records should involve a good-faith search of all public employee personal devices reasonably believed to contain requested responsive records regardless the type of device or account from which the communication was generated or where the device or data is stored (including personal devices such as personal cell phones, laptops, tablets, and/or computers etc. used from home to conduct public business during the COVID-19 Pandemic).
