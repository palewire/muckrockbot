The responsive records are required for each DHS component FOIA office by the 2/9/2005 Chief Privacy Officer memo, available here: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/priv_cpo_cabinet_report_submission_guidelines_20050209_1.pdf\r\n\r\nPlease use the same search methodology as the one used in response to our prior FOIA request, designated 2022-HQFO-01117. By way of example, DHS PRIV\u2019s search responsive to that request produced these records: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23685324/dhs-significant-foia-activity-2022-hqfo-01117.pdf.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
