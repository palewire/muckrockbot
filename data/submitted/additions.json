Data and statistics on the extent of staffing shortages in hospitals and other healthcare facilities across the state, including but not limited to the number of vacant positions, the distribution of these vacancies by facility type and location, and the projected timeline for staffing shortages to continue.\r\n\r\n2. Any analyses or reports detailing the impacts of the severe understaffing on critical care provision and the ability to serve vulnerable populations, including estimated patient outcomes, increased wait times, and reduced accessibility to healthcare services.\r\n\r\n3. Records and documents relating to the immediate and critical need for supplemental staffing, including the specific measures taken to ensure that hospitals and healthcare facilities are adequately staffed during the disaster emergency.\r\n\r\n4. Information on the option analyses conducted to review non-emergency alternatives for addressing healthcare staffing issues, including but not limited to the evaluation of potential programs, initiatives, or other policy options that did not result in the declaration of a state of emergency.\r\n\r\n5. Records and documents related to the funding inadequacy for the non-emergency alternatives considered, detailing the reasons why these alternatives were deemed insufficient to address the staffing crisis and the decision-making process leading to the issuance of Executive Order No. 4.20.\r\n\r\n6. Information on other possible executive orders that were considered but not enacted in response to the healthcare staffing shortages, including their contents, reasons for dismissal, and any related cost-benefit analyses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
