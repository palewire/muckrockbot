        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll records, i.e., reports, correspondence, evidence logs, etc., involving, mentioning, or relating to Dorothy Martin, aka Sister Thedra, aka Marian Keech (May 6, 1900 \u2013 June 13, 1992). Ms. Martin was a noted occultist and UFO devotee, and at various points in her life was the leader of a Chicago-based rapturist cult known as the Seekers, founder of the Association of Sananda and Sumat Kumara, and a member of the Brotherhood of the Seven Rays. In 1954, while leading the Seekers, Ms. Martin predicted the end of the world via a flood; her story was covered in newspapers throughout the United States between October and December of that same year. In accordance with that prediction, Ms. Martin's name and writings appear in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files of a number of other UFO personalities and groups, including George Hunt Williamson, George Adamski, and the Detroit Flying Saucer Club. Page 9 of a bureau report on the Detroit Flying Saucer Club, attached, states an FBI informant furnished the bureau with information on Ms. Martin given to them by a relative who attended a meeting with one of Ms. Martin's followers, Dr. Charles A. Laughead. This report also states on page 1, under a section labeled \"COPIES OF THIS REPORT,\" that information on Ms. Martin was forwarded to the Detroit office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI); as such, I am requesting all records produced by AFOSI on Ms. Martin and the Seekers.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Ms. Martin's privacy, as she passed away in 1992. I am attaching a reproduction of Ms. Martin's obituary, published in the Arizona Republic on June 17, 1992.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Although Ms. Martin was a public figure in the UFO community, she had committed no crimes by the nature of her public prophecy in 1954 and subsequent writings in the years after, yet the attached bureau report suggests that she was investigated for so-called subversive activities, a set of actions outlined in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, defined in that act as any \"conspiratorial and coercive tactics\" that \"endeavor to carry out the objectives of the world Communist movement by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by any available means, including force if necessary.\" Page 1 of the attached report indicates it was created as part of an espionage investigation.\r\n\r\nAny records AFOSI may have on Ms. Martin and/or the Seekers would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by showing how the FBI and AFOSI determined which people and groups were thought to be subversive in that period, how they pursued investigations of such figures, and how they did or did not clear those parties of any charges against them, with special concern for religious leaders of non-mainstream faiths and denominations. Ms. Martin, through her association with the Seekers, was a religious leader.\r\n\r\nGiven that this report was created in 1955, almost 70 years have passed since various instruments of the government investigated Ms. Martin and her group. There should be no concern for national security at this point. \r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P043591-091123.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

Mr. Brandon Galbraith:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis email responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), dated September 11, 2023, attached. The FOIA and agency regulations require requesters to reasonably describe the record or records sought.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A); 49 CFR \u00a7 7.24(d). Your request, as described, seeks a significant amount of information and is too broad and complex in nature. Union Pacific is a very large Class 1 Railroad. Under the FOIA and agency regulations, the agency is not required to process requests that require an unreasonably burdensome search.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRA asks that you reformulate or narrow the scope of your request to limit the burden on the agency. For example, focus on particular states, regions, cities, counties or inspector activities. When a request is properly contoured to provide such specificity, it enables the agency to locate records and process your request within a fair amount of time. As you consider your options to reformulate or narrow your request, please note that some records are publicly available.

So that I may better scope my request to reduce complexity and burden imposed on the FRA in satisfying said request, would you be able to provide the technical or other limitation in creating an export listing all inspections the FRA has performed in 2023 for a specific railroad? Also, would my request's burden and complexity be reduced if I instead requested a digital copy of the database(s) or database tables in question containing detailed inspection report data for calendar year 2023?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nBrandon",
