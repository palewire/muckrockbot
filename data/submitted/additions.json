Simple websites (often using web domains associated with American companies such as Uber) are heavily promoted and provide links to Telegram accounts which are offering the drug Mephedrone for sale in the country of Georgia. While this company offers services which appear to facilitate the sale of illicit drugs outside of the United States, a significant number of United States companies (such as Cloudflare) are providing the infrastructure that assists this activity.  \r\n\r\nThe website is located at: https://btcbot.io/ looks to be an automated tool that assists connecting websites to Telegram accounts to drug sales. This is, therefore, a formal request for bureau investigative records related to btcbot.io. \r\n\r\nBureau records related to btcbot.io might include: correspondence with Cloudflare regarding services offered to btcbot.io or affiliated websites, correspondence with SAREK (https://sarek.fi/about/) the registrar with btcbot.io or correspondence to or from the International Operations Division of FBI Headquarters regarding btcbot.io or websites and Telegram accounts found to utilize btcbot.io's services. \r\n\r\nIf https://btcbot.io/ is under Bureau investigation, please do not deny the entire request and release any information available under the law. If you cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's transparency regarding btcbot.io.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
