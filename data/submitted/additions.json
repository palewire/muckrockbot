In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud, hence the creation of the FDNS Data System (FDNS-DS). FDNS-DS NexGen is a case management system, that is planning to use resolved artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) entities from other applications to aid in investigative work, enhance investigative case prioritization, and detect duplicate case work. In the future, there are plans to integrate AI/ML into the predictive modeling for future system enhancements, working side-by-side with the business stakeholders to develop best practices. Fraud occurs in numerous ways; being able to discover and detect persons with multiple identities allows for more comprehensive investigations, reduces investigative cycle time, and improves performance.\"\r\n\r\nYou can find more about this program here: https://www.dhs.gov/data/AI_inventory\r\n\r\nI am interested in responsive records between 1/1/22-12/28/22.
