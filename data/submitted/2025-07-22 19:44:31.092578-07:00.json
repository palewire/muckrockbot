Please include any available documents relating to the two investigations. https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/abortion-medication-seizure-united-states-postal-service-73218/#file-796662 \r\n\r\n3) The number of packages containing abortion medication that have been stopped for their contents, for the 10 most recent years for which this data may be available. If this type of report is not available at this level of substance-specific granularity, I request instead access to reports that detail the numbers of packages containing pharmaceuticals that have been stopped for their contents. \r\n\r\n4) All FOIA processing notes associated with FOIA No. 2019-FPIS-00273\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter, and for your help in ensuring the public has access to information so that they can know whether the USPIS is meeting its statutory duties in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRin Alajaji\r\nLegislative Activist\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Video Requests:\u00a0Our clerks only pull the videos and reports that are associated with a particular case number.\u00a0 They do not view video or read reports, but rather get the request prepared for the Records Custodian to review.\u00a0 This means we are unable to narrow or get certain content in a video that a requestor specifies. \u00a0 You will get all MPD Dash/Body cam recordings on the call. Body Cams-\u00a0Most Madison Police officers do NOT\u00a0have body cameras. Only SWAT, Traffic Motorcycles (warm weather months only), and our North District Officers (90-day pilot program 4/15/24-7/15/24 only) are fitted with body cam.\u00a0 Please be clear in your request as to which type of video you are requesting. Dashcam-\u00a0Most of our officer\u2019s squad cars have dashcam.\u00a0 However, a search for dashcam would include all saved recordings. We CANNOT\u00a0just pull dash cam for the first officer on the scene. We CANNOT\u00a0check the recording to see if the individual was arrested on camera. Fees and Mailing:\u00a0Please also note, we are not yet completely digital.\u00a0 We can electronically send reports, however all video/photos will be released on a USB flash drive and sent out in the mail.\u00a0 With that in mind, please make sure that we have your mailing address on all future requests.\u00a0 Depending on the size of the flash drive there will be an associated fee that must be . paid prior to the release of records The Fee Schedule is here. We will provide you an invoice through the online Public Records Request Center. Having an unpaid balance will delay processing future requests.

I request records both from the Department of Defense connected to the separations, guiding policy and their requirements under Executive Order 14183, as well as records regarding individual service members' self-identification and voluntary separation. \r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI request a complete waiver of all search and duplication fees. If my request for a waiver is denied, I request that I be considered a member of the news media for fee purposes. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nUnder the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, agencies must adopt a presumption of disclosure, withholding information \u201conly if . . . disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 also amended the FOIA as follows (5 USC 552(a)(8)):\r\n\r\n(A) An agency shall\u2014\r\n(i) withhold information under this section only if\u2014\r\n(I) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b); or\r\n(II) disclosure is prohibited by law; and\r\n(ii) (I) consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible; and\r\n(II) take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. . .\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nFurther, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important public interest.\r\n\r\nIf a portion of the responsive records become available before the entire request is complete, I respectfully request that the department provide records on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIleana Garnand",
