Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including but not limited to student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSonny Albarado, a citizen of Arkansas, in coordination with Anne Marie Tamburro.",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Treasury:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Treasury component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA administrative record in matters with successful administrative appeal\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire administrative record in FOIA matters which involved a successful administrative appeal, as defined below. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nI believe that these records are of substantial public interest, because they would reveal:\r\n* how the FOIA administrative appeals process works in practice, e.g. what kinds of arguments are successful on administrative appeal, what actions are taken by the appealed-to entity, what kinds of relief are granted, and why;\r\n* whether such aspects of FOIA administrative appeals are consistent, both within and between agencies, which cannot be determined except by a broad comparison across many instances;\r\n* effects of OGIS mediation on administrative appeals;\r\n* the extent to which agencies comply with the administrative appeals process (or don't), e.g. in responding to requests made by the appealed-to entity, or obeying their decisions; \r\n* policy/pattern/practice violations which cannot be determined except by a broad comparison across many instances, to detect repeated violations (as determined by the appealed-to entity) that an agency has not systemically corrected; and\r\n* courts' responses, and agencies' Vaughn filings, in the context of successful administrative appeals.\r\n\r\nI believe that the records should be very easy to locate, because virtually all of them should be in the possession or control of the agency's FOIA office itself. (Of course, it is the entire agency, not merely its FOIA office, to whom the legal standards of FOIA apply, including \"possession or control\", \"reasonably described\", etc. This is simply a comment about the extremely convenient access to the records requested.)\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\nFOIA provides for administrative appeals. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) (notice), (a)(6)(A)(ii) (procedure), & (a)(6)(E)(ii)(II) (expedition).\r\n\r\nThe procedural terms used in this request should be interpreted broadly, according to the following definitions.\r\n\r\nThe \"appealed-to entity\" is typically the agency's chief FOIA officer. However, some agencies (like DHS) outsource their appeals to another entity (e.g. for DHS, to the Coast Guard Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge).\r\n\r\nAn \"adverse determination\", as used in this request, means whatever a requester appealed about. This includes both a formal response under (a)(6)(A)(i), and any other issue raised on the appeal. This specifically includes \"administrative closure\", failure to respond, etc., regardless of whether the agency deems it a \"determination\" or \"adverse\".\r\n\r\nAn \"administrative appeal\", as used in this request, includes any attempt to use the administrative appeals process. It does not include OGIS mediation (which isn't an appeal), nor llitigation (which isn't administrative). However, it does include requests made to the appealed-to entity or to the agency, styled or otherwise clearly intended to be an appeal, regardless of whether the agency agrees with that characterization, if the appealed-to entity took any action in response.\r\n\r\nAn appeal is \"successful\", as used in this request, if the appealed-to entity:\r\n* agrees with the requester;\r\n* disagrees with the initial adverse determination;\r\n* remands to the agency or reverses the agency;\r\n* orders, requests, or otherwise indicates that the agency should do or not do anything;\r\n* overrides any part of the original adverse determination; or\r\n* anything other than complete agreement with the initial adverse determination, and complete dismissal of the appeal, as the appealed-to entity's only response to the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe \"administrative record\", as used in this request, includes everything that is administrative record for the request, appeal, or OGIS mediation, as well as key parts of any ensuing litigation, such as:\r\n* the request;\r\n* follow-up communication to or from the requester, or OGIS, including determinations, close-out letters, releases, etc.;\r\n* the appeal;\r\n* all communication to or from the appealed-to entity; \r\n* all ensuing communications, determinations, re-appeals, etc.; \r\n* any complaint, Vaughn filing, opinion, or order in ensuing litigation;\r\n* all administrative record resulting from any ensuing litigation, e.g. after court remand;\r\n* all attachments to all of the above; and\r\n* all metadata for all of the above (see provisions below).\r\n\r\n## Priority\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize records in the following order:\r\n1. communication to or from the appealed-to entity (i.e. breadth first, limited to the successful appeal), further prioritized as:\r\n  a. administrative appeal orders and opinions of remand or reversal;\r\n  b. other such appeal communication records;\r\n2. all record in a given matter (i.e. completeness of record in a given matter); and\r\n3. most recent matters (by date of successful administrative appeal decision).\r\n\r\n## Dual track processing\r\n\r\nI request that you process priority 1(a) records \u2014 remands & reversals \u2014 under the \"simple request\" track.\r\n\r\nI agree that the remaining records are \"complex request\" track.\r\n\r\nPlease note e.g. the provisions below regarding rolling updates. \r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Sai: \r\nThank you for your email concerning the status of your Freedom of Information Act request.  Currently, your request is in the review queue. \r\nTreasury Departmental Offices processes FOIA requests in a multi-track system, which identifies a request as simple or complex, and generally processes each request on a first-in, first-out basis.  Your request is considered complex.  During the last fiscal year, complex requests were processed on average within 347 business days.  Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request by June 20, 2024.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \r\nThank you, \r\nReNay Royster FOIA@treasury.gov",

The FBI FOIA vault states \"The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 2023 I received an email stating that the Bureau sent me a response in May 2023 \u2013my assumption was that this was a long awaited production of records. I informed the Bureau I had received no such response and asked for it to be re-sent. \r\n\r\nToday I received an email of two linked PDF's; these are only acknowledgments dated from 2019 without any documents. I believe you can understand that after a four year wait, this is confusing and frustrating. \r\n\r\nI would like to have it clarified whether the Bureau, in May 2023, made a production, or if I just got a 2019 acknowledgment letter for no apparent reason? \r\n\r\nIf the documents are ready, then may I please get the actual documents and not just the acknowledgment letters? \r\n\r\nIf  this is not the case, then this correspondence should serve as notice of appeal of the Bureau's inappropriate and rude closure of the FOIPA case, with a request to remand the request with instructions not to properly search for records and produce them. \r\n\r\n-T.

Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period.

If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.

        "communication": "The FOIA \r\n\t\t\tappeal\r\n\t\t- EPA-2023-006330 has been supplemented with additional supporting files. Additional details for this item are as follows: \r\n \r\n  * Tracking Number: EPA-2023-006330 \r\n  * Requester: Grant Michael Hill \r\n  * Submitted Date:\t08/30/2023 \r\n  * Description: \r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'd like to appeal the determination on my FIOA request No. EPA-2023-005921. Please see the determination letter and responsive document attached. My request, filed via Muckrock, sought \"all records, documents, correspondence, materials, presentations, reports, and data concerning missing/unreported RadNet system data from stationary air monitors located in Boise, ID between November 15, 2018, and November 27, 2018.\"The responsive record provided is shockingly limited. It includes only the unpublished and unapproved data from EPA's RadNet monitoring system in Boise, ID, and excludes other materials I requested that must exist.According to the Department of Justice, an agency should interpret requests liberally and \"must be careful not to read [a] request so strictly that the requester is denied information the agency well knows exists in its files.\" Hemenway v. Hughes, 601 F. Supp. 1002, 1005 (D.D.C. 1985).Indeed, in his determination letter, Mr. Schoaff hints that more information concerning this unreported data truly exists, as he explains that the system did not report data from November 16 through November 21 \"because the monitor was not operating.\" How does Mr. Schoaff know this if not for the existence of additional records and information that was not provided? Nowhere in the responsive document does it state that the system was \"not operating.\" There's just missing data.Either Mr. Schoaff holds personal memories of this specific event from five years ago or (more likely) some record exists that indicated the system was inoperable and I was not provided it. The idea that the only record of the weeks-long inoperability of a crucial node in the agency's air monitoring system is a single page of data strains credulity. Did no one working with RadNet correspond with anyone else about the inoperable monitoring system and the unreported data? If not, how did anyone determine the system was inoperable in the first place? How did officials work together to bring the Boise system back online? The day after the RadNet monitor went offline, on November 17, 2018, there was an explosion at a US Ecology waste site in nearby Grandview, Idaho. The site manages radioactive materials. Was there zero correspondence between EPA officials concerning the unreported RadNet data, the nearest air monitor (which was inoperable), and this event? Did officials keep concerns about the potential for radiological exposure to themselves?It is hard to believe additional records and correspondence about the cause of this unreported data do not exist. Obviously, the cause of the unreported data \"concerns\" the unreported data itself. Thus, any records pertaining to the cause of the system going offline (the ultimate and proximate cause of the unreported data) clearly fall within the scope of my request and must be provided",

The City is subject to the Missouri Sunshine Law (Chapter 610 RSMo) and will be responding to this request under such provisions.\r\nIn addition, I have noted that you directed this request specifically to the Police Department and, therefore, I will only be responding with respect to records retained by the Police Department. If you intended this request to encompass all city records, please let me know immediately as it should be directed to the City Clerk.\r\nThe Police Department retains Sunshine Law requests in the same form as they are submitted to the department and are kept in paper format only. Under the Missouri Sunshine Law, local governments are not required to create new records. Therefore, we will provide you with copies of the sunshine law requests that were submitted to the Police Department during the relevant time period.\r\nDue to the scope of your request, it will take additional time to research the paper copies of the records, redact any information (such as social security numbers) that may be closed by law, and either copy or scan the records. I estimate that it will take approximately _2_ weeks.\r\nIn addition, given the work involved, a deposit of $25.00 will be required to begin the work. The research will not commence until your deposit is received. I will then work until the deposit is exhausted and provide an update on the status of the work. If the deposit exceeds the cost of the actual work, the difference will be refunded to you. If the actual work exceeds the amount of the deposit, you will be required to pay the additional costs of the work.\r\nAgain, I will not begin work until the deposit is received.

Burns Dated 04/01/2021 \u2013 04/30/2023.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Summary of Oral Decisions\" refers to the official opinions issued by the immigration court in the form of concise summaries, intended for the convenience of the parties involved. These summaries aim to capture the essential points of oral decisions made during specific proceedings. It's important to note that these summaries are not meant to replace the original oral decisions but rather to serve as supplementary aids for better comprehension.\r\n\r\nRegarding the specific request for \"oral decision of immigration judge John Burns\" with the IJ code \"JHB,\" I understand that due to an ongoing backlog, locating Summaries of Decisions that have not yet been electronically filed could be challenging at this time. For this reason, I am requesting the production of all eROPs (electronically stored Summaries of Decisions) for the sake of efficiency. This request is made on behalf of the Deportation Accountability Project, a non-profit organization that aims to make deportation data publicly accessible. These records will be made available on our website, www.deportationaccountabilityproject.org.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request that if one aspect of this request will take significantly longer than the other, please release the documents as they become accessible.\r\nWe would appreciate your assistance in randomly selecting 50 eROPs while ensuring the exclusion of any 'Summary of Oral Decisions' associated with Absentia Orders of Removal and 'MOTION TO TERMINATE REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS.\r\nWe hold a specific interest in the respondent's country of origin, namely China, India, and Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv). Understanding how the BIA and the Immigration Courts operate, including whether they comply with the Immigration statute, the federal immigration regulations, and the binding precedents of federal courts is of grave national importance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nABIR APON",

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>",

        "communication": "Dear ABIR APON, \r\n\r\nThis response acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\u00a0 Your request has been assigned control number 2023-76687. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the status of requests submitted through the Public Access Link (PAL) may be tracked at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx, and you will receive an email response to your request upon completion of processing. The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nFOIA Intake",

EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>",

INSTEAD RESPOND TO THE CONTACT LISTED AT THE END OF THIS EMAIL. \r\nThe United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) FOIA office received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, dated August 31, 2022, and assigned it control number DOI-FWS-2022-005919. Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request. Fee Category and Fee \r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Your request falls into the Complex processing track. For additional information please feel free to contact us at fwhq_foia@fws.gov or by phone at 916-414-6682. (mailto:fwhq_foia@fws.gov)",
