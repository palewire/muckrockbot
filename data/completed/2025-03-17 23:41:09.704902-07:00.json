Under California law, record request must reasonably describe identifiable records and remain focused and specific. ( See Cal. Govt. Code\u00a0\u00a7\u00a07922.530(a); Rogers v. Superior Court\u00a0,\u00a019 Cal.App.4th 469, 481.) Additionally, cities are not required to create new records in response to a request. ( Haynie v. Superior Court, 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.) Nevertheless, the City has made a reasonable effort to search for and identify records that may fulfill your request. Regarding your request: \r\n \r\n  *  \r\n The records for Items #1 and #2 are included in the attachments. \r\n  *  \r\n Records related to copyright have been withheld and/or redacted in accordance with Title 17 of the United States Code Section 102 and California Government Code Section 7927.705. This applies specifically to Items #4, #5, and #8. Publicly available copyrighted materials from Axon, including Axon Draft One, can be accessed online through a web search. We do not have any records for Items #6 and #7. \r\n  *  \r\n For Item #3, the attached contract, emails referencing Axon Draft One, and our current report preparation department policy address your request. \r\n  *  \r\n For Item #9, I\u2019ve attached emails referencing the terms \"Draft One.\" However, an additional 30 days will be needed to locate and compile records for Items #9 and #10, as this will require coordination with another department and the preparation of electronic records. These records are anticipated to be available no later than April 16, 2025. If they are ready earlier, I will provide an update and release them via the Records Center in the attachment section of your request. I, Mihui Cho, Police Records Supervisor is responsible for making these determinations, in consultation with the City Attorney. The City of Campbell has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request. Some of the records have been redacted per public records law. Please log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records. City Records Request - C000052-031225  For questions or additional information, please reply to this email. Sincerely, Mihui Cho \r\nPolice Department",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have received your request for:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I am requesting copies of records related to department-specific pay, OT, or non-monetary gifts (challenge coins, medals, trophies) for bonus opportunities. These include opportunities like marksmanship bonuses or other skill-based rewards the department gives to officers.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDocuments, memos, or policies related to bonus opportunities, available bonuses, the amount or item given out, and requirements/standards to achieve those bonuses.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecords from databases, Excel docs, or other recording documents outline officers who received the bonus, what it was for, dates, and reward amount or gift given.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease search 2018 to December 2024.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegarding \"Documents, memos, or policies related to bonus opportunities, available bonuses, the amount or item given out, and requirements/standards to achieve those bonuses\":\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the Department has conducted a search and that records responsive to your request may be found in Volume 3 Supervision of the Department Manual, which can be found at the following link.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Manual - LAPD Online\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegarding \"Records from databases, Excel docs, or other recording documents outline officers who received the bonus, what it was for, dates, and reward amount or gift given\":\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Department has any records for Rex R Ingram, these records remain privileged, confidential, and exempt from disclosure, pursuant to the California Government Code Sections 7927.700 and 7927.705. Section 7927.700 exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Section 7927.705 exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to provisions of the Penal Code. Penal Code Section 832.7(a) states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code. Therefore, we are denying your request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, the City Controller\u00a0may\u00a0have records relevant to your request under the 'Payroll' section of their website available at the following link.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://controller.lacity.gov/\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

The victim stated she rang the doorbell, at which point Fuentes opened the door, immediately used pepper spray on her, and pushed her down the steps. He allegedly took her phone before returning inside. When officers arrived, Fuentes was uncooperative, initially refusing to speak about the incident and attempting to lead officers to the backyard rather than discussing the matter in the designated area. He was later arrested for battery.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nResponded to the initial report and engaged with Nick Fuentes.\r\nRetrieved the victim\u2019s phone.\r\nParticipated in the investigation and subsequent arrest.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Because the cost to fulfill your request will exceed $100.00 and requires programming and/or manipulation of data, TEA must provide an itemized statement of estimated charges that may be included in your final Invoice Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Statement of Cost Estimate for your request is enclosed.  Please note that full payment is not due at this time, only the deposit amount.\r\n\r\nData Specifications\r\nThe attached Statement of Cost Estimate is for work to produce the information responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nLess Costly Alternatives and Format\r\nOn the enclosed cost estimate, please indicate the method by which you wish to receive the information.  TEA must provide you the information in its original format.  However, if TEA has the technology to do so, it will provide you the information in other formats.  \u200eThere are less expensive ways for you to obtain this information.  These charges may be reduced if you narrow or clarify the scope of your request (reduce data fields, timeline, etc.).  Additionally, other alternative options for less costly or no-cost way of accessing the information, such as TEA website or in person inspection, may be described in this letter, if available.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnticipated date on which your records/data will be released to you is indicated on the enclosed statement (based on 35 business days to complete the work) and it is recalculated from the date the agency receives your payment of the deposit, as work will not begin until the minimum 50% deposit is received.\r\n\r\n\u200eDeposit\r\nTEA requires a deposit before beginning to retrieve and prepare the information for you to review or receive.  The deposit is required when costs to make the information available exceeds $100.00, or the information is older than five (5) years old, or the information will fill six (6) archival boxes and more than five hours is estimated to make the information available.  This deposit amount will be 50% of the entire estimated amount and will be reflected in the enclosed cost estimate.\r\n\r\nAdjustment to Estimated Cost\r\nOccasionally, after starting the work, but before making the information available to you, TEA may find that the actual cost will exceed the initial estimate.  In this case, if the cost estimate exceeds more than 20% above the estimated amount, TEA will issue a new cost estimate for approval.  You must respond to the adjusted statement within 30 business days or your request will be considered withdrawn.  If the actual cost is below or it exceeds the estimated amount, but by no more than 20%, the cost will be adjusted in the invoice.\r\n\r\nConfidential or Excepted Information\r\nIf the records or data you are requesting includes student identifying information TEA will withhold this information in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. Section 1232g.  TEA is required to withhold from public disclosure personally identifiable, non-directory information in education records. Additionally, FERPA does not permit state and local educational authorities to disclose to the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) personally identifiable information contained in education records for the purpose of review in the open records ruling process under the Texas Public Information Act.  The United States Department of Education has ruled FERPA determinations must be made by the educational authority in possession of the education records.  Consequently, it is impermissible for TEA to seek an OAG opinion concerning the applicability of FERPA to records responsive to a public information request.  https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/files/divisions/open-government/20060725-USDept-Education.pdf\r\n\r\n\u200eIf the records or data you are requesting includes social security numbers of a living person, TEA will withhold this information by removing it from the record before releasing it to you.  TEA must protect this information under the Texas Public Information Act and is authorized to do so without requesting a decision from the Texas Attorney General. (Open Records Decision No. 634 (1995); Government Code \u00a7552.147)\r\n\r\nImportant 30-day Timeline\r\nSo that your request is not automatically withdrawn, you must respond to TEA about the cost estimate within 30 business days from the date this estimate is sent to you.\r\n\r\nOn the enclosed cost estimate, you must indicate whether:\r\n\r\n1. You accept the charges and submit payment of the required deposit amount;\r\n2. You have attached a modified request and request another estimate;\r\n3. You withdraw your request entirely; or\r\n4. You filed a complaint with the Cost Rules Administrator, Office of Attorney General; and provided a copy of your complaint to the Public Information Coordination Office, TEA Legal Services [\u00a7552.2615 of the Government Code].\r\n\r\nReturn your response within 30 business days to:\r\n\u200e\r\nModified Request, Denied or Accepted Cost Estimate:\r\nPayment Address:\r\nTEA - Public Information Coordinator\r\nTEA \u2013 PIR 73158\r\n1701 North Congress Avenue\r\nP.O.

You mentioned that you keep records in 30,000 or so locations, and yet presumably the type of record I am requesting would not require a search of all of these locations. Furthermore, in my original request, I singled out the communications HQ, public relations offices, and/or related offices as the likely locations of such records. \r\n\r\nI will, however, amend my request to specifically limit the search to the above-mentioned offices, omitting the clause \"in any location.\" If it is helpful, I will also limit my request to production assistance agreements or similar documents.\r\n\r\nI therefore reiterate my request under the foregoing qualifications.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

It is not what we expected, and we were informed it was only for\r\ndetention to hold criminals who had violated the laws and were in the US\r\nillegally.  It would allow us to hold these criminals for ICE to be picked\r\nup.

The officer informed her that failure to stop is an arrestable offense.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nAttempted to pull over Sandra Doorley for the traffic violation.\r\nResponded to her residence and engaged in conversation with her.\r\nCommunicated with Police Chief Dennis Kohlmeier regarding the situation.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

We have a couple of questions or matters we want to clarify up front:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Are we correct that you want the listed variables in your request for both licensed and license-exempt facilities?\r\n  2.  Please note that only Provider Name and Physical Address can be provided for license-exempt facilities and our information only goes back to June 2023.\r\n\r\nA fee will be assessed for this request but your responses to the above will obviously impact how much it will cost. Our online child facility public database may have much of what you are looking for. It can be found here:  Child Care Provider Search<https://www.msdh.provider.webapps.ms.gov/ccsearch.aspx>\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that Miss. Code Ann. 25-61-5(1)(b) allows a state entity to respond to a public records request by up to fourteen (14) business days assuming the entity has informed the requestor it will not be able to respond in seven (7) and gives reasons for it. My guess is this will take longer than seven days given the scope of information you are looking for and the limited staff available to put together our response.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDavy Trewolla\r\n\r\nDAVY TREWOLLA, ESQ, CHP\r\nData Governance Director\r\n\r\nMississippi State Department of Health\r\n570 East Woodrow Wilson Drive\r\nJackson, MS 39216\r\nOffice: 601-576-7855\r\nEmail: David.Trewolla@msdh.ms.gov\r\n[Image]\r\nTo protect and advance the health,\r\nwell-being and safety of everyone\r\nin Mississippi\r\nmsdh.ms.gov<https://msdh.ms.gov/>\r\n[Facebook]<https://facebook.com/HealthyMS> [Instagram] <https://instagram.com/healthy.ms>  [X] <https://x.com/msdh>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message and any attachments may contain information that is confidential and/or proprietary to the Mississippi State Department of Health, and may consist of sensitive information, including, but not limited to, protected health information as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (personal email addresses, etc.) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Please be advised that there are no records responsive to point two of your request.

You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11.

When redacting this personal information, the Planning\r\n   Department relied upon the second clause of the privacy exemption set forth\r\n   in *G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c)*. It is the position of the Planning\r\n   Department that the release of personal email addresses and cell phone\r\n   numbers would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In\r\n   taking this position, the Planning Department believes that such\r\n   information constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" as\r\n   personal email addresses and cell phone numbers are not typically otherwise\r\n   available for public consumption. In weighing the protection of privacy\r\n   interests versus the public interest in disclosure, the Planning Department\r\n   ultimately determines that providing this information would amount to an\r\n   unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the individuals. Further, any\r\n   public interest in the disclosure of personal email addresses and cell\r\n   phone numbers does not outweigh the privacy interest held by the\r\n   individuals.\r\n\r\n   2. The Deliberative Process Exemption: We have withheld (2) emails and\r\n   (2) working drafts of a Purchase and Sale Agreement based on the\r\n   Deliberative Process Exemption. The Deliberative Process Exemption is\r\n   intended to avoid release of materials that could taint the deliberative\r\n   process if prematurely disclosed. Its application is limited to\r\n   recommendations on legal and policy matters found within an ongoing\r\n   deliberative process that are contained within inter-agency or intra-agency\r\n   memoranda or letters. The City's internal planning for the development\r\n   of the BWSC Parking Lots is ongoing and, as such, any and all documents\r\n   concerning the City's ongoing internal planning are protected from\r\n   disclosure under the deliberative process exemption.

Trump.\r\n\r\nThis request seeks to understand how the school district interacts with federal immigration authorities and whether students, staff, or families have been subject to inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions by ICE.\r\n\r\nScope of Request: Specific Records Sought\r\n\r\nI request copies of all relevant records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Communications Between Peekskill City School District and ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all emails, letters, faxes, text messages, internal memos, and reports exchanged between PCSD officials, school administrators, security personnel, or school resource officers (SROs) and ICE from January 1, 2025, to the present regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny requests for student, staff, or family immigration status information.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny ICE investigations, detainer requests, or inquiries involving individuals associated with the Peekskill school district.\r\n\t\u2022\tProtocols followed when ICE agents or law enforcement personnel request access to school property or student records.\r\n\r\n2. School District Policies on ICE and Immigration Enforcement\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all policies, directives, or procedures issued by PCSD concerning:\r\n\t\u2022\tCompliance or non-compliance with ICE detainers or information-sharing requests.\r\n\t\u2022\tHow school officials and staff are instructed to respond to ICE agents requesting access to students or records.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicies regarding notification to parents, legal guardians, or attorneys when a student or family member is targeted by ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tWhether the district follows New York State\u2019s sanctuary policies that limit local cooperation with ICE.\r\n\r\n3. Training Materials and Guidance for Staff\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any training materials, guidance documents, or legal briefings provided to:\r\n\t\u2022\tSchool administrators, teachers, and counselors regarding how to handle ICE interactions.\r\n\t\u2022\tSchool resource officers (SROs) or any security personnel on how to respond to ICE enforcement actions on school grounds.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicies regarding student and family privacy rights under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) in relation to ICE data requests.\r\n\r\n4. Agreements, MOUs, and Data Sharing with ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), agreements, or contracts between Peekskill City School District and ICE, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny formal agreements allowing ICE access to school records, facilities, or personnel.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny federal funding, grants, or financial incentives provided to the district for cooperation with ICE.\r\n\r\n5. Records of ICE Visits or Enforcement Actions in Schools\r\n\t\u2022\tAny incident reports, call logs, visitor logs, or law enforcement records documenting:\r\n\t\u2022\tICE agents visiting Peekskill schools for questioning, detentions, or surveillance.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny students, faculty, or parents detained or questioned on school grounds.\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for Disclosure\r\n\r\nThis request is consistent with New York\u2019s commitment to transparency under FOIL and aligns with the principle of public oversight of government actions affecting vulnerable populations (New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990), the courts have upheld that non-exempt information related to public institutions must be disclosed to ensure government accountability.\r\n\r\nNew York State has taken steps to protect immigrant students from unwarranted federal intervention in schools (Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980)). This request seeks to ensure compliance with these state protections and evaluate whether local policies align with federal and state laws.\r\n\r\nObligation to Preserve and Provide Records\r\n\r\nUnder Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993), government entities must preserve and disclose records that may be subject to public information laws. Accordingly, I request that no responsive records be deleted, altered, or destroyed while this FOIL request is under review.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all applicable fees for processing this request. Disclosure of these records serves a critical public interest in ensuring the protection of immigrant students and families and is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Dep\u2019t, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers should be granted when disclosure benefits the general public by fostering informed discussions about government policies and their impact.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 in processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs will exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nGiven the heightened concerns over immigration enforcement and student rights, I request expedited processing of this FOIL request. Under Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980), timely disclosure of information concerning public safety and legal compliance is essential for public oversight.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nAs per Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect an acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days and a timeline for completion.\r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic copies of records whenever possible. If any records are withheld or redacted, I request a written explanation citing specific legal exemptions in accordance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nShould you require any clarification or additional details, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the 1993 investigation of a fatal shooting incident outside CIA headquarters, titled LANGMUR and Mir Qazi (aka Mir Aimal Kansi, Mir Aimal Kasi) (February 10, 1964 - November 14, 2002), the shooter. Proof of death is not required as his execution was widely reported: (https://web.archive.org/web/20100323145212/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/11/14/cia.killings.execution/). Per FBI standards and regulations, this is acceptable proof of death.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

        "communication": "Good Morning Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Mir Qazi.  By letter dated August 27, 2019, you were informed that the estimated total cost for processing your request was approximately $745.00 for CD releases.  By email dated October 4, 2019, you indicated your willingness to pay $30.00 in FOIA processing fees.  In the meantime the FBI located approximately 33,072 pages potentially responsive to your request and the current estimated total cost for processing your request is approximately $985.00 for CD releases.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex x-large request processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete an x-large track request is at least 70 months.\r\n\r\nRIDS resumed full staffing on June 8, 2020.  Commensurate with the return of full staffing levels, RIDS will being increasing its FOIA processing production.  While RIDS will make its best efforts to meet increased production goals, this increased production rate may be negatively impacted by COVID-19 workplace disruptions.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\n",
