Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nDerrick J. Hensley\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The charges were later dropped, as the law under which she was arrested did not apply to her. Daniels later alleged she was specifically targeted for arrest due to political motivations, and the city of Columbus settled a lawsuit regarding the incident.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who were present during the arrest, transport, booking, and any interactions between officers and the suspect.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Mecham was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, making all related law enforcement records subject to public disclosure.\r\n\r\nI formally demand the preservation of all responsive records, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tBody-worn camera footage\r\n\t\u2022\tDashcam recordings\r\n\t\u2022\t911 call recordings and transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tPolice dispatch logs\r\n\t\u2022\tArrest reports and investigative files\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal police communications related to the case\r\n\r\nDestroying, altering, or withholding these records without legal justification could constitute a violation of public records law and a due process violation under Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2014). Further, Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) reaffirms the public\u2019s right to government transparency.\r\n\r\n1. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) Footage\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll footage from officers who responded to Sidney Mecham\u2019s incident on June 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 133.741 requires law enforcement to retain and disclose BWC footage unless exempt.\r\n\t\u2022\tACLU of Nevada v.

City of Portland, 183 Or App 647 (2002) established mandatory disclosure of non-exempt police records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n3. 911 Call Recordings and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll 911 call recordings and transcripts related to Mecham\u2019s actions and arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) states that 911 calls are public records unless an exemption applies.\r\n\t\u2022\tState v. Worthington, 138 Or App 104 (1995) upheld that 911 call transcripts must be disclosed unless privacy outweighs public interest.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n4. Police Dispatch Audio and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll officer-dispatch communications related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.311 provides for the disclosure of police communication records.\r\n\t\u2022\tNew York Times Co. v. NASA, 852 F.2d 602 (D.C. Cir. 1988) affirmed that public agencies must disclose internal communications unless an exemption applies.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.311\r\n\r\n5. Arrest and Booking Reports\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tComplete arrest and booking reports related to Mecham\u2019s case, including officer narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) mandates disclosure of completed law enforcement reports.\r\n\t\u2022\tAfshar v. Dept. of State, 702 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1983) held that agencies must disclose non-exempt portions of law enforcement records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n6.

Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) held that government information disclosure fosters accountability.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.324(5)\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nI formally demand that all responsive records be preserved under:\r\n\t\u2022\t44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106 (prohibiting unlawful destruction of public records).\r\n\t\u2022\t5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (ensuring preservation of records subject to FOIA requests).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide:\r\n\t\u2022\tA written explanation citing the specific FOIA exemptions invoked.\r\n\t\u2022\tAll segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for processing.

For the Grant Period 07/2024 - 12/2025 the NEA reports a grant of $1,146,200. \r\n\r\nThis N.E.A. money funds I.A.C. programs in various capacities. It can be inferred, for example, that at the city level, some of this funding is provided to the City of Evanston through the Evanston Arts Council (E.A.C.). \r\n\r\nThe specific breakdown of how these funds are divided up is not publicly available. The I.A.C. website instructs individuals to file a F.O.I.A. for cases where this information is desired. \r\n\r\nThat said, I request all communication between the Illinois Arts Council and the City of Evanston (including the E.A.C.) regarding grant money from June 2024 to the time that this request is processed. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be greatly appreciated if you provided a detailed breakdown of N.E.A. funding allocated to the city of Evanston during this same time frame. \r\n\r\nIf applicable, I request that fees be waived as documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSol Thomas",

I am requesting data starting in 2011 through the most recent year with full data availability in the system.\r\n\r\nFrom my research I believe that UTC data is administered by the FLHSMV based on the statutory authority 316.650, F.S.
