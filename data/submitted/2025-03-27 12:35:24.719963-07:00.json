The Lia radiological incident occurred in the country of Georgia in late 2001 and early 2002. The accident was the result of improperly stored and abandoned Soviet-era radioisotope thermoelectric generators. This accident resulted in the injuries to three Georgian villagers. The accident happened just months after 9/11 and the government of Georgia openly asked for international assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (the IAEA) in locating the material. \r\n\r\nThis incident is likely to have generated considerable national security correspondence. Georgia's government was an ally of the United States. The United States is a member of the IAEA, and the Georgian government requesed help from the IAEA. Issues related to errant nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union were a prerogative of the United States as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program created by the Nunn-Lugar act. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, threats related to \"dirty bomb\" attacks were routinely reported on in nightly newscasts and in the newspapers. \r\n\r\nMore information about the Lia incident can be found in this report published by the IAEA:\r\n\r\nhttps://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1660web-81061875.pdf\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for information, analyses, summaries, assessments, transcripts, audio or visual recordings, or similar records related to the Lia, Georgia incident. Limit the search to documents related to the Lia incident created from December 2nd 2001 to December 2nd 2005. An additional interest would be if the Lia incident and the aftermath was discussed in relation to the beginning of the Saakashvili administration some years later. \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency and I look forward to working together until this request is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern.

Any records concerning the revocation of a visa or green card with respect to Rumeysa Ozturk who was arrested on or about March 25, 2025.\r\n\r\n2. Any communications with the White House concerning Rumeysa Ozturk.\r\n\r\n3. Any communications to or from Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, mentioning \"Tufts\" or \"Ozturk\" on or after March 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n4. Any communications with the United States Department of State concerning Rumeysa Ozturk on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's involvement in the revocation of a visa or green card due to protest activity or expression protected by the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html\r\nb. https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/tufts-graduate-student-detained-by-federal-immigration-authorities-42d57a0a\r\nc. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14540283/turkish-student-hijab-filmed-detained-ice-ramadan-tufts-university.html\r\nd. https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/looked-like-a-kidnapping-uni-student-taken-by-masked-agents-in-trump-crackdown-20250327-p5lmy9.html\r\ne. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-agents-detain-tufts-university-graduate-student\r\nf. https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tufts-student-detained-masked-federal-agents-1235304299/\r\ng. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/26/metro/its-really-scary-students-residents-react-sudden-arrest-tufts-student/\r\nh. https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2025/03/26/tufts-rumeysa-ozturk-detained\r\ni. https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/us/video/tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk-ice-digvid\r\nj. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/26/federal-agents-detain-tufts-university-student-turkey/82674919007/\r\nk. https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/international-student-tufts-university-reportedly-taken-into-federal-custody/2VK55QMAOZFIDBR2A6XNKC5XOU/\r\nl. https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/03/26/ag-campbell-says-shes-monitoring-situation-after-tufts-grad-student-arrested-by-ice/\r\nm. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/26/metro/tufts-student-detailed-by-immigration-officials/\r\nn. https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010075008/tufts-student-ice-arrest.html?playlistId=video/latest-video\r\no. https://www.jns.org/common-sense-arrest-of-pro-hamas-protester-rumeysa-ozturk-says-homeland-security/\r\np. https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/03/26/tufts-graduate-student-whos-pro-palestinian-detained-by-federal-authorities-in-somerville/\r\nq. https://www.rawstory.com/watch-stunning-video-shows-turkish-tufts-grad-student-cuffed-by-homeland-security/\r\nr. https://forward.com/fast-forward/707596/tufts-international-grad-student-detained-by-ice-in-latest-action-targeting-pro-palestinian-activist/\r\ns. https://www.mediaite.com/news/disturbing-video-shows-masked-men-hauling-away-pro-palestine-student-her-whereabouts-are-unknown/\r\nt. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rumeysa-ozturk-canary-mission-tuft-university_n_67e44604e4b00db00a39340e\r\nu. https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370602253112\r\nv. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tufts-says-international-student-taken-into-us-custody-visa-revoked-2025-03-26/\r\nw. https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/us-news/tufts-says-international-student-taken-into-us-custody-visa-revoked/\r\nx. https://pressley.house.gov/2025/03/26/rep-pressleys-statement-on-arrest-of-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk/\r\ny. https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/video-shows-arrest-of-tufts-university-graduate-student-235439685766\r\nz. https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-ma-condemns-ice-abduction-of-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk/\r\naa. https://www.seattletimes.com/news/turkish-student-at-tufts-university-detained-video-shows-masked-people-handcuffing-her/\r\nbb. https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-26/turkish-student-at-tufts-university-detained-video-shows-masked-people-handcuffing-her\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum. This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves United States officials' response to events that may involve activity or speech protected by the First Amendment.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by United States officials in response to campus protests.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Any and all agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), authorizations, or written permissions between the City of Clinton and Laurens County (or any of its departments) that authorize Clinton Sanitation to dispose of waste at the Laurens County Transfer Station (formerly the old Laurens landfill).\r\n\r\n2. Weigh tickets, intake logs, daily reports, manifests, billing statements, or invoices documenting any waste received from the City of Clinton or its sanitation department, including waste routed to Twin Chimney landfill.\r\n\r\n3. Internal emails, letters, or communications between Laurens County staff or officials and the City of Clinton (or its sanitation department) regarding trash disposal, dump site access, or waste transport arrangements.\r\n\r\n4. Any records or documentation maintained by Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department that reference the City of Clinton\u2019s use of county-operated waste facilities or routes used to deliver municipal waste.\r\n\r\nThis request follows a prior FOIA submission that was denied based on the claim that no responsive records exist. However, recent public statements from a sanitation worker have confirmed daily waste disposal operations by Clinton at the Laurens County Transfer Station, which is operated by the Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department. This indicates responsive documents do, in fact, exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdwin Chadwick",

        "communication": "Mr. Scott,\r\n\r\nThe San Bernardino County District Attorney\u2019s Office has received your California Public Records Act (CPRA) request.\r\n\r\nThe statistical information that you have requested is not contained in a preexisting document. It would require a District Attorney technician to perform a data harvest of the case management system. You would bear the cost of performing this work. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.575.) We would provide an estimate and will require prepayment. The amount will likely be in the hundreds of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe information that can be provided as part of the data harvest is limited to that which is found in public records that are filed with the court; the District Attorney\u2019s case management system is not itself a public record. It contains information that is exempt under the CPRA; the case management system is a local summary criminal history database (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7927.705; Pen. Code, \u00a7 13300), it contains investigatory file records (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7923.600), it contains attorney work product (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7927.705; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2018.030), and it contains other privileged information (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7927.705; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1040).\r\n\r\nA data harvest could produce the following:\r\n\r\nDate range: 1/1/2019\u20133/11/2025\r\nCharges searched for: Penal Code section 490.4, subdivision (a); Penal Code section 459.5; Penal Code section 484, subdivision (a); Penal Code section 490.2\r\n\r\nFor each case, the following data would be returned:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   DA case number\r\n  *   Court case number\r\n  *   Defendant name\r\n  *   Defendant date of birth\r\n  *   Date of offense\r\n  *   Date of initial case filing\r\n  *   All charges filed\r\n  *   Disposition/outcome of each charge\r\n  *   Sentence\r\n  *   Sentence date\r\n\r\nThis data would be put in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Case numbers and defendant names would be used to keep the data organized.\r\n\r\nIn our system, the special allegation under Penal Code section 490.2 is structured like an offense, so we would search for it that way.\r\n\r\nUsing the defendant\u2019s date of birth and the date of the offense, you will be able to determine the defendant\u2019s age.\r\n\r\nOur system does not track gender. It tracks sex, which is generally not systematically included on publicly filed records, and is therefore is not included in the proposed data harvest.\r\n\r\nRace/national origin/ethnicity is not systematically included on publicly filed records and is therefore not included in the proposed data harvest. While it may be included incidentally, in some cases, it would be unduly burdensome to manually review each case to see if that occurred\u2014such as if a motion was litigated where a defendant\u2019s description was given. Separately, that description could have been incorrect.\r\n\r\nWe are uncertain what you mean by \u201camount of theft if entered in PIMS.\u201d We would not be able to provide you with amount of theft information, as that amount is not tracked in our system.\r\n\r\nPlease review the proposed data harvest. If you are satisfied with it, we will forward it to our data analysts for an estimate of how long it will take and how much it will cost. It will most likely be hundreds of dollars.\r\n\r\nCordially,\r\n\nBrent Schultze\r\nLead Deputy District Attorney\r\nAppellate Services Unit\r\nSan Bernardino County District Attorney's Office\r\n303 W.
