The \"Abasha Experiment\" or \"Abasha agricultural experiment\" or \"\u0410\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\" was an economic reform undertaken by then-First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Eduard Shevardnadze in 1971 in the rural agricultural community of Abasha. The economic experiment generated considerable news coverage at the time, and some academic study since. \r\n\r\nThis is a request for all documents generated by the agency regarding what was either formally or colloquially known as the \"Abasha Experiment\" that began in 1971. Please exclude CIA-RDP86T00591R000100060004-4.pdf which includes a mention of the Abasha experiment, but that has already been released. Please include a search for coverage of the Abasha experiment in open-source collection of Soviet newspapers such as Sovetskaya Kultura and Sovetskaya Rossiya. Please include a search for documents created by the agency that contain the Cyrillic \"\u0410\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442.\" Please ensure that a search of documents created by the Office of Soviet Analysis that include Abasha Experiment is conducted. \r\n\r\nPlease also include a search for any documents or reports labeled as \"intelligence assessments\" related to the Abasha experiment. \r\n\r\nKeywords for search: Abasha, Abasha agricultural experiment, Abasha market reform, Abasha and Shevardnadze,  \u0410\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\r\n\r\nThank you for your agency's commitment to transparency. The Abasha Experiment is a topic of common conversation in the country of Georgia, but finding English language information online regarding this project is difficult. The purpose of this request is to educate the public and provide access to this information to a wide audience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Any opinion issued that mentions or includes the keywords \"partial administration\" or \"partial medication administration\" either as a formal opinion or other formal document specific to Registered Nurses.\r\n2. Any an email sent by the person or person(s) with the authority to opine and clarify nuances and specificity referring specifically to RN scope of practice such as by the DON, ADON, CNO (if an available position at your agency), or a similar high-ranking nursing professional of a different title OR non-nursing professional if such person(s) exist that can issue authoritative opinions on the matter, whichever appropriate person(s) exist within your agency. If specificity is required for this criterion, please refer to the keywords above. I'm aware of the ANA Scope of Practice and it does not opine on partial administrations with any degree of specificity or nuance.  I request emails where such person(s) are either sender, recipient, cc, or bcc, but please exclude baileypillon@gmail dot com as sender and/or recipient in the responsive records unless noted in a response (I apologize in advance) to this email.\r\n3. Regarding (1) and (2), I request to know the specific contexts in which a partial medication administration is permissible, if at all, and if it is specific to the setting, if it is the case. If so, please specify what contexts it is permissible and when nursing judgment and critical thinking reasonably applies when considering the reasonable, prudent legal standard that RNs are held to.\r\n4. The titles of the person(s) that typically work on EMR/EHRs and the percentage of those persons who are medical professionals that hold an active license from 2019-2024, if it is known to our agency. Please breakdown by year, if possible.\r\n5. If there is a differentiation regarding partial administrations (assuming it is within scope at all) between RNs and LPNs and if it varies depending on the setting and/or context within this specific criterion (5).\r\n6. If a partial medication administration is indeed within the scope of practice within RNs, I wish to know in what manner a healthcare facility may limit or entirely restrict partial administrations, if instructed nursing leadership or noted in the facility policies/procedures.\r\n7. The precise policies/procedures taken by your agency in the event that legal action (in the form of a civil or criminal suit specifically by your agency) is taken against a licensed nursing or other medical professional, including the titles of the person(s) involved.\r\n8. Any documents, if it is the case that a rare, one time partial administration is not within the scope of practice for RNs, that state the rationale as to why it is not within scope according to your agency.\r\n9. Any documents or opinions issued by your agency that set forth an opinion, guidelines, or other type of document wherein there is a clinical disagreement between the RN and MD/DO/ARNP/PA regarding an order, according to clinical judgment, if it conflicts between the RN and provider.\r\n10. Any documents wherein a non-nursing medical professional (specifically an MD/DO) can decide (and if it is legal) what is or isn't within the scope of practice for an RN, given that the provider is not an RN.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records for the above criteria exceed 200 records, please provide the number of responsive records by each criterion so that I can narrow the scope and/or time frame of this request. I sincerely appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and such documents made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I grant permission for fees up to $50.

If there is a differentiation regarding partial administrations (assuming it is within scope at all) between RNs and LPNs and if it varies depending on the setting and/or context within this specific criterion (5).\r\n6. If a partial medication administration is indeed within the scope of practice within RNs, I wish to know in what manner a healthcare facility may limit or entirely restrict partial administrations, if instructed nursing leadership or noted in the facility policies/procedures.\r\n7. The precise policies/procedures taken by your agency in the event that legal action (in the form of a civil or criminal suit specifically by your agency) is taken against a licensed nursing or other medical professional, including the titles of the person(s) involved.\r\n8. Any documents, if it is the case that a rare, one time partial administration is not within the scope of practice for RNs, that state the rationale as to why it is not within scope according to your agency.\r\n9. Any documents or opinions issued by your agency that set forth an opinion, guidelines, or other type of document wherein there is a clinical disagreement between the RN and MD/DO/ARNP/PA regarding an order, according to clinical judgment, if it conflicts between the RN and provider.\r\n10. Any documents wherein a non-nursing medical professional (specifically an MD/DO) can decide (and if it is legal) what is or isn't within the scope of practice for an RN, given that the provider is not an RN.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records for the above criteria exceed 200 records, please provide the number of responsive records by each criterion so that I can narrow the scope and/or time frame of this request. I sincerely appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and such documents made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I grant permission for fees up to $50. If the fees are still in excess of $50, please let me know as well as the number of results produced and I will further revise the criteria. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days. Please provide an estimated completion date for the above responsive records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon RN",

        "communication": "Good day,\r\n\r\nWe are in receipt of your open records request.  DPS will seek reimbursement for reasonable fees pursuant to our charging chart and consistent with Georgia law.  For fee information, please see O.C.G.A. \u00a750-18-71.  You may review our charging chart at https://dps.georgia.gov/charging-fees-open-records-requests.  If the costs exceed $25.00, we will wait for your agreement to pay the estimated costs before completing the request.  Please see O.C.G.A. \u00a750-18-71(d).\r\n\r\nGenerally, our requestors seek dashcam videos for known events, including citations, crashes, incidents, and arrests.  At a minimum, the requestor provides the name of the subject person, which allows us to pull associated reports to locate any dashcam video.  Even then, dashcam video is not releasable if there are citations issued, if an arrest has been made or if there is a pending investigation which is usually the case for pursuits.  Please see O.C.G.A. 50-18-72(a)(4).  When an investigation is pending, the requestor is tasked with providing either a criminal disposition sheet, a Judge\u2019s Order, or the respective prosecutor\u2019s written authorization before we may release the dashcam video.\r\n\r\nIf you request all GSP pursuits without a timeframe, we will have to go through hours of video footage without knowing the names of subjects involved and without being able to match those names to citations, crash, incident, or arrest reports.  Then we will have to determine which videos were releasable.  It will be an extremely costly and time-consuming task.\r\n\r\nPlease consider narrowing your request.  If you have a specific video that you want to request, please advise so we may assist.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nPatience Patterson\r\nProject Data Analyst\r\nGeorgia Department of Public Safety\r\nLegal Services Department\r\n959 E.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA) has communicated, albeit without specific legal citations, that \"In 1945, the expenditure of public funds payable as dues to the Association was given a legal foundation in Education Law by the state Legislature.\" In light of this statement, I am seeking access to records under the New York State Freedom of Information Law that could provide clarification and documentation of this legal foundation. My request includes:\r\n\r\n-Legislative Documents: I am requesting copies of legislative documents, memoranda, or official notices from around 1945 that detail the authorization for school districts to use public funds for NYSSBA membership dues. This includes any legislative acts or amendments specifically enabling such expenditures.\r\n\r\n-Official Correspondence: I seek any official correspondence between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and NYSSBA, dating from 1945 to the current day, which discusses or references the legal basis for using public funds for NYSSBA dues.\r\n\r\n-Policy Documents: I am interested in obtaining any policy documents, guidelines, or bulletins issued by NYSED that address or relate to the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\nI recognize the importance of making my request specific and actionable. This request is aimed at accessing existing, identifiable records without requiring your department to undertake legal interpretation or generate new documentation.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the timeframe specified in my request, spanning from 1945 to the present, may present a broad scope that could potentially place an undue burden on your department. Therefore, I would like to emphasize my openness to partial responses. If locating documents from the entire period specified proves to be overly burdensome, I kindly request that the department prioritize the search and provision of documents from the following more focused timeframes, in order of importance:\r\n\r\n-Documents from the year 1945/1946 itself, given its specific mention in the context of providing legal foundation for school districts' expenditures on NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\n-Key documents from significant legislative or policy milestones related to this matter, should they be readily identifiable by your department.\r\n\r\nThis approach is intended to balance the need for thoroughness with practical considerations regarding the volume of records and the effort required to retrieve them. My goal is to facilitate a manageable and effective search process that aligns with both our interests in accessing relevant public records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if during the process of fulfilling this request, specific documents are identified that would substantially respond to the core of my inquiry, I am amenable to narrowing the scope further based on your suggestions. Your expertise and understanding of the department's records could provide valuable guidance in focusing this request more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
