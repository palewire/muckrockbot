Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department.

Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3).

Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 5.8.Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 5.8.Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 5.8.Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741- 5769.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 5.8.Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741- 5769.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E).

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department.

Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.

I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.

Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

        "communication": "Dear Social Security Administration:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nPlease see previously:\r\nDOC-NTIS-2019-000203\r\nDOC-NTIS-2021-000490\r\nDOC-OS-2021-000490\r\nDOJ-AP-2019-005746\r\nGSA-2021-000087\r\nGSA-2021-000088\r\nNARA-NGC-2021-000054 \r\nNARA-NGC-2021-000055\r\nSSA-2019-000571\r\nSSA-2019-000831\r\nSSA-2019-002016\r\nSSA-2020-000511\r\nSSA-2020-005956\r\nSSA-2020-006392\r\nSSA-2021-000478\r\nSSA-2021-000479\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is different from the prior ones because for this request, the 15 CFR 1110.2 SSDMF cut-off date is 3y before your search on this request, which is later than the prior cut-offs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Open Access DMF\r\n\r\nI request the entire Open Access\u2020 Death Master File, as defined in 15 CFR 1110.2:\r\n\r\n\"Open Access DMF. The DMF product made available by NTIS which does not include DMF with respect to any deceased individual at any time during the three-calendar-year period beginning on the date of the individual's death.\"\r\n\r\nI request everything in original native electronic format as currently stored. Contrasted with your prior release, I specifically require that the transfer be made in electronic format. No CDs or DVDs or USB drives or floppy disks. Either give me your site to download it from, or upload it to Muckrock, or upload it to my SFTP, RSYNC shell, Dropbox, or Google Drive, which I will provide on request and can handle multiple terabytes of data at no cost to you.\r\n\r\nIn order to potentially reduce costs, I request that you tell me the actual change in any cost you would otherwise impose if I were to narrowly exclude the specific rows of data that were released in SSA-2019-000831 / SSA-2019-000571 / SSA-2020-000511 / SSA-2020-006392, but only to the extent that rows in the current OADMF are exactly identical to prior rows \u2014 i.e. so that all rows with any change whatever from the last release to me, all rows not in the last release to me, and all documents changed since or not in the last release to me, would still be included. I do not at this time consent to such a limitation; this is simply an inquiry to enable negotiation to reduce costs. \r\n\r\nTo be clear, I specifically deny that you have any right whatever to charge costs, and expressly reserve the right to sue you for any charge you may impose, regardless of whether I pay your demand. Any such payment would be as a surety only in order to facilitate a more expeditious disclosure, made expressly under protest and with the explicit intent and reservation to sue you for imposing the unlawful charge. (This also was and remains true for the last disclosure, for which you demanded payment, which I paid.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2020 I specifically do NOT request the Limited Access DMF, and refuse to participate in 15 CFR 1110 \"certification\".\r\n\r\nThe requirements of 15 CFR Part 1110 only apply to \"any Person seeking access to a Limited Access DMF\"; see 15 CFR 1110.1(b), limiting its applicability. This is reiterated in 15 CFR 1110.100(b),  which says that \"Certification under this part is not required for any Person to access the Open Access DMF made available by NTIS\".\r\n\r\n42 USC 106c(e)(1)'s FOIA exemption only applies to \"the information described in subsection (a)\", i.e. the Limited Access DMF information, which I do not seek.\r\n\r\n\r\n### \r\nAll content after this line is part of my standard template.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n# Prioritization\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize, in order:\r\n1. the items & subitems above, in the order listed\r\n2. within each item or subitem, most recent records first.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional requests\r\n\r\nI also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind, use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack), and need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR 1194.22, USAB ATBCB-2015-0002, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\nPlease note that \u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR 1194.22, and UESB NPRM ATBCB-2015-0002.\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\n\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

Code Ann. \u00a7 25-19-101 et seq., I request that the Arkansas Post-Prison Transfer Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) make the below documents available for copying or inspection. \r\n\r\n1) Please provide any and all internal policies, procedures, assessments, standards, or guidelines used by the Board to determine whether to issue an arrest warrant for an individual alleged to have violated the conditions of their release per Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-93-705(a)(1)(A)(i). \r\n\r\n2) Please provide any and all internal policies, procedures, assessments, standards, or guidelines used by the Board regarding the appointment of attorneys for indigent individuals at parole revocation hearings per Code Ark. R. 158.00.1-3.9. \r\n\r\n3) Please provide any and all internal policies, procedures, assessments, standards, or guidelines used by the Board to determine which facilities are deemed suitable for the temporary detainment of individuals arrested for parole violations prior to their revocation hearing date per Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-93-705(a)(3). \r\n\r\n4) Please provide any and all internal policies, procedures, assessments, standards, or guidelines used by the Board to determine when a parole revocation hearing may be held without first holding a preliminary hearing pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-93-705(e). \r\n\r\n5) Please provide any and all internal policies, procedures, assessments, standards, or guidelines used by the Board to determine when to schedule an individual\u2019s parole revocation hearing subsequent to that individual\u2019s arrest per Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-93-705(c)(1)(A). \r\n\r\n6) Please provide any and all internal policies, procedures, assessments, standards, or guidelines used by the Board to determine whether to take any of the following actions against an individual found to have violated a condition of their release per Code Ark. R. 158.00.1-3.6: \r\n\r\n          a) Returning the individual to supervision; \r\n\r\n          b) Imposing additional conditions of release; \r\n\r\n          c) Ordering placement in an Arkansas Division of Correction (ADC) facility; \r\n\r\n          d) Ordering placement in an Arkansas Department of Community Correction (ACC) Regional Correctional Facility (RCF); \r\n\r\n          e) Ordering placement in the Technical Violator\u2019s Program (TVP); or \r\n\r\n          f) Utilizing an appropriate alternative to incarceration. \r\n \r\nI ask that the Board provide the above records within three business days of receipt of this request, as required by Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(e). I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. I also ask that the Board provide me with a fee estimate prior to fulfilling any request. \r\n\r\nShould any part of the above request be denied, I request the Board provide a written response citing the specific statutory exemption, as required by Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(a)(3). If some of the above records are disclosable and others exempt, please provide the disclosable documents and provide the exemption(s) preventing disclosure of the rest per Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(f). If any of the above documents are administratively controlled by a different custodian than the Board, I ask that the Board please provide those custodians\u2019 information, per Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(a)(3)(C).   \r\n\r\nPlease note that I am a citizen of Arkansas, and I am using MuckRock\u2019s services to help manage and track my request. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nSonny Albarado, a citizen of Arkansas, in coordination with Matthew.",

An email from the Redmond Police Department regarding a shooting at the weekend raffle would be responsive as a crime related incident.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in reverse chronological format. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records last.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for maBenton a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst or .pdf PORTFOLIO electronic format with the most records possible included per file and per each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
