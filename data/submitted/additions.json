Please include transcripts of the calls and bodycam footage if available. One particular call is of great public interest: the call from Sean Kelly, the only independent eyewitness in this case. The public has not heard that call, nor have we seen the transcript of it. Other calls from witnesses who were not eyewitnesses have been released publicly. I would also like the original police reports associated with the case as well.\r\n\r\nThe  incident took place around 4:30am on 07/12/2020 in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood.  Cross streets Nichols Canyon Rd and Courtney Avenue.\r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions. If the requested footage is withheld in its entirety, please provide a detailed explanation citing relevant public records exemption(s).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDana T.",

I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nIf your department does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian\u2019s name and address.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
