The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

With the FOIAXpress application, the PAL is the best method for EPA to release voluminous records to our Requesters, without encountering MB-limiting firewalls and such transmission impediments.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is working diligently to solve this FOIAXpress issue.  In the interim, we have taken the step to \"push\" a system-generated invitation to create a PAL account to you.  You should receive an email from address noreply_nfo@epa.gov<mailto:noreply_nfo@epa.gov> with instructions on how to take the next steps to successfully establish the PAL account.\r\n\r\nIf you chose to establish this account, this would then ensure that all future interim and final responses from your FOIA requests to EPA will be available for download via the PAL.  It will also allow you to submit any new requests to U.S. EPA using your PAL account.\r\nRegards,\r\nRebecca Clausen, on behalf of the\r\nEPA FOIAXpress Implementation Team",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Elizondo-Pinochi: \r\n\r\nI  previously submitted a public records request to the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) regarding current mental health staff. I was informed that NDOC does not maintain these records and that the Department of Administration (specifically Human Resources) is the custodian, to which I submitted a public records request.\r\n\r\nHowever, the DOA has now replied stating they are not the custodian and referred me back to NDOC. To simplify the request and avoid unnecessary burden, I\u2019d like to narrow the scope to a single question:\r\n\r\nCould you kindly provide the name(s) and contact information (email or phone) for the individual or individuals responsible for overseeing mental health or behavioral health programming within Nevada Department of Corrections facilities \u2014 such as a Chief Psychologist, Mental Health Director, or similar supervisory role?\r\n\t\u2022\tFull name\r\n\t\u2022\tJob title\r\n\t\u2022\tAssigned facility\r\n\t\u2022\tWork email and/or phone number (if available)\r\n\t\u2022\tDepartment (e.g. Behavioral Health)\r\n\r\nI understand many services are contracted out \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, any direction you could offer (e.g. relevant points of contact at the contracting entity) would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFor context: I\u2019m reaching out as part of a nonprofit initiative exploring the possibility of offering free meditation-based rehabilitation programming to incarcerated populations across the U.S., including Nevada. Similar programs have been successfully implemented in state and federal prisons in the U.S. and abroad, with evidence showing significant benefits to inmate well-being and facility safety.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",

Is there anything to indicate the actual salary and their FTE?\r\n\r\nAnswer: That is the actual salary as FTE.\r\nFollow-up: When I ask about \"FTE\" I mean if these positions are full time or part time. Also, by actual salary, I mean the actual amount the employee earns, and not potential like the ranges indicate. Full-time which equates to a minimum of 35 hours per week.\r\n\nThank You,\r\n\r\nKristin Leszkowicz\r\nAssistant to the President\r\nSUNY Niagara\r\n716-614-5902\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DBD941.E5B2BF00]",

The only releasable case was uploaded to the portal, along with a copy of the AG's ruling on 24-1791. I am still waiting on HR to get back with whether or not there is any reprimands in his file and will write again once they get back with me.***** For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any communications, on or after April 1, 2025, concerning the planned appearance by Ryan Holiday on April 14, 2025, as reported in this New York Times piece: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/naval-academy-speech-censorship.html.\r\n\r\n2. Any communications, on or after April 1, 2025, concerning the cancellation, postponement, or rescheduling of Ryan Holiday's April 14, 2025 appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the removal of books from a library due to their viewpoints or content and the cancellation of a speech on the basis that discussion of those books (or their removal) might violate an order of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted media coverage, including the Associated Press report identified above. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the cancellation of a speech based on its contents or viewpoint.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations. That information is not in the public domain and relates to a decision that has received attention from a prominent newspaper.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request all records related to Gen. John Kirk Singlaub. Singlaub was born July 10, 1921 in what is now Independence, California, USA. He died January 29, 2022.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT:\r\n\r\nIn May 1977, Singlaub (then the Army's third-ranking official on the Korean Peninsula) spoke out publicly against President Carter's decision to withdraw 32,000 ground troops from the Korean Peninsula.\r\n\r\nGen. Singlaub started the U.S. Council for World Freedom, an affiliate of the World Anti-Communist League. In addition, Gen. Singlaub was involved with the Western Goals Foundation, a private domestic intelligence group bankrolled by conservative Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt to gather information on leftist groups and their leaders. Gen. Singlaub\u2019s chief function in what the Los Angeles Times called the business of \u201cprivate-enterprise insurgency\u201d was raising millions of dollars to supply arms to anti-communist paramilitaries in places such as Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and Laos. He was also the chairman of the OSS Society, a group that seeks to preserve the legacy of the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. In the early 1980s, as Congress began curtailing U.S. funding of efforts to overthrow leftist regimes in Nicaragua and elsewhere, Gen. Singlaub and his organizations remained an important conduit of materiel and financial assistance to right-wing paramilitaries, reportedly with the help of deep-pocketed conservatives and foreign governments.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: \r\n\r\nIn addition to standard practices, please search the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nPlease include a cross-reference search of the following things to see if they contain additional records related to Gen. Singlaub: U.S. COUNCIL FOR WORLD FREEDOM, WORLD ANTI-COMMUNIST LEAGUE, WESTERN GOALS FOUNDATION, OSS SOCIETY\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Gen. Singlaub has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Gen. Singlaub was a public figure. News obituaries for Gen. Singlaub appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Gen. Singlaub has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Gen. Singlaub's status as a U.S. Army General, a public figure, and a private funder of right-wing paramilitaries, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor, \r\n  \r\n The St. Charles City Police Department Records Division received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo on Wednesday, June 4, 2025.  \r\n  \r\n Your request reference number is Request Number: PD2025-382  \r\n Your security key is 94DB11EF  \r\n  \r\n Please have both reference numbers available when communicating with our staff regarding your request.  \r\n  \r\n Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. This department is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three-business-day period. \u00a7 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n \r\nEstimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within seven business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. We will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within seven business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than seven business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. \r\n \r\nBilling: \r\nThis department will charge fees for copies and research time required for fulfilling records requests at the actual cost of research time. \u00a7 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items.\" Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. \r\n \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. This department will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. \u00a7 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\n \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. \r\n  \r\n Thank you,  \r\n  \r\n Saint Charles Police Department \r\n1781 Zumbehl Road\r\nSaint Charles, MO 63303 \r\n(636) 940-4619",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

Please note that the Department would have normally redacted your personal email address from these records. However, since you are the individual who submitted this personally identifiable information when you submitted the information to the Department's Unemployment Insurance Division, these records are being provided without redaction.\r\n\r\nFor the remaining items of your request:\r\n\r\nInformation Identifying Individual Unemployment Insurance Claimants: The Department considers information regarding whether an individual is receiving, has received, or has applied for unemployment insurance to be confidential. See 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 603.4, 603.5; Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.14(7)(a); and Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DWD 149.02. Therefore, the Department has withheld documents that identify individuals who are receiving, have received, or have applied for unemployment insurance.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(4)(b), to the extent this is a denial, this determination is subject to review by mandamus under Wis.
