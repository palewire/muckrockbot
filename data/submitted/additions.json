All Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) or Significant Event Notifications (SENs) from GEO to ICE\u2019s ERO\u2019s Seattle Field Office regarding events at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington, or from GEO to the ICE Contracting Officer for the period beginning February 1, 2023, and ending February 16, 2023.\r\n\r\n2. Records of notification by GEO to ICE\u2019s ERO\u2019s Seattle Field Office of any disciplinary proceedings initiated at the NWIPC between Feb. 1 and Feb. 16, 2023. \r\n\r\n3. Any communications to ICE ERO\u2019s Seattle Field Office referencing policy changes or changes in conditions at the NWIPC agreed to by GEO between February 1 and February 16, 2023. \r\n\r\n4. Any records of communication between ICE officials and GEO officials between February 1 and February 16, 2023, containing the phrases \u201chunger strike\u201d, \u201cuse of force\u201d, \u201cUOF\u201d, \u201cOC Spray\u201d, or \u201cpepper spray.\u201d \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n\r\n1. In February 2023, scores of people locked inside the NWIPC initiated a hunger strike calling attention to a host of abusive conditions inside the facility, and aimed at demanding immediate change from its operator, The GEO Group, Inc.\r\n2. The struggle of people locked inside NWIPC against inhumane and dangerous conditions and abuses has been the subject of widespread and exceptional media attention about which there exist serious questions of public integrity affecting the public\u2019s confidence in the continued operation of the facility. A representative, non-exhaustive sampling of this media attention is below:  \r\n- Rafael Bernal, \u201cICE unable to stamp out abuse allegations at detention centers,\u201d The Hill (Feb. 16, 2023) https://thehill.com/latino/3860354-ice-unable-to-stamp-out-abuse-allegations-at-detention-centers/\r\n-  Alexandra Martinez, \u201cOver 85 people incarcerated at Northwest Detention Center go on hunger strike against inhumane treatment,\u201d Prism (February 15, 2023) available at https://prismreports.org/2023/02/15/northwest-detention-center-hunger-strike-ice/\r\n- Guy Oron, \u201cThese are not detention centers, these are prisons\u2019: Hunger strike highlights poor conditions at NWDC,\u201d Real Change News (Feb. 15, 2023) available at https://www.realchangenews.org/news/2023/02/15/these-are-not-detention-centers-these-are-prisons-hunger-strike-highlights-poor\r\n- Luz Melissa Cortez Nieto, \u201cAt Least 85 Detainees Protest Conditions while Immigrant Detention Officials Pepper Spray and Lockdown Units,\u201d Tribuno del Pueblo  https://tribunodelpueblo.org/hunger-strike-begins-at-northwest-detention-center/\r\n-  Camryn Mata, \u201cHunger Strike Protests at Tacoma ICE Facility,\u201d The Spectator (February 15, 2023) available at https://seattlespectator.com/2023/02/15/hunger-strike-protests-occur-in-tacoma-ice-facility/\r\n- KUOW Staff, \u201cHunger strike suspended at Tacoma ICE facility, but objections remain,\u201d NPR-KUOW (Feb. 6, 2023) available at https://www.kuow.org/stories/hunger-strike-ends-at-ice\r\n- Gustavo Sagrero Alavarez, \u201cICE Detainees at Tacoma Reportedly on Day 3 of Hunger Strike, NPR-KUOW (Feb. 3, 2023) available at https://www.kuow.org/stories/ice-detainees-in-tacoma-reportedly-on-day-three-of-hunger-strike\r\n- Mantak Singh, \u201cCommunities rallies for hunger strikers at Tacoma Northwest Detention Center,\u201d Fight Back News (Feb. 7, 2023) available at http://www.fightbacknews.org/2023/2/7/community-rallies-hunger-strikers-tacoma-northwest-detention-center\r\n\r\nThe records we seek will serve a vital role in informing the public regarding the conditions that led to the hunger strike, the response of the NWIPC to individual hunger strikers, concessions NWIPC made to demands, and violations of ICE standards committed in responding to the hunger strike. These records will assist the public in assessing the statements of corporate and government officials characterizing conduct people inside have described as abusive. \r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request by taking the following statutorily required actions: \r\n1. Make a determination on the Expedited Processing request within 10 calendar days (on or before February 27, 2023). \r\n2. Acknowledge this request and assign it an individualized tracking number within 10 working days (on or before March 2, 2023). \r\n3. Make a determination on whether the agency will respond to this request within 20 working days (on or before March 16, 2023). \r\n4. Provide an estimated date of records production. \r\n5. Make all responsive, reasonably segregable, non-exempt records promptly available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
