Mr. Park was a leftist academic. He was involved in the founding of RADACADS (short for \"RADical ACADemics\") at Harvard University and in the Maoist International Movement. He co-edited the opinion page of the Michigan Daily while earning his doctorate at the University of Michigan. He sometimes used the pseudonyms \u201cMC3\u201d or \u201cMIM3\u201d. He was born in October 1962, although I am not sure of the date or place of his birth. He died on 17 May 2011. At the time of his death, he lived in Somerville, Massachusetts. He had previously lived in Hopewell Junction, New York. Proof of Mr. Park's death is attached.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) RADACADS (the \"RADical ACADemics\" group at Harvard)\r\n(2) Maoist International Movement",
