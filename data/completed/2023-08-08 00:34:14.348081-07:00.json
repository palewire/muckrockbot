Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

It is estimated that it will take this employee 2.7 hours to complete their review and redaction of the emails which are not estimated to contain information subject to the attorney/client privilege or the attorney-work product doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee of the Department of Law, who in the reasonable discretion of the custodian of the records, has the necessary skill and training to perform the actions necessary to complete the search, retrieval, and redaction of the emails is $37.02 per hour.  It is estimated that it will take this employee 1.35 hours to complete their review and redaction of the emails which are estimated to contain information subject to the attorney/client privilege or the attorney-work product doctrine.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we estimate that the cost to complete the search, retrieval, and redaction of the records which you have requested to be $98.57. Upon your agreement to move forward, we will provide you with payment instructions.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, feel free to modify your request to reduce cost.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nKimberly",

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to Clayland Boyden Gray. Mr. Gray was a lawyer and diplomat who served as White House Counsel from 1989 to 1993 and as U.S. Ambassador to the European Union from 2006 to 2007. He was born on 6 February 1943 in Winston-Salem, NC, USA. He died on 21 May 2023.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in numerous national media, including the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/obituaries/c-boyden-gray-dead.html and the Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/05/21/c-boyden-gray-white-house-counsel-president-ghw-bush-dies-80/.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) President George Herbert Walker Bush, to whom the subject served as White House Counsel\r\n(2) Chief Justice Earl Warren, to whom the subject was a law clerk\r\n(3) The Atlantic Counsel, on whose board the subject served\r\n(4) The European Institute, on whose board the subject served\r\n(5) FreedomWorks, on whose board the subject served\r\n(6) The Federalist Society, of which the subject was a member\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray was a public figure. He served as White House Counsel to George H. W. Bush and was the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. News obituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other national media. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Given Mr. Gray's government service as a high-level advisor and employee in the executive and judicial branches, the public's understanding of Mr. Gray, his work, and the work of the government will likely be enhanced significantly.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just an inquisitive citizen. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this request.",

        "communication": "Dear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver for my FOIPA Request No. 1593177-000 .\r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2. My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of his death appearing in major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political scientists, scholars, the legal academy, and many others. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.\r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Your request mentioned: \"To Whom It May Concern, \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, s. 286.011, F.S., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioral health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in [adult] correctional detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following: \r\n\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioral health services provisions at all locations where adults are incarcerated within your jurisdiction. \r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management, access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies. \r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for adult inmates. \r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioral health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of the adult justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records. \r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nBailey Pillon \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdepartment-corrections-3972%252Fpublic-records-request-health-and-mental-healthcare-in-fldoc-148724%252F%253Femail%253Dfloridadoc%252540govqa.us&url_auth_token=AAAWMOa3jYPTuyLzlUJyKbyIC_8%3A1qHGhP%3AVx3u-mnRwwPWFj0V98f1-ln7QLHtPIUKfny10x9Ys8s\" Please be advised the Florida Department of Corrections does not use any other records portal except for our records portal that has been authorized, GovQA. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please respond to this email with your questions or concerns. \r\nSincerely, \r\nDelacey Parramore \r\nGovernment Operations Consultant I \r\nPublic Records Unit \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nDear\u00a0Mrs. Bailey Pillon: \r\nThank you for your interest in public records of Florida Department of Corrections.

You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question.\u00a0 If there is a cost associated with your request, prior to any records being prepared for release, you will need to make payment on the invoice that is issued in response to the responsive records. Once payment is received, the responsive records will be prepared for release, including the redaction of information that is exempt from public record.\u00a0 This process will be done in order of payment receipt. \r\nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when you have information to review or respond to, as well as at each step of the request through completion.\u00a0 Again, thank you for using the Florida Department of Corrections Public Records Portal. https://floridadoc.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=19383&coid=",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Eugene Norman Yulish (June 9, 1931 \u2013\r\n    January 19, 2020), known as Gene London, who was the host of a long-running,\r\n    Philadelphia local children's television show, Cartoon Corners (a.k.a.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

This search is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The Supreme Court has recognized that FOIA \"reflects our nation's fundamental commitment to open government\" (New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971) and that the government has a \"heavy burden\" to prove that information should be kept secret (id.). FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed, and the government has the burden of proving that the information requested is exempt from disclosure (United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 1989).\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is as comprehensive as possible, I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nFlight Logs: Please provide all records related to the helicopter flight, including but not limited to flight logs that detail the flight paths and actions taken during the flight. These records should include information about the time of takeoff and landing, the duration of the flight, and any stops made during the flight.\r\nVideo Logs: Please provide all video logs captured by the helicopter's onboard cameras during the flight. These logs should include all footage captured during the flight, including footage of any stops made during the flight.\r\nTransmissions: Please provide all records of transmissions between the helicopter and ground personnel or any other parties during the flight. These records should include any audio recordings or written transcripts of these transmissions.\r\nMaintenance and Safety Records: Please provide any records related to the helicopter's maintenance and safety inspections, as well as the pilot's certifications and qualifications.\r\nWeather and Air Traffic Information: Please provide all weather and air traffic information that was available to the pilot during the flight.\r\nPilot Logbook: Please provide the pilot's logbook for the flight, which should include the pilot's flight hours, certifications, and qualifications.\r\nFlight Plan: Please provide the flight plan for the helicopter flight, including any revisions made to the plan before or during the flight.\r\nCommunications between DEP and Other Agencies: Please provide any records of communications between the DEP and other agencies related to the helicopter flight.\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: Please provide any body-worn camera footage that was recorded by DEP personnel during the flight, if available.\r\nRecords of Stops or Interactions: Please provide any records related to any stops or interactions that occurred during the flight, including but not limited to any reports or logs of interactions with members of the public or other agencies.\r\nThe courts have held that agencies must conduct a \"reasonable search\" for records responsive to a FOIA request, and that the adequacy of an agency's search is to be judged by the reasonableness of the efforts made, not by the results achieved (Electronic Privacy Information Center v. United States Department of Homeland Security, 2006). I would like to request that these records be provided to me in an electronic format, if possible, to reduce the cost and time associated with printing and mailing.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of these records is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, please provide an explanation of the basis for the exemption, consistent with the courts' holding that FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed and that the government has the burden of proving that information should be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of FBI file 29B-WF-171994 as well as copies of any files whose\r\n    numbers appear in 29B-WF-171994.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The city is providing records containing information regarding the incident identified in your request as required by Cal Gov Code\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a07923.610 and 7923.615. The city has redacted the full name of the juvenile victims in this case pursuant to Cal Gov Code\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a07922.000, 7927.705 and 7930.100 (Cal. Const., Art. I, \u00a7\u00a01,\u00a0and Art 1, \u00a7 28). Pursuant to Cal Gov Code\u00a0\u00a7 7922.000, the city has determined that the public interest served by not disclosing the full names of the victims clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure because the rights of victims of crime and their families in criminal prosecutions are a subject of grave statewide concern and crime victims are entitled to privacy and to be treated with respect and dignity. The crime victims\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy and respect clearly outweighs the public\u2019s interest in obtaining the full last name of juvenile victims of a crime that occurred 13 years ago. To the extent this is a denial of your request, Assistant City Attorney Allegra Frost is responsible for that denial. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 442-339-2808. \r\nSincerely, \r\nFaviola Medina \r\nCity Clerk Services Manager \r\nCity Clerk Services",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe information that you are seeking can be found in NR #23-5227.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to documents held by the Miami-Dade Department of Education related to books that have been banned or removed from schools due to their connection to Critical Race Theory (CRT) or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the Miami-Dade Department of Education can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the Florida Sunshine Law. Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the Miami-Dade Department of Education to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the Florida Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference case law that affirms the public's right to access government records under the Florida Sunshine Law. One key case is Times Publishing Co. v. Williams, 222 So. 2d 470 (Fla. 2d DCA 1969), which held that the public has a right to access government records and that any exemptions to the FOIA must be narrowly construed. Another important case is Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County v. Dain, 719 So. 2d 1063 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998), which held that a government agency must provide a specific justification for withholding or redacting information under an exemption to the FOIA.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the decision-making process behind the banning or removal of books from schools due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. This may include but is not limited to any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this decision-making process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to any complaints or challenges made against books due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. This may include but is not limited to any correspondence or communication between the Miami-Dade Department of Education and individuals or groups involved in such challenges or complaints.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am requesting a list of all books that have been banned or removed from schools in Florida due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. Please provide the title, author, and reason for the banning or removal of each book.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

The staff of the Office of Academics and Transformation has provided my office with the three attached records relative to your request. Staff has advised these books were removed due to inappropriate content for age group.\r\n\r\n* A Court of Mist and Fury\r\n* Daddy's Roommate\r\n* Fates and Furies\r\n\r\nThese books were neither objected to, nor challenged. However, through an audit, they were identified as being inappropriate due to the adult content and sexually charged language utilized throughout the books. Attached are the reviews from Follet's Titlewave platform that identifies the books as either being Adult or Young Adult (Age 17) in nature. Note that Daddy's Roommate is now an archived title in Titlewave and therefore may be removed from libraries. These books were only located in four of our libraries, and the singular copies were weeded out.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, staff has advised there are no records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to any complaints or challenges made against books due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes as no challenges or complaints have been filed to-date.\r\n\r\nM-DCPS does not maintain a record of all books that have been banned or removed from schools in Florida due to any circumstances or criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlissa S.

In most cases, your request will be processed in two to four weeks, or sooner.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City may invoke an extension of time to determine if there is a need to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search for and collect the requested records from field facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search for and examine a voluminous number of records.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Consult with another agency or City departments having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Compile data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your request is to review records (rather than receive copies), an appointment will be made with you for review once the records are gathered.\u00a0 Please note:\u00a0 If any responsive documents are copyrighted they can only be viewed in house.\u00a0 No duplicate or photos are allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a charge for the direct cost of duplication pursuant to the City\u2019s Book of fees.

If you are unable to pick-up or view your records during this time period, notification is required or your request will be considered fulfilled and a new request must be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain records are generally exempt for disclosure pursuant to Government Code Section 6255, where the public interest served by not making the records public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the records.

Your request was received in this office on 4/6/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.

You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.
