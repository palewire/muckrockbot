Please task a search that would yield UAP drone reports where the operator and origin has not been identified.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your timely cooperation and response. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 C.F.R 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing. I provide the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746, declaring that they are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. Recent reports of UAP have created a subject of exceptional and widespread media interest about which there exists questions regarding the government\u2019s conduct..\r\nSee, e.g., and sources cited in paragraphs below.\r\n A. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drone-sightings-spread-new-jersey-officials-express-outrage-federal-re-rcna184107 \r\n B. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drones-new-jersey-what-we-know/\r\n C. https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings/index.html\r\n D. https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-0f4aba00748ac464d42270fbe7457733\r\n E.  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-we-know-about-the-mysterious-drones-flying-over-new-jersey\r\n F. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/12/11/unexplained-reports-of-drones-flying-over-new-york-new-jersey-and-pennsylvania-heres-what-we-know/\r\n\r\n2. Beginning on or around November 18, 2024, multiple reports of UAP over the skies of New Jersey began to pour in. \r\n\r\n3. The UAP sightings occurred above one of the homes of the President-elect, and highly sensitive U.S. military installations, including the Picatinny Arsenal (see https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/picatinny-arsenal.html). \r\n\r\n4. DHS is reportedly assisting in the federal coordination of the government\u2019s response to these UAP reports. https://defensescoop.com/2024/12/12/new-jersey-unidentified-drones-dod-poised-to-respond-if-threaten-military-assets/; https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-a978470fa3bb07ed3e98c5b7c18f0abb\r\n\r\n5. On December 13, DHS and FBI released a joint statement regarding this response: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/12/12/joint-dhsfbi-statement-reports-drones-new-jersey. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/ \r\n\r\n6. To date, despite abundant video evidence, official confirmation from law enforcement and state officials, and federal lawmakers\u2019 questions, the government is unable to identify the origin, operator, or technological nature of the phenomena. https://www.npr.org/2024/12/11/nx-s1-5226000/new-jersey-drones.\r\n \r\n7. Instead, senior White House officials appear to dispute what people, including law enforcement officers, are witnessing and recording. https://www.twz.com/air/white-house-says-none-of-the-new-jersey-visual-drone-sightings-have-been-corroborated. \r\n\r\n8. Congress has held briefings on these phenomena; they produced no definitive answers from the U.S. government. https://ktxs.com/news/nation-world/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites; https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites\r\n\r\n9. In the absence of definitive, public assessments, elected officials are considering a limited declaration of emergency: https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/12/10/New-Jersey-Jon-Bramnick-drones-UAP-UFO-limited-emergency/9881733858673/. \r\n\r\n10.  Congress previously required collection of UAP records by no later than February 2024 in sections 1841-43of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act\u2019s adaptation of the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/.  \r\n\r\n11. The White House has declared the sightings are not attributable to a foreign nation. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/13/drones-over-new-jersey-white-house-lawmakers/76956011007/. \r\n\r\n12. Government officials, including DOD\u2019s Susan Gough, have stated that the UAP activity is not attributable to a U.S. research program. \r\n\r\n13. At least one U.S. Senator has called for U.S. military assets to shoot down these UAP, notwithstanding the publicly stated position of federal and state officials that they are not hostile, not experimental, and not identified. https://abc7ny.com/post/new-jersey-drones-us-senator-says-mystery-devices-spotted-nj-should-shot-down-necessary/15647143/. \r\n\r\n14. True to form, New Jersey residents have also suggested taking matters into their own hands and shooting down the phenomena as well. https://www.foxnews.com/us/drones-mystery-new-jersey-homeowners-threaten-take-matters-own-hands-govt-doesnt-act.\r\n\r\n15. In the absence of clear, consistent communications from U.S. officials, heightened tensions regarding the inability or unwillingness of the government to explain what is happening above the skies of New Jersey, there is an increasing risk to the health and safety of people who are making the reports and capturing the video images of whoever or whatever is visiting the Garden State.\r\n\r\n16. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Stuecker and team,\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughtful and prompt response to our open records request. We sincerely appreciate the data and links you provided, especially the self-report/referral breakdown and references to the Iowa Administrative Code and relevant statutes.\r\n\r\nWe understand the need for confidentiality in individual cases. However, we respectfully believe there may be a misunderstanding regarding the scope of Iowa Code \u00a721.5(g). While this provision clearly protects specific case discussions or investigative matters, it does not appear to prohibit disclosure of general policies, administrative procedures, or contractual agreements that govern the operation of the Physician Health Program (PHP). Such documents are essential for public transparency and are not inherently protected merely by their association with a confidential program.\r\n\r\nBecause this issue is a central component of our national research into PHP structures and oversight, we kindly submit the following follow-up requests:\r\n\r\nAny contracts or memoranda of understanding between the Iowa Medical Board and the Iowa PHP or any third-party entities managing physician monitoring, including the Professional Assistance Program.\r\n\r\nThese may be redacted as needed to protect names or private health information.\r\n\r\nMeeting minutes from the Physician Health Committee (or equivalent) between 2019 and 2024, specifically those addressing program operations, procedural updates, or structural evaluations.\r\n\r\nWe are not seeking identifiable physician information and are happy to accept redacted copies if necessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, we respectfully encourage your department to consider conducting or commissioning an internal audit or outcomes assessment of the program\u2019s long-term effectiveness, including return-to-practice metrics, physician feedback, and support outcomes. We note that the absence of such data is common among many states, but also represents a gap in quality assurance that merits attention.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time, cooperation, and ongoing commitment to public service. We look forward to your reply and will gladly work with your office to clarify any aspects of this request.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,",

You requested the following: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nA log of all emails to/from the Kylie Kosmacek, from March 1, 2025 - March 31, 2025. \r\n\r\n1.

The search parameters you provided yielded an initial count of approximately 5,385 lines of emails and attachments. \r\nIn order to comply with this request, each and every of the approximate 5,385 lines in this log would have to be reviewed to determine if it is exempt from disclosure. In the employee\u2019s role as a director in safety operations and programs, there are many subject lines naming students that pertain to their well-being, as well as addresses of various incidents in subject lines that would have to be manually determined and cross-referenced to determine if they pertain to a student\u2019s home address or not. As such, the processing and reviewing such a large volume of records for responsiveness as well as for information exempt from release under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, such as personally private information and information exempt from disclosure under the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA) would be estimated to take dozens of hours. Moreover, your request fails to establish a public interest and such request would clearly burden the operations of CPS beyond the public interest in this information. \r\nThis is not an automatic denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), the District is extending an opportunity to confer to narrow your request to more manageable proportions, such as providing keywords or additional specific custodians within five (5) business days. If you choose not to do so, this response will be considered denied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g). \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (personal descriptions, employee ID numbers, personal addresses, personal email addresses, names of potential job candidates, etc.) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Section 7(1)(n) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201cRecords relating to a public body's adjudication of employee grievances or disciplinary cases; however, this exemption shall not extend to the final outcome of cases in which discipline is imposed.\u201d You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

While it is my understanding the Paperwork Reduction Act does not necessarily require publishing changes sought from OMB, it is difficult, if not impossible, to making meaningful public comments to OMB about the proposed changes.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Education claims the proposed changes will decrease the public burden by OVER TWO MILLION HOURS. This is a substantial change. Therefore, I am requesting a fee waiver, as the Department of Education press release states, but does not specify, vague policy changes. It is in the public interest to understand these policy changes, how it may impact public burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and how other organizations who rely on the FAFSA, including state universities, will be affected by these changes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKarl Koscher",

        "communication": "Andrew Free \r\nN/A \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR138080 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2023-ICFO-07519 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 12/20/2022.  You have requested all processing notes, taskers, initial receipting documents, and any other records relating to the ICE FOIA Office\u2019s processing of 2023-ICFO-06896 and 2023-ICFO-05446.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for records responsive to your request produced 4 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 4 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMegan Davis \r\nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\t4 Pages \r\nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.",
