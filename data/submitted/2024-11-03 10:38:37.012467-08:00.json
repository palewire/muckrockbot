If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction.

If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a01.6(a)(1)(D) information (in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to EO 13526)\r\nl.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available.

Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)).

If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a01.6(a)(1)(D) information (in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to EO 13526)\r\nl.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available.

If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material.

For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Justice - FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Health and Human Services,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Department of State,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Housing and Urban Development,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Labor,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Department Of Agriculture, Office of the Secretary,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(a) mandates prompt availability of public agency records, especially where issues directly impact public welfare and accountability.\r\n\r\nJustification for Expedited Processing\r\nPublic Interest and Transparency: These records are crucial for public scrutiny of Medicaid spending, potential monopolistic practices, consumer choice limitations, and wage compliance within Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\n\r\nImmediate Impact on Vulnerable Populations: This request addresses policies that may limit autonomy, financial independence, and housing security for Medicaid beneficiaries, especially those with disabilities. Delays could harm these populations by preventing timely corrective action.\r\n\r\nCompliance with FOIA Promptness Standards: Federal and Connecticut FOIA statutes require agencies to make records available \u201cpromptly.\u201d Any refusal to expedite processing would contravene both the letter and intent of FOIA law.\r\n\r\nPotential Financial and Legal Violations: Requested records may reveal misuse of Medicaid funds or improper labor practices. Immediate access is necessary for regulatory assessment.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Acknowledgment: Please provide immediate, written acknowledgment of this expedited processing request. If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",
