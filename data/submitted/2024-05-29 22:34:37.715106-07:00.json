        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the DC Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear Sirs:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, on behalf of Targeted Justice Inc. I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to Targeted Justice, Inc.:\r\n1) All the reports by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on Applications for Delayed-Notice Search Warrants and Extensions drafted and/or published pursuant to the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, documenting the number of applications for warrants and extensions of warrants authorizing delayed notice granted or denied during the each  fiscal year since 2005.\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing Targeted Justice currently has over 15,000 subscribers in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that the request does not respond to any \u201ccommercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject. If you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\nSincerely\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\r\nfor\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O.

The DME presumably concluded their investigation long ago. \r\n\r\nPlease search for a coroner's report(s) that could be labeled as \"exam protocol\", \"medical report\", \"case report\" or \"investigator's narrative.\"\r\n\r\n I am hopeful that the release of information will assist in the identification of this person.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Town of Jupiter,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI would like to request the phone records for Officer Diana Zeitz between the dates of 01/06/24 and 01/16/24, No filters are needed, raw data is fine. This is now the second request to the town, please reference the attached police records request invoice (Paid on Receipt).\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive conversation with Mr. King Wekenmann from IS (The Town of Jupiter's IT Department) on 5/28/2024 at 1:50pm, He explained that the desk phone service from this request during my time frame of 1/6/2024/-1/16/2024 were provided by AT&T, the records in the custody of AT&T during that time period are public records. As for Cell Phones, police department employees either used AT&T FirstNet or used personal cellphones that would be subsidized by the Town. So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, it is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or an unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone and/or the carrier. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (i.e. call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any fees associated pertaining to this request, I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment and/or download link as per Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",

This request includes but is not limited to the initial report, detective case findings and notes, list of suspects, interview notes, leads followed, tips reported and investigated as well as results to possible DNA test requests made in relation to found human remains (as reported in local news outlets in recent years). \r\n\r\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department's website section on missing persons states the associated LMPD report number being 80-05-001813 with NamUs Case number MP6161 and NCMEC case number 1007015. \r\n\r\nAmy's unsolved disappearance is quickly approaching the 20th year anniversary mark. I understand due to the age of this case some files may not be easily accessible. \r\n\r\nI expect this request to be filled in an accessible format, including screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf and image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news/media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between April 15, 2024, and May 28, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Jaspal Singh died in ICE custody on April 15, 2024. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/indian-national-ice-custody-dies-hospital\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Charles Leo Daniel who died March 7, 2024, and before that, in the cases Frankline Okpu and Salvador Vargas, to name just a few.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Singh is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. ICE has engaged a pattern and practice of violating its own policy and Congressional appropriations requirements by failing to post death reports within the 30-day period following detainee deaths.\r\n7. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Folkston facility.\r\n8. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Singh's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Singh's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Folkston facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nIf there are emails forwarded with the same thread, please include those as well. If there are emails that are bcc please provide clear data on recipients, and if they are voice mail please include the sound file. Include everything touching these emails when in doubt.\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets.

Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3.

They did not necessarily occur in a school and may have occurred outside of a school. The spreadsheet details where a report was submitted by an officer and there was no OFFENDER listed.  The age listed was extracted from the database on the incident date. The CAD Incident type was added to give a sense of the activity involved. The officer listed is not necessarily an arresting officer but was apparently involved in the incident.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can help you with anything else.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\nCheryl Kozlosky\r\nHead Clerk\r\nLynn Police Department\r\n781-477-4382",

When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. \r\n2.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request metadata relating to emails sent with the following text strings anywhere in the body or subject line, partial or complete:\r\n\r\n1 - emails originating or sent to domain 'zugallery.com'\r\n14- containing text \"Zu Gallery\"\r\n\r\nInclude any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: or any other emails.\r\n\r\nPlease aggregate by the five categories and provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2012 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts to include:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields. In particular, PDF has been noticed to obscure bcc and cc recipients, which may be seen as intentional. Please release in .csv as other Colorado organizations have chosen to do.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBureau records related to a cartoonist and web designer named Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Richards (born October 20th, 1946 - died April 21st, 2023) was a cartoonist in the 1960s and 70s. His work was frequently featured in publications such as The Berkeley Tribe. His death was widely reported, and a news report regarding his passing should be attached, and can be viewed at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2023/04/24/ted-richards-rip/\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the Cartoonist Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a thorough search for any records on Richards held by the Cincinnati, San Francisco and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Please note, there appears to have been a previous FOIA request with the bureau for records related to The Berkeley Tribe (FOIA: 1394913-0). Much of that file, which is currently accessible on the Internet Archive, appears to be heavily redacted. Please re-examine The Berkeley Tribe release in relation to the release of documents related to Theodore Richards. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the work that the bureau does, and for the bureau's commitment to transparency. I look forward to the resolution of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
