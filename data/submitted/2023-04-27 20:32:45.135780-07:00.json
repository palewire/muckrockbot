        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID FA865019C6055, for a contract given to General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (UEI: SMNWM6HN79X5) in the research area of \"BIOEFFECTS RESEARCH OF DIRECTED ENERGY EFFECTS (BRDEE)\". This contract has an action date of August 30, 2019, and was funded by the Department of Defense through the Department of Air Force. This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. and/or its parent company, General Dynamics Corp (UEI: F58HFRNGEL8)\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into the physical effects of directed energy attacks, as currently there is a concern among the members of the media and the public about so-called anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2016, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents under the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request all records related to the criminal investigation of Aaron Swartz, including any records related to his alleged unauthorized access of the JSTOR academic database. Specifically, I am seeking all memos, documents, and inter-agency communications related to the investigation, prosecution, and settlement of the case. This includes any search warrants, surveillance records, or other investigative documents related to the case. Additionally, I am requesting any and all records related to the prosecution of Aaron Swartz, including court filings, briefs, and other legal documents.\r\n\r\nAs this is a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I would like to remind you of your obligation to provide access to all non-exempt responsive records. Please note that any redactions or withholdings of responsive records must be narrowly tailored and justified under the FOIA exemptions. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I request that you provide a detailed explanation for the basis of each such decision.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that my request is as clear and specific as possible, I am seeking records from any and all agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of Aaron Swartz, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and any other relevant agencies. This request specifically includes any and all records related to JSTOR, the academic database that was at the center of the allegations against Aaron Swartz.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting any and all records related to the following topics:\r\n\r\nThe initiation of the investigation: This includes any tips, complaints, or other information that led to the investigation, as well as any communications or documentation related to the decision to initiate the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe collection of evidence: This includes any search warrants, subpoenas, or other legal process used to gather evidence, as well as any documentation related to the collection and analysis of evidence, such as forensic reports, lab reports, and chain of custody documents.\r\n\r\nSurveillance and monitoring: This includes any surveillance or monitoring of Aaron Swartz, including wiretaps, pen registers, or other forms of electronic surveillance. This also includes any documentation related to the legal authorization for such surveillance, as well as any documentation related to the use and analysis of any surveillance or monitoring data.\r\n\r\nCommunications between agencies: This includes any communications between or among law enforcement agencies, including emails, memos, or other inter-agency communications related to the investigation or prosecution of Aaron Swartz.\r\n\r\nProsecution records: This includes any records related to the prosecution of Aaron Swartz, including court filings, legal briefs, and other legal documents.\r\n\r\nInter-agency coordination: This includes any records related to coordination and communication between agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of Aaron Swartz, including any task force meetings or other inter-agency meetings related to the case.\r\n\r\nRecords related to JSTOR: This includes any communications or agreements between law enforcement agencies and JSTOR, as well as any documents related to JSTOR's cooperation with the investigation or prosecution of Aaron Swartz.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the FOIA, there are several court cases that support the release of the responsive records. These include:\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-99 (1974): This case established that the need for confidentiality must be weighed against the public interest in disclosure, and that the public interest in disclosure must be given significant weight.\r\n\r\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Dep't of Justice, 602 F. Supp. 2d 121, 126-27 (D.D.C. 2009): This case established that FOIA requires agencies to conduct a search for responsive records that is reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\r\n\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Defense, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to release any reasonably segregable portion of a record that is not exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nElectronic Privacy Information Center v. Department of Homeland Security, 653 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011): This case held that agencies may not withhold responsive records under the FOIA unless they fall within one of the enumerated exemptions, and that any doubts regarding the disclosure of responsive records should be resolved in favor of disclosure.\r\n\r\nNew York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971): This case established that the public has a significant interest in the disclosure of government documents, and that the government may not withhold responsive records merely to avoid embarrassment or inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, I have attached proof of Aaron Swartz's death, as he tragically passed away in 2013. Please note that any requests to withhold or redact responsive records must be narrowly tailored and justified under the applicable laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to remind you that if any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I reserve the right to seek review of your decision through the appropriate administrative channels, including appeal to the Office of Information Policy (OIP) and filing a formal complaint in federal court to compel disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

The incident was investigated by the Virginia State Police and details were forwarded to your office.\r\n\r\nI assert that the records requested should be considered noncriminal records, noting that no criminal charges were filed. Additionally, no crime appears to have even allegedly occurred to have been investigated. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 2.2-3706 allows for withholding only \"identifying information of a personal, medical, or financial nature where the release of such information would jeopardize the safety or privacy of any person\" in noncriminal records. It should be noted that many of the details of the incident have already been widely reported in the media.\r\n\r\nI will also assert that while Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 2.2-3706 mandates the release of unattended death records to certain family members or next of kin, nothing in the statute prohibits or otherwise restricts access of these records to the public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically. When the records are ready, I will provide a link to a cloud-based service where the records may be easily uploaded.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically, I am requesting records regarding the FBI's handling of FOIA request guidelines and search programs, including keystring searches and searches used for interagency communication requests for digital memos, documents, emails, or paper documents on related subjects.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to reference the following relevant case law:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989): This case established the fundamental purpose of FOIA as providing the public with access to information that the government may not otherwise make available.\r\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Department of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2014): This case held that agencies must disclose any reasonably segregable portion of a record that is not exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\r\nNat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case established that agencies must provide a specific and legitimate justification for withholding any requested information.\r\nMilner v. Dep't of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011): This case held that agencies cannot withhold information under FOIA unless the requested information falls within a specific exemption.\r\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004): This case held that agencies must conduct an adequate search for requested information under FOIA.\r\nI kindly request any records, including policies, procedures, manuals, and training materials, that outline the FBI's guidelines and procedures for conducting searches in response to FOIA requests. I also request any records that detail the types of search programs or techniques utilized by the FBI in its FOIA search process, including keystring searches and interagency communication requests.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I kindly request any records, including digital memos, documents, emails, or paper documents, related to the FBI's handling of FOIA requests and search programs. These records should include any guidance provided to FBI personnel regarding the handling of FOIA requests and the methods used to search for responsive records.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the FBI has an obligation to provide the requested records unless they are exempt under FOIA. If the FBI withholds any requested records or deletes any responsive information, it must provide a detailed explanation for doing so.\r\n\r\nI kindly request expedited processing of this request, as the information sought is of great public interest and urgency. If expedited processing is not possible, please process this request in the normal course.\r\n\r\nFinally, if any portion of my request is denied, please provide the specific legal basis for the denial, including the FOIA exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf my request is denied in whole or in part, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the disclosure of the requested information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good afternoon Siobhan.  I am in receipt of your Right to Know request.  In New Hampshire we have two types of medical and residential facilities: those that are licensed only and those that are both licensed and certified.  Certified means that the facility is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to participate in those programs.  Examples of facilities that are licensed only include Residential Care Facilities, Supported Residential Health Care Facilities and Walk-in Care Facilities.  In other words, these are facilities that do not receive reimbursement from CMS.  Examples of facilities that are both licensed and certified include Hospitals, Nursing homes and most Ambulatory Surgical Centers.  Information relative to fines imposed against facilities that are licensed only is confidential under RSA 151:13 and is exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A:5,IV.  RSA 151:13 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n 151:13 Information Confidential. \u2013 Information received or created by the department of health and human services, through inspection or otherwise, authorized hereunder shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed publicly except in a proceeding involving the question of licensure or revocation of license pursuant to RSA 541-A. The department may disclose such information after it denies, suspends or revokes a license pursuant to RSA 151:7, II.\r\n\r\nDHHS does not impose fines against facilities that are certified.  Rather it is CMS that does that.  For the above reasons, your Right to Know request is denied due to the fact that DHHS does not have any public records that are responsive to your request.  Below is a link to the Enforcement Actions page of the CMS website.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnforcement Actions | CMS<https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency/enforcement-actions>\r\nPart C and Part D Enforcement Actions | CMS<https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Compliance-and-Audits/Part-C-and-Part-D-Compliance-and-Audits/PartCandPartDEnforcementActions->\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn B.

Kent, known as \"Norm Kent\" help found the South Florida Gay News publication. Kent was also an attorney and political activist. Kent was leader of the marijuana rights organization NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and provided legal representation to individual prosecuted on marijuana possession charges. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not needed as Norman Kent's death was widely reported in the media.  A copy of his obituary should be attached. Here's a link to an extensive news report on this death:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonblade.com/2023/04/13/norm-kent-co-founder-of-south-florida-gay-news-dies-at-73/\r\n\r\nOf particular interest would be bureau monitoring of Kent's writings in the Express Gay News or South Florida Gay News publications, as well as any records related to Kent's radio program. Other possible records might include Kent's legal representation of talk radio personality Neil Rogers. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Norman Elliott Kent. \r\n\r\nPlease include a survey of records at the Miami field office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Norman Elliott Kent.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's dedication to transparency, and I look forward to working as long as it takes to have any records, should they exist, be released.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) case files 105-HQ-8354  and 123-HQ-1568. A prior Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request, 1547783-000, was sent to the FBI for records on Christopher O. Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996), and the Bureau responded by identifying the aforementioned case file numbers as potentially responsive to the request and stating all subsequent records had been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Further, it recommended the filing of a FOIPA request through NARA's Special Access and Freedom of Information Act Program. Therefore, I am sending this request for access to FBI case files 105-HQ-8354  and 123-HQ-1568.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bird is identified in these records, there is no expectation of a violation of his privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
