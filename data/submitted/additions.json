Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are among the executive producers on the film, which was made through their Higher Ground Productions company. I request any and all documents pertaining to DoD support for \"Leave the World Behind.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Leave the World Behind,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
