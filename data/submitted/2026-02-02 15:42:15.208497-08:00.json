Any internal or external reviews, assessments, or guidelines used or produced by SDOT concerning the accessibility (including but not limited to compliance with ADA or pedestrian clear zones) of the proposed digital kiosk installations.\r\n4. All correspondence (including emails and attachments) between SDOT staff and the Office of the Mayor, the Seattle Disability Commission, the Seattle Design Commission, the Downtown Seattle Association, or IKE Smart City regarding the design, placement, permitting, or accessibility of interactive digital kiosks.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I requested these records on May 23, 2025, more than eight months ago, via request C226784-052325.

The Joplin Police Department's annual sUAS reports from 2017 to present.\r\n2.  The location these reports are published\r\n\r\n\r\nTo provide context, we have reason to believe these records exist because the police department policy on use of sUAS devices states that an annual report shall be published. Policy located here. The relevant text is in paragraph 3 of section E:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  The Chief of Police or his or her designee shall publish an annual report documenting the agency\u2019s deployment and use of sUAS devices.\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe have been unable to locate these reports.\r\n\r\nSince these reports are supposed to be easily accessible to the public we request the City waive all fees for this request. We request the City consider this request to waive fees despite the blanket policy of not waiving fees.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
