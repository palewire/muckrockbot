Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

This will acknowledge receipt of your November 15, 2022 public records request to Vancouver Public Schools, which was received by the District on January 3, 2023. It has come to the attention of the District's public records office that you submitted the initial request to a former email address that the district deactivated when the District migrated to the GovQA portal on April 26, 2022. In the process of responding to another public records request from a different Muckrock identifier, it was discovered that the previously deactivated email address was inadvertently reactivated in or around September 2022 when the district internet technology department changed the District's electronic email systems. The emails you submitted between November and December 2021 were not received by the District's public records office until a search of the previously deactivated email location occurred on January 3, 2023. \r\nThe District acknowledged the request on January 3, 2023 after the District reopened for business after the winter break (December 19, 2022 through January 2, 2023) It appears the initial response was mistakenly sent to the wrong Muckrock identifier (120965-29141669). The District herewith resubmits this response to the correct Muckrock identifier, listed above. \r\nYour request was forwarded to my office, which oversees all public records requests. \r\nRequest: \"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019. Note: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\" In April, 2022, Vancouver School District converted the management of all public records requests to the District's Public Records Request portal.\u00a0 The most effective and efficient way to communicate with the District regarding the status and responsive documents to your request is via your specific public records request log-in. The complete instructions for filing a public records request with Vancouver School District can be found via our website at: https://vansd.org/public-records-request/ We are in the process of identifying, gathering and reviewing documents responsive to your request. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.120, 137068-44146716 will be charged the following fees for production of the requested records: Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format and Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery. Contingent upon receipt of payment of the invoice, we estimate that we will be able to provide you with a first installment of records or records in their entirety on or before March 15, 2023. For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

        "communication": "3-27-23\r\n\r\nvia email to PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER Marilee.Scarbrough@vansd.org\r\n\r\nHello Vancouver Public Schools District Public Records Officer Scarbrough,\r\n\r\nI have been communicating with Vancouver Public Schools District Paralegal Jen Anderson since February regarding this public records request and your agency request for fees. \r\n\r\nIn multiple emails back and forth I had been attempting to work with Ms. Anderson to clarify your agency request for fees. What fees, how they are applied, what records would be produced based on the fee request, etc. It is very difficult to communicate with Ms. Anderson as she does not answer more than 1 question per email, if she chooses to answer questions regarding clarification at all.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Ms. Anderson has now informed me your agency has CLOSED this public records request due to non payment of fees. However I was discussing these fees with Ms. Anderson, and questions remained outstanding regarding my clarification requests.\r\n\r\nIt appears Ms. Anderson is choosing not to answer these simple clarification questions and your agency is now is CLOSING my public records request without producing the records requested.\r\n\r\nYour agency, Vancouver Public Schools District  is in violation of Washington State Law RCW 42.56 and Washington Administrative Code(s):\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 Responsibilities of agencies in processing requests.\r\n(3) Provide \"fullest assistance\" and \"most timely possible action.\" The act requires agencies to adopt and enforce reasonable rules to provide for the \"fullest assistance\" to a requestor. RCW 42.56.100. The \"fullest assistance\" principle should guide agencies when processing requests. In general, an agency should devote sufficient staff time to processing records requests, consistent with the act's requirement that fulfilling requests should not be an \"excessive interference\" with the agency's \"other essential functions.\" RCW 42.56.100. The agency should recognize that fulfilling public records requests is one of the agency's duties, along with its others.\r\nThe act also requires agencies to adopt and enforce rules to provide for the \"most timely possible action on requests.\" RCW 42.56.100. This principle should guide agencies when processing requests. It should be noted that this provision requires the most timely \"possible\" action on requests. This recognizes that an agency is not always capable of fulfilling a request as quickly as the requestor would like.\r\n(4) Communicate with requestor. Communication is usually the key to a smooth public records process for both requestors and agencies.2 Clear requests for a small number of records usually do not require predelivery communication with the requestor. However, when an agency receives a large or unclear request, the agency should communicate with the requestor to clarify the request. If a requestor asks for a summary of applicable charges before any copies are made, an agency must provide it. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(f). The requestor may then revise the request to reduce the number of requested copies. If the request is clarified or modified orally, the public records officer or designee should memorialize the communication in writing.\r\nFor large requests, the agency may ask the requestor to prioritize the request so that he or she receives the most important records first. If feasible, the agency should provide periodic updates to the requestor of the progress of the request. Similarly, the requestor should periodically communicate with the agency and promptly answer any clarification questions. Sometimes a requestor finds the records he or she is seeking at the beginning of a request. If so, the requestor should communicate with the agency that the requested records have been provided and that he or she is canceling the remainder of the request. If the requestor's cancellation communication is not in writing, the agency should confirm it in writing.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication constructive notice of our intent to seek relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of January 26, 2023, Reference # R000330-012623.\r\nDear requests@muckrock.com,\r\nWe have not received your payment for Public Records requested by you on January 26, 2023 with Request Number R000330-012623, so your request is now considered abandoned.\r\nWe have previously notified you that payment must be received prior to release of the records but we have not received the payment after 30 days.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Belle,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office. The Controller serves as the chief accounting officer and auditor for the City and County of San Francisco. The Controller's Office is responsible for governance and conduct of key aspects of the City's financial operations, including operating the City's financial systems and issuing its financial procedures, maintaining the City's internal control environment, processing payroll for City employees, managing the City's bonds and debt portfolio, and processing and monitoring the City's budget. The department audits and produces regular reports on the City's financial and economic condition and the operations and performance of City government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Public Records Act requires an agency to make available to any person a copy of an, \u201cidentifiable record or records\u201d in its possession (California Government Code \u00a77922.530(a) (formerly \u00a76253(b)).) The City\u2019s obligation under the Sunshine Ordinance, like the California Public Records Act, is to produce public records in its custody (San Francisco Administration Code \u00a767.20(b).) There is no requirement that a department or officer construct a document to meet the specifications of the request. Your request is so open-ended and all-encompassing that it must be narrowed to meet this identifiability standard. The Controller's Office is available to assist you in formulating a request that meets that standard. Please feel free to contact us for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also find links below to online tools including SFOpenBook, DataSF and SFController Reports, where the Public has 24/7 access to City budget, financial, supplier and operating data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* SFOpenBook -\u00a0https://openbook.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* DataSF -\u00a0https://datasf.org\r\n\r\n* SFController -\u00a0Reports Search\r\n\r\n* CCSF\u2019s Public Records Requests -\u00a0https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com\r\n\r\n* CCSF Index to Records -\u00a0https://index.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* CCSF Board of Supervisors Legislation &amp; Related Reporting -\u00a0https://sfgov.legistar.com/Legislation.aspx\r\n\r\n* San Francisco Sales Tax Map\u00a0-\u00a0http://sfstax.hdlgov.com/geodata/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaire Stone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Controller\r\n\r\nCity and County of San Francisco\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City and County of San Francisco.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing SummerCon AKA CyberView, one of the oldest\r\n    hacker conventions, and the longest running such conference in the US.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, seeking records related to law enforcement officer certification in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including ABC News, KQED, MuckRock and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking two categories of certification records:   \r\n\r\n* All certified officers \r\nAll law enforcement officers who are actively certified as of the date of this request (or when the request is processed). If your system maintains historical records of previously certified officers who are no longer active, please include them as far back as possible. If correctional officers are certified by your agency, please include them as well.  \r\n\r\n* Decertified officers\r\nAll law enforcement officers who have been decertified through revocations, voluntary surrenders, suspensions or any other actions going back as far as possible. Please include records for decertified correctional officers if available. \r\n\r\nData elements for certified officers:\r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST or state certification ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency start date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s previous departments/agencies (employment history), with start and end dates\r\n* Officer\u2019s positions and/or ranks at previous departments or agencies\r\n* Officer\u2019s original date of certification\r\n* Current status of certification (active, lapsed, expired, suspended, etc.)\r\n* Last action taken on certification\r\n* Date of last action on certification \r\n* Disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Dates of disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Training history/additional certifications of this officer, if available\r\n\r\nData elements for decertified officers: \r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence.\r\n* Officer\u2019s last department/agency, with start and end date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Decertification action taken (revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, etc.)\r\n* Date decertification action taken\r\n* POST case number, if applicable\r\n* Reason for decertification or similar action\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nElisabeth Gawthrop \r\nData Journalist \r\nAmerican Public Media Research Lab \r\n317-410-7884",

Data practices law requires entities to allow viewing of data records when they are in a format that does not exist in a different format. Under Minnesota law, and most other states that I\u2019m aware of, the responding entity is not required to create additional reports or new formats to produce data that it has provided or is already providing. Historically, requestors would have to come into the office to view certain records, in this case we are providing it in an online format. If you want to access the individual disciplinary records or training records, you may download them from the public portal.\r\n\r\nAgain, in this case, between the two formats, you are receiving all of the data requested and POST is under no obligation to produce the same data in a different format. The entity providing the data is not under any obligation to create a method or configure software to produce the data already provided. We expended significant expense to create an API to display the data in the public portal.\r\n\r\nErik Misselt - Executive Director\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D96091.1D3D6EB0]\r\nBoard of Peace Officer Standards and Training\r\n1600 University Avenue, Suite 200, Saint Paul, MN 55104\r\nMain: (651) 643-3060  |  www.post.state.mn.us<http://www.post.state.mn.us>\r\nDirect # 651-201-7789\r\nerik.misselt@state.mn.us<mailto:erik.misselt@state.mn.us>\r\n\r\nNOTICE: The information contained in (and attached to) this e-mail is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the designated recipient(s) named above.

Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

Imperial Tobacco PLC, between January 1, 2020 and present.\"  Based on what you have requested, I have to run email searches separate from the OSH inspection information because emails are maintained in a separate system. Due to the sensitive nature of emails, I am the only authorized person within the agency with all email access who may run such a search.\r\nTo date, I have attempted to run the requested company names in a myriad of ways, but because of the commonality of several words  (e.g., alliance, brands, tobacco) and your request for \"all of the agency's email correspondence\" (no specific NC Dept of Labor employee), I am getting thousands of emails that include those words; further, the search must be run through all 350+ NCDOL employees, so each search is taking several hours to run.  I then have to review the emails to see if the email is applicable to your request, such as only referring to \"Alliance One International\" instead of some other Alliance One reference.  I have continued to attempt to refine the searches, in an attempt to produce a more reasonable-sized list. Please be advised that based on my prior attempts, I must advise you that it will  take me extensive time to go through such information.\r\nIs there a way you can refine your request or narrow the time frame?  Are there any specific NCDOL employees that may have been corresponding with these companies or are there specific email addresses within those named companies that I could use to refine the search?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJill F.

I relate this information to you primarily because the terms you indicated (green tobacco illness, heat stress) probably will have little to no connections directly the listed tobacco companies in relation to potential Occupational Safety and Health complaints.\r\n\r\nIn relation to that, growers or Farm Labor Contractors (FLC) would be the more likely employer of workers.  The FLC\u2019s generally recruit and hire seasonal or temporary agricultural laborers; in addition, they may also transport, house, and provide meals for workers.  FLC\u2019s are required to obtain a federal certification: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/agriculture/mspa/farm-labor-contractors.   Here is an actual US Department of Labor news release: https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210804-0.  Further, H2A workers fare certified under the authority of the US Department of Labor; see this article: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/agriculture/h2a/final-rule\r\n\r\nPlease also be apprised that NC Department of Labor participates in an advisory capacity to a group that also includes Alliance One International, Inc. The group is the Farm Labor Practices Group (FLPG), which states that it \u201cis a multi-stakeholder initiative, formed in 2012, committed to improving labor practices on farms and thereby enhancing the farmworker\u2019s experience.  The FLPG brings together key voices representing different sectors and perspectives, including growers/farmers, worker advocates, manufacturers and others who sell agricultural products, and government agencies.  The work of the FLPG is facilitated by a third party, the Keystone Policy Center, and includes the following member organizations.\u201d https://farmlaborpracticesgroup.org/about-us/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.keystone.org/our-work/agriculture/farm-labor-practices-group/\r\n\r\n\u2022           Alliance One International, Inc.

In relation to FLPG, she noted that many concerns related to FLCs are outside of the scope of the NC Department of Labor\u2019s statutory authority.  Examples include wage issues (because they fall under USDOL and not NCDOL), contractual violations, visa fraud, recruitment concerns, human trafficking (all of which are outside of this agency\u2019s statutory authority). Therefore, there will be multiple emails included related to this group.  If you do NOT want any of these emails, please let me know.\r\n\r\nI created another pdf that I attempted to attach, but it is too large; I will have to recreate it into smaller files.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Dear J Ader, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on March 08, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on March 16, 2023. You requested: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nA CSV export of your agency's Email Aliases (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/email/add-another-email-alias-for-a-user?view=o365-worldwide ) including the following parameters for every shared mailbox: \r\n\r\n- Primary SMTP Address \r\n- Name of the alias \r\n- Name of Mailbox \r\n\r\nA simple way to retrieve this is by having a member of IT (such as a System Administrator) run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell (if email is hosted in a Microsoft Exchange environment): \r\n\r\nGet-Mailbox | Select-Object DisplayName,RecipientType,PrimarySmtpAddress, @{Name=\"Aliases\";Expression={$_.EmailAddresses | Where-Object {$_ -clike \"smtp:*\"}}} | Export-Csv ./email_aliases.csv \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \r\n\r\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \r\nWe have redacted under Section 7(1)(c) certain City issued email addresses.\u00a0 As publicly-available certain City issued email addresses\u00a0would subject these employees to invasive and unsolicited communications, the disclosure of this information would burden employees\u2019 privacy interest. Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v.

The request was for records related to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Council on School Health (COSH), including any communications or correspondence between the school district and these organizations, or any other party that may have provided information to the district from these organizations. To help identify responsive records, I requested a search of specific terms.\r\n\r\nAs of today's date, I have not received a response to my FOIL request. Therefore, I am appealing the lack of response and request that you conduct a diligent search for responsive records and provide them to me in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to modify my original request to narrow the affiliated organizations list to remove references to \"pediatric,\" \"child health,\" and \"school health.\" This modification will allow for a more specific and reasonable description of the records being requested.\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of the district's obligations under LGS-01 to retain records until any appeal has been resolved. If any records are withheld, please provide an explanation of the legal basis for the withholding.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We are responding to a request that you sent to an email box in our District that is not used to receive or respond to public records requests. The email box is not monitored for new requests or requester responses. When you emailed your request, you should have received an automatic reply directing you to this portal or US Mail.\u00a0 We noticed that you did not create a new request, therefore, we created one for you. Please discontinue sending requests and responses to all email boxes in the District. We have set up several ways to receive and respond to public records requests. For more information, login into our website at http://https//www.highlineschools.org/departments/records/public-records. We also received a duplicate request from you Reference # P000443-121322. Would you like to withdrawal one of the duplicate requests? If we do not hear from you through this portal or through US Mail, we will assume that you would like us to process and bill you for both requests. (http://https/www.highlineschools.org/departments/records/public-records) \r\nAll requests are processed though this portal according to our procedures. You indicated that you do not wish to correspond with us through this portal due to the need to create a login and password. We would like to inform you that we have 2 ways of communicating with requesters, though this portal and through U.S, Mail at: Highline Public Schools 15675 Ambaum Blvd. SW, Burien, WA 98166, Attn: Public Records Officer. We will prepare all correspondence through the portal according to our procedures. All correspondence that we prepare will be automatically emailed to you. If you do not wish to log into this portal to respond to us, please send all correspondence through US Mail. \r\nThis request will be expensive and time consuming to fulfill due to the large volume of records that you requested.

Responsive documents will be produced in Adobe PDF Format and will be available to you through this portal. If you do not wish to receive the records through this portal, you may pay for the records to be loaded onto a cd. \r\nYou requested the following documents: \r\n\"December 8, 2022 \r\nThis is a follow up to a previous request: \r\nHello, \r\nSorry if for some reason the same public records request was inadvertently sent twice. This is not a \"bot\" request. Regardless, I will resubmit the request dated today 12-8-21. \r\nHighline Public Schools District \r\nWashington Public Records Act Office \r\n15675 Ambaum Blvd. SW \r\nBurien, WA 98166 \r\nvia email: publicrecordsrquest@highlineschools.org \r\nDecember 8, 2022 \r\nHIGHLINE PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021 \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records: \r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021. \r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request. \r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhighline-public-schools-district-29082%252Fhighline-public-schools-district-2021-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-the-district-responses-for-the-year-2021-137279%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecordsrequest%252540highlineschools.org&url_auth_token=AAEh8PlgY5XbjNfC97GhukhAOHg%3A1p0qlA%3AH2hJnmaE4eGc1tD_9zUsP0HpEuziWHbM0lumVvLyDow \r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nCVXKBXMV \r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 137279-25427516@requests.muckrock.com \r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 137279 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Explain in detail with full legal justification your calculation of $139.00 for fees for this public records request. \r\n\r\nI cannot find any reference to a fee schedule for electronic public records anywhere in your HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY https://www.highlineschools.org/about/board-policies/series-4000. I also cannot find any HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY statement declaring the reason your agency does not calculate actual costs.\r\n\r\nPlease send me a copy of or provide a link to the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY declaring the reason your agency does not calculate actual costs of producing electronic public records in accordance with the legally required statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs - RCW 42.56.070. As you know, any statement of costs and/or any fee schedule adopted by your agency must of course be publicly published. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(a).\r\n\r\nFurther, a statement of costs may be adopted by your agency only after providing notice and public hearing RCW 42.56.070 (7). Of course, your agency may not be required to calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if it has published rules or regulations declaring the reasons for doing so would be unduly burdensome. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a copy of the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY documents establishing actual costs or in the alternative, the public policy documents declaring that the reason for not calculating actual costs is because it would be unduly burdensome for your agency. I also need a copy of your publicly posted alternative fee schedule previously established as public policy by your agency.\r\n\r\nNote I am requesting HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY records establishing fees. I do note that a fee schedule is posted on your website, however this website fee schedule is not adopted public policy.\r\n\r\nPlease provide HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding public records fees and the reason these fees are not based on actual costs. \r\n\r\nIf your agency has no HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding fees and actual costs for public records, I would suggest you waive all fees in this public records request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nNote: your agency is required to communicate via email. As the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER, your agency email address is michelle.terry@highlineschools.org. I have been communicating with you via this email address. \r\n",

We previously provided you with website links where you can find the responsive records. There are no other records to provide to you. \nThe following is what you requested: \nMarch 6, 2023 \nThis is a follow up to request number P000442-121322: \n03-06-23 \nvia email to Highline Public Schools District Public Records Officer Michelle Terry <michelle.terry@highlineschools.org> \nHello Ms. Terry, \nThank you for your preliminary cost estimate. \nI have some concerns regarding how you have calculated costs and fees in this public records request. \nYour preliminary cost estimate of $139.00 are not \"actual costs\" per statute RCW 42.56.070. Explain in detail with full legal justification your calculation of $139.00 for fees for this public \nrecords request. \nI cannot find any reference to a fee schedule for electronic public records anywhere in your HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY \nhttps://www.highlineschools.org/about/board-policies/series-4000. I also cannot find any HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY statement declaring the reason your agency \ndoes not calculate actual costs. \nPlease send me a copy of or provide a link to the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY declaring the reason your agency does not calculate actual costs of producing \nelectronic public records in accordance with the legally required statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs - RCW 42.56.070. As you know, any statement of costs \nand/or any fee schedule adopted by your agency must of course be publicly published. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(a). \nFurther, a statement of costs may be adopted by your agency only after providing notice and public hearing RCW 42.56.070 (7). Of course, your agency may not be required to calculate the \nactual costs it charges for providing public records if it has published rules or regulations declaring the reasons for doing so would be unduly burdensome. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b). \nPlease provide a copy of the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY documents establishing actual costs or in the alternative, the public policy documents declaring that the \nreason for not calculating actual costs is because it would be unduly burdensome for your agency. I also need a copy of your publicly posted alternative fee schedule previously established as \npublic policy by your agency. \nNote I am requesting HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY records establishing fees. I do note that a fee schedule is posted on your website, however this website fee schedule \nis not adopted public policy. \nPlease provide HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding public records fees and the reason these fees are not based on actual costs. \nIf your agency has no HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding fees and actual costs for public records, I would suggest you waive all fees in this public \nrecords request. \nThank you. \nNote: your agency is required to communicate via email. As the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER, your agency email address is \nmichelle.terry@highlineschools.org. I have been communicating with you via this email address. \nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhighlinepublic- \nschools-district-29082%252Fhighline-public-schools-district-2021-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-thedistrict- \nresponses-for-the-year-2021- \n137279%252F%253Femail%253Dmichelle.terry%252540highlineschools.org&url_auth_token=AAEh8PlgY5XbjNfC97GhukhAOHg%3A1pZLC8%3A3zhwUpE5JpTkqNXEgbFtEvXId8Bh- \nSG624EUMLF7_oc \nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \nCVXKBXMV \nAttachments: \n\u2022 PUBLIC_POLICY_4040_ACCESS_TO_DISTRICT_RECORDS_3-6-2023.png \nFiled via MuckRock.com \nE-mail (Preferred): 137279-25427516@requests.muckrock.com \nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \nMuckRock News \nDEPT MR 137279 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, MA 02115 \nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests. \nAlso note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable. \n--- \nOn March 6, 2023: \nSubject: [Records Center] Public Records Request :: P000442-121322 \n--- Please respond above this line --- \nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of December 13, 2022., Reference # P000442-121322.

After reviewing the public records requests for the year 2021, we estimate that there are approximately 4460 records.

The total preliminary estimated cost to you is \n$139.00. The cost of the CD and mailing has been added because you indicated that you do not wish to login to this portal to receive the responsive records. An invoice is attached with \npayment instructions.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.120, \u201cIf an agency makes a request available on a partial or installment basis, the agency may charge for each part of the request as it is provided.\u00a0 If an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d \nPlease note that RCW 42.56.070 provides in part: \n(8) This chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law..... \nLet us know if you have any questions. \nSincerely, \nMichelle Terry \nCertified Public Records Officer \nPolicy & Strategy \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Records Center (https://highlineschool.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=486&coid=)\n",

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Copies of any and all electronic communication between Doug Matheney and representatives of:\r\nOhio House of Representatives: @ohiohouse.gov\r\nMurray Energy: @coalsource.com\r\nFirstEnergy: @FirstEnergyCorp.com\r\nAmerican Electric Power: @aep.com\r\nDuke Energy: @duke-energy.com\r\nDayton Power & Light: @aes.com \r\n\r\nPlease exclude press clips. The timeframe of this search is limited to January 20, 2017 through the processing date of the request.\r\n\r\nThe search for records should include emails along with attachments (both sent and received).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. It is in the public's interest to know DOE's role in setting energy policy. Doug Matheney recently presented on DOE energy policy priorities in Ohio at a House Public Utilities committee meeting. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. However, I am requesting a fee waiver. The organization I work for, the Energy and Policy Institute, is a clearinghouse of information and can qualify as a representative of the news media. There are several examples of public record requests that have been provided to my organization and that were then published on our website to inform journalists publishing articles. Also, I have accounts with news outlets including Huffington Post and Republic Report. Past publications on these outlets as proof are available here (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/matt-kasper) and (https://www.republicreport.org/author/matthew/). Additionally, the Department of Energy has previously categorized FOIAs from the Energy and Policy Institute under Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1004.9(b)(3) as a \"news media\" requester and have determined that I satisfy the criteria considered for a waiver of fees.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatt Kasper\r\nEnergy and Policy Institute\r\nPO Box 577764 \r\nChicago, IL. 60657",

You requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopies of Doug Matheney's, special adviser in the Office of Fossil Energy, calendar from January 20, 2017 through the processing date of the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopies of any and all electronic communication between Doug Matheney and representatives of:\r\n\r\nOhio House of Representatives: @ohiohouse.gov\r\n\r\nMurray Energy: @coalsource.com\r\n\r\nFirstEnergy: @FirstEnergyCorp.com\r\n\r\nAmerican Electric Power: @aep.com\r\n\r\nDuke Energy: @duke-energy.com\r\n\r\nDayton Power & Light: @aes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease exclude press clips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prior analyst conducted a search and pulled all of the documents responsive to the 2nd part of this request. I have those documents ready to go.  However, I noticed that they did not pull documents for Mr. Matheney's schedule, the 1st part of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interest of providing documents to you as expeditiously as possible, I'd like to ask you to waive receiving part 1 of your request for the schedule.  Schedules take a lengthy amount of time to process, and I'd essentially be starting from scratch. It will significantly delay the release of documents.   If you choose to waive the schedule, you can always file a new request for it and I'd be happy to process them at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are willing to waive the schedule at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please respond to this email to confirm your continued interest in this request.  If I do not hear back from you by Friday, September 28, 2018, I will assume you are no longer interested in this matter and close this request.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKyle Kemper, Esq.\r\n\r\nFOIA Analyst\r\n\r\nCentral Research, Inc. Contractor\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Energy\r\n\r\n1000 Independence Avenue, SW\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C. 20585\r\n\r\n(202) 586-2708",

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\nOur School District wishes to acknowledge receipt of your recent request for copies of public records, received on Friday, November 5, 2021.\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish to have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.  But, the second segment of your  request is not clear to us.  So, we are in need of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to receive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to our School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to January 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those records for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests would have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via email.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file location, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical file location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have been received by the person designated as our public records officer at the time the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably been received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate all such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That is because we cannot be required to read every single email received by every employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to locate for you those had content qualifying them as public records request.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would be to employ electronic \"keyword\" searches, of our \"inbound\" email databases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well be unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case that some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public disclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words or phrasing - such as \"public record\" - when submitting their requests.  In fact, our state's public disclosure law provides that in order for a public agency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under that statute, the records requestor need not submit it to a particular employee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public disclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any particular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \"keyword\" search terms that would likely yield every single records request that our District has received, via email over the last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.  However, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws suggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative collaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword search terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I'd like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please give me a call or email me to dialogue on that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records requests we've received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have received such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These largely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School District's archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of staff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records requests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response to the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of partial-batch-installments.  We are now estimating that you should expect to receive the first installment within 60 days of this email, on or before January 14, 2022.\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an advance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are allowable under our state's public disclosure law.  I will advise you if that will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 60-day period.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish us to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \"a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses\" to each of the public records requests we'll be providing you.   By \"Responses,\" that could be fairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you do or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to receive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered, copied, and provided to each given requestor, in \"Response\" to his or her request (i.e., because those records had content falling within the descriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently \"Respond\" to requestors by directing letters or email communications to them that contain no actual \"Responsive\" records, but instead communicate with the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry that arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this email is a precise example of that sort of \"Response\".)\r\n\r\nSo, we're in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a reasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do wish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to engaging in the dialogue I've initiated with you, concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable list of \"keyword\" searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public records requests you've requested, and also to receiving the clarification I requested above.\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me to your records request to our School District, and the one you received from the counterpart representative of mine at the Mead School District.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School District has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to answer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.  That\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request, to foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I offered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about which you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative communication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as yourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with your request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be located for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are presented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all responsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like initial responses from our School District and the Mead School District and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response to the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at all a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records request that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to double-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill all of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the course of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to consult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for additional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts believe that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so not only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of processing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records requestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances assurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely and -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable, non-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the district\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the very outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed receives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same best practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources outside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process and fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by happenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside resource for that assistance.\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical request, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA resource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request, it is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in communicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of your requests to both our School District and the Mead District were and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a need to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology, time frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our respective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the same outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses, toward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and indeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually identically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our districts.\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we  want to acknowledge and assure you that we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d approach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.  That could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the PRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has also been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school district, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and will be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the different sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will need to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of examples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as compared to the Mead District to the particular internal processes we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are assured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated by the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the protocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and -archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the request in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or lesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in terms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to dedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of experience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as to unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that staff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of employees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g., administrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to dedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the request, and their ability to perform that work while still performing their duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff availability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work on the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School District\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the Mead District (or for that matter, as compared to any other school district that has received your request) likely will end very shortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested, collaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my initial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing from you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the benefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture toward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best meets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360\u2013604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Cornelison,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI disagree with many of your statements in regards to the District\u2019s legal obligations for compliance with the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Evergreen Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the  PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that we have an initial installment of records available for you. As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Please note, requests for educational records containing information directly related to specific students under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), that were inadvertently made using the District's public records request email, have been designated as not responsive to your request. Of course please let me know if this is not an accurate understanding of the records you wish to receive.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a [?Folder icon]  shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (93 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment. (That amount would have been $1.15, based on the statutorily-authorized formula of $.05/per every four electronic records; 93 / 4 = 23.25; 23 x $0.05 = $1.15).\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 30 business days, measured from today's date, on or before March 1, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a [?Folder icon]  shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (56 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment.\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 35 business days, measured from today's date, on or before April 15, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Please note, a few emails in this installment were not uploading correctly. Those emails have been converted to pdfs, and the metadata has been provided via an Excel spreadsheet titled \"Muckrock Metadata - Sixth Installment\", included in the folder linked below.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected.

Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (30 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment.\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.

As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Please note, the emails in this installment were not uploading correctly. Those emails have been converted to pdfs, and the metadata has been provided via an Excel spreadsheet titled \"Muckrock Metadata - Tenth Installment\", included in the folder linked below.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (21 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment.\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request on or before January 13, 2023. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that we have another installment of records available for you. As you know, we provided previous installments at no cost due to the District's waiver or the de minimis Public Records Act (PRA) fee associated with those installments. However, as was previously explained to you, further installments would likely exceed an amount that we could consider de minimis and waive the charges. The next installment consists of 3,694 hard-copy pages. Under the PRA, pre-payment of $.10/page, or $369.40, is required to scan those records for processing and production of electronic copies to you. This amount does exceed the de minimis threshold.\r\n\r\nYou can make that $369.40 payment by mailing a check, money order, or similar form of payment made payable to \"Evergreen Public Schools,\" addressed to me as follows:\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\nAttn: Public Records Fees\r\nP.O. Box 8910\r\nVancouver, WA 98668\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may make that payment in person at our District Office, located at 13413 NE LeRoy Haagen Memorial Drive, Vancouver, WA 98684 on any non-holiday weekday. However, I suggest calling ahead to make sure the office is open to receive your payment. The best number to call is (360) 604-4049.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive payment, we will then be authorized by the PRA to scan the copies for you. The scanning process will not take long. However, those scanned copies will need to be reviewed for exempt material under the PRA and redaction of the same. This review will likely take considerable time, given the number of records. We estimate this review-redaction work will take approximately sixty days to complete once we receive the pre-payment required as outlined above.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that we are required to allow you a thirty-day time frame to make the pre-payment as outlined above, measured from the date of this email. A failure to receive such payment from a requester within that time frame permits us to consider their request abandoned and close it.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or any other aspect of the processing of your request as we work towards fulfilling it, please do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nA detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable, and I do need to briefly provide you information as to all additional records that I redacted in the course of fulfilling your request.\r\n\r\nAdditional redactions were made to some of the records included in the\"2.2020\", \"6.11.2021\", \"6.17.2021\" and \"9.2021\" folders of this installment. In that regard, at RCW 42.56.250(6) that statutory exemption-to-public disclosure protects against revealing the identities of complainants, other accusers, or witnesses as to alleged events of the sort that were investigated in the above folders, and who were identified as such in the materials compiled in the investigations. So, to the extent the identities of such persons could be determined by a reader of the originals of the attached records, then that personally-identifying content, as to those persons, was obscured from your ability to read it in the attached copies of those originals. Those redactions were made by our imposition of bright blue electronic redaction boxes (i.e., ___________), with all or part of the following phrase overwritten on each such box in black typeface: \"RCW 42.56.250(6)\".\r\n\r\nRedactions made under the exemption of that statute are, however, conditional, by the statute's terms. In that regard, each such accuser/complaint and witness has a right to elect that instead, the content that identifies him or her be revealed to you, as it exists in the originals of these records.  So, we have advised each such person of his/her right to make that election. As of fourteen days from today's date,  if and to the extent any of those persons advises me that s/he does consent to having his/her name/initials, as they appear in the records, disclosed to you, we will then re-produce these same records to you, but with reversal of the de-identifying redactions we've made for those persons, such that you would then be able to read their identities. So even though we've now provided you a copy of every record responsive to your request, we cannot formally consider your request closed for another two weeks. If we need to make the sort of supplemental re-production to you that I've described, then you will receive it at that time.\n",
