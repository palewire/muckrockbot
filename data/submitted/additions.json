Section 552(a) (4) (A) (iii). As an academic researcher, I will actively share and provide access to these records with the public and my colleagues. Release of these materials is in the public interest, and will greatly contribute to public knowledge of U.S. Navy programs and well-being of animals held in captivity.\r\n\r\nI am happy to receive any and all records in electronic format. Please note that 5 U.S.C. Section 552(a) (4) (A) (iv) (II) requires that you provide the first 100 copies to me at no charge.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSusan Maret",
