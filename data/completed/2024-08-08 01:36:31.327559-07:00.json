        "communication": "Dear U.S. Mint:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

The response from an FOIA Representative was provided stating that \u201cFOIA Exemption 3. FOIA Exemption 3 permits withholding of records specifically exempted from disclosure by another Federal statute. In this instance, 10 USC \u00a7 130e states, in part, that the Department of Defense (DOD) may exempt critical infrastructure security information where such disclosure would reveal vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would likely result in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to DOD operations, property or facilities. In a letter dated June 2, 2017, the DOD informed the FAA that DOD flight data constitutes DOD Critical Infrastructure Information (DCRIT) and is therefore exempt from disclosure in accordance with this statute\u201d signed by Virginia Boyle Vice President, System Operations Services Air Traffic Organization and emailed by Angella Martin-Osorio.\r\n\r\nSome alleged laws have been included regarding the redacted information:\r\n1.  Section 242 of Title 18 \r\n2.  Privacy Act of 1974 \r\n3.  The Posse Comitatus Act\r\n4.  The Insurrection Act of 1807 \r\n5.  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1113\r\n6.  Redacted information does not coincide with the 16 different critical infrastructures\r\n7.  Additional information about laws and regulations have been provided via the attached appeal document.",

Therefore, it is not a current practice to collect and retain Qualified Contracts. To the best of our knowledge, before this requirement in the QAP, three requests for Qualified Contracts were made, and one request was pursued by the owner. Based on CHFA\u2019s record retention policy, that document is no longer on file with CHFA.\r\n\r\nThe list you requested is not an existing document, however, attached is the recorded termination agreement of the Land Use Restrictive Agreement (LURA) of the one development that pursued a Qualified Contract.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, please reach out to Matt Lynn, CHFA\u2019s media liaison, for any further assistance.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Schumacher\r\nStaff Attorney\r\nLegal and Risk Management\r\nColorado Housing and Finance Authority\r\n1981 Blake Street\r\nDenver, CO 80202\r\nwww.chfainfo.com<http://www.chfainfo.com/>\r\n303.297.7471 direct\r\n303.297.2432 main\r\n800.877.2432 toll free\r\n\r\nfinancing the places where people live and work\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clover Park School District received your public records request on November 5, 2021. Your request seeks all public records requests received by the District from January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021, as well as a complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s responses to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests since 2010 have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question, and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.     Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2.     Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3.     Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4.     The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the district, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing the first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by February 4, 2022. I have also submitted your request to our NextRequest Program on November 5, 2021, at 3:29 pm. This will also include our 5-day response from our District.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAranka Holmes\r\n\r\nCoordinator for Public Records, WC Claims, and ADA\r\n\r\n[cid:b525986e-eb5d-4ccc-9e3e-be0e3be9d7ee]\r\n\r\nCreating Promising Futures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Services Center\r\n\r\n10903 Gravelly Lake Dr SW, Lakewood WA  98499-1341\r\n\r\n253-583-5083 \u2022  Fax 253-583-5088\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail message and all attachments, if any, may contain confidential and privileged material and are intended only for the person or entity to which the message is addressed.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records.\u00a0See\u00a034 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe District would like you to clarify whether you are seeking those requests for records which would qualify as FERPA requests, or if you are purely seeking the records produced under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records.\u00a0See\u00a034 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the second installment of records. The information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam Levin",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of the determination on FOIL request DOCCS-23-07-235. The request yielded 12 pages, which consisted of a DOCCS Directive  8700, titled \"Community Preparation Case \u2013 Assignment and Release Investigation Process.\"\r\n\r\nDOCCS cited three FOIL statute exemptions in redacting the document. Among them is Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(g): \"inter/intra agency materials which are not final agency policy or decisions, statistical or factual tabulations, external audits, or instructions to staff that affect the public.\"\r\n\r\nAs a DOCCS directive, the document is by definition a final agency policy. Thus POL \u00a787(2)(g) does not apply. Thus I request that DOCCS:\r\n\r\n(a) itemize the redactions, explaining which FOIL statute exemption applies to each, and\r\n(b) unredact all portions of the document which cite POL \u00a787(2)(g) as the justification.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. My phone number is (419) 309-6331.\r\n\r\nSicnerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",
