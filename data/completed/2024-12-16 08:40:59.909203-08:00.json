The declarations page\r\nlists the policy number and coverage limits.  Finally, all the people\r\nlisted on the request meet the definition of who an insured is.

We have some questions about your request but do not have a phone number or email address to reach out to you.

Accordingly, the Department is extending the deadline by five (5) business days and will provide responsive documents on or before November 26,  2024, that is- as long as we hear from you before that date.\r\n\r\nI look forward to speaking with you.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPatricia Cruz Montalvo\r\nAssistant General Counsel/FOIA Officer\r\nDivision of Legal Services\r\nIllinois Department of Public Health\r\n122 South Michigan Ave., 7th Floor\r\nChicago, IL 60603\r\nDPH.FOIA@Illinois.gov",

        "communication": "Dear Cathy Sun,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request for the following: I am requesting a copy of the Illinois Department of Public Health's FOIA request log(s) for 2021 calendar year. Specifically, I seek records that include each request's file number, the date received, a brief description of the information sought, and the nature of the response (granted, denied, or partial release).\r\n\r\nRecords responsive to your request are attached. Please note that your request was partially denied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b). The Freedom of Information Act states: (1) When a request is made to inspect or copy a public record that contains information that is exempt disclosure under this Section, but also contains information that is not exempt from disclosure, the public body may elect to redact the information that is exempt. The public body shall make the remaining information available for inspection and copying. Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: ... (b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order. Private information is defined as \"unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses.\" 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5). Private information also \"includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to\r\nany person.\" Id. Furthermore, signatures have been determined to be unique identifiers, thus \"private information\" by the Public Access Counselor opinion in 2010 PAC 9838. Accordingly, dates of birth, social security numbers, tax identification numbers, home addresses, cell phone numbers, personal phone numbers, and email addresses have been redacted from the attached records.\r\n\r\nPlease note that our FOIA logs do not include information regarding the Department's response. Please note that the existence of a request does not mean the Department has jurisdiction or possession of the records being requested. For example, requestors who asked for records pertaining to physicians were referred to the Illinois Department of Financial Professional Regulation, which is the agency that actually oversees the practice of medicine-that is, physicians.\r\n\r\nYou may request a review of this partial denial by contacting the Office of the Public Access Counselor at:\r\n\r\nLeah Bartelt, Public Access Counselor\r\nOffice of the Illinois Attorney General\r\n500 South 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, IL 62701\r\npublic.access@ilag.gov<mailto:public.access@ilag.gov>\r\n877-299-3642\r\n\r\nYou also have the right to file for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court for Sangamon County or the county where you live (5 ILCS 140/11). If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this partial denial letter (5 ILCS 140/9.4(a)). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this partial denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of further assistance, you can contact me at DPH.FOIA@Illinois.gov<mailto:DPH.FOIA@Illinois.gov> or by telephone at (312) 814-3577.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatricia C. Montalvo\r\nPatricia C.

This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. \r\n\r\nThe City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000293-090824 I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to the statutory exemptions noted below: \r\n \r\n  *  Attorney-Client Privilege \u2013 Government Code sections 7927.705 and 7930.110; Evidence Code sections 952 and 954; Bus. & Prof. Code section 6068 \u2013 Records which are exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including those relating to privilege, are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Attorney Work Product \u2013 Government Code section 7927.705; Code of Civ. Proc. section 2018.030 \u2013 Writings that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Deliberative Process Privilege \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records revealing the deliberations of agency officials used to reach a decision. \r\n  *  Preliminary Drafts and Similar Materials \u2013 Government Code section 7927.500 \u2013 Any preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. \r\n  *  Personnel Records \u2013 Government Code section 7927.700 \u2013 Certain records, such as personnel, medical, or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Confidential Informants and Investigatory or Security Files  \u2013 Government Code sections 7923.600, 7922.000; Evidence Code sections 1040, 1041 \u2013 Any complaints to a local police agency or any investigatory or security files compiled by a local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes are exempt from disclosure.

Public Interest Balancing Test \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000 -- On the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk \r\ncc: Amy Cunningham, City Manager \r\nGary Bell, City Attorney \r\nMackenzie Anderson, Assistant City Attorney \r\nConor Harkins, Assistant City Attorney",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department conducted a search and is providing you with the first batch of non-exempt email communications responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \u201cpublic records\u201d includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Similarly, Sections 7927.700 and 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest. Therefore, responsive records containing personal information (i.e., addresses, cell phone numbers, and discussion of personal matters) are being provided to you with redactions or withheld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department will continue to provide you with the copies of responsive, non-exempt records on\u00a0a rolling basis. The Department estimates that it will be providing additional responsive records by October 11, 2024, and will notify you should anything change.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records in order to conduct research on a matter of public interest. I believe that these records will be helpful in understanding the activities of these individuals and their impact on the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

For example, during the identified time period, Eva Collins appears in the \u201cto\u201d and/or \u201cfrom\u201d fields of 23,943 emails. We will need to review each email to check for protected information (such as student identifiers or privileged legal communications). The same will apply to the other forms of electronic communications.\r\n\r\nI want to get you what you\u2019re looking for as quickly and efficiently as possible. Perhaps we could break this request into pieces and work on one piece at a time? If you like, we could search first for communications sent/received between these five employees and produce those records to you. We can then move through the remainder of the request in whatever order you prefer. Please let me know if this approach would be acceptable to you.\r\n\r\nI have begun identifying potentially responsive email records.

        "communication": "Hi Sarah,\r\n\r\nThanks for the detailed update - it's much appreciated. I wanted to clarify that we are looking for electronic communications that include any one (or more) of the five named individuals in the \"to\", \"cc\", or \"from\" fields, not necessarily all five at once. We get that this makes for a lot of messages, but it's what we need for our inquiry. Let's stick with the plan of tackling this in chunks and going in reverse chronological order. This seems like the most practical approach given the volume of records.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: will the search include other forms of electronic communication apart from emails? For instance, we would be interested in instant messages from Microsoft Teams if they're available.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your response and hearing about the next steps. Thanks again for your work on this.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPAC Bellevue",

We initially intended our request to be focused as follows:\r\n\r\nWe are looking for electronic communications where at least one of the named individuals is in the \"from\" field, and at least one of them is also in either the \"to\" or \"cc\" fields. Our original revision was meant to capture this \u2014 we don't need every single message where these individuals are present, but those messages where they are directly communicating with each other. This approach should narrow down the search considerably compared to any communication where these individuals are merely included.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, could you confirm if other forms of electronic communication like instant messages, specifically from Microsoft Teams, will be included in this search?\r\n\r\nThanks for bearing with us and helping clarify these details.",

I appreciate your prompt response regarding my public records request, PRR No. 22759. After reviewing the estimated cost of approximately $900.00 to scan the 6,000 records, I would like to explore the possibility of setting up a payment plan for this fee.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of my work as an investigative journalist, managing expenses is crucial, and while I'm committed to covering the costs, it would be more manageable for me to make payments over time.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide information on whether the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife offers payment plans or if we can discuss a structured payment schedule? I want to ensure that I can receive the requested records while also meeting my financial obligations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if it's possible to proceed with the scanning of the records while we work out the payment plan details, please let me know. This would allow me to start reviewing the materials as soon as possible for my investigative work.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your guidance on this matter.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJordan Lassiter",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFiles relating to or mentioning the the Apollo Affair, a 1965 incident in which a US company, Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC), in the Pittsburgh suburbs of Apollo and Parks Township, Pennsylvania was investigated for losing 200\u2013600 pounds (91\u2013272 kg) of highly enriched uranium, with suspicions that it had gone to Israel's nuclear weapons program. \r\n\r\nIn February 1976 the CIA briefed senior staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) about the matter, stating that the CIA believed the missing highly enriched uranium went to Israel. The NRC informed the White House, leading to President-elect Carter being briefed about the investigation. Carter asked for an assessment by his National Security Advisor, whose staff concluded \"The CIA case is persuasive, though not conclusive.\"\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Based on your description of the records you are seeking, we estimate completion of your request will be on or before June 9, 2016.   \r\n\r\nPlease know that this date roughly estimates how long it will take us to close requests ahead of yours in the respective track and complete work on your request. The actual date of completion might be before or after this estimate, based on the complexity of all of the requests in the simple track. We will advise you of any change in the estimated time to complete your request. In an effort to process your request promptly, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the volume of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of assessing fees in accordance with our regulations (10 CFR 9.33), we have placed your request in the following category:  News Media Representative. If applicable, you will be charged appropriate fees for: Duplication Only.  \r\n\r\nA sheet has been enclosed that explains in detail the fee charges that may be applicable. Please do not submit any payment unless we notify you to do so.\r\n- 2 -\r\n\r\nThe following person is the Government Information Specialist who has been assigned responsibility for your request:  Stephanie Blaney at 301-415-6975 or Stephanie.Blaney@nrc.gov.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions on any matters concerning your FOIA request, please feel free to contact the assigned Government Information Specialist or me at (301) 415-7169.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoger D.

Fees (above the minimum fee charge) cannot be waived for this category of requester. \r\n\r\nEducational, Non-Commercial Scientific, News Media and Privacy Act: Fees may be charged only for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an Educational or Non-Commercial Scientific Institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a Representative of the News Media; or a person requesting his/her own records that are in a Privacy Act system of records. No fee is charged for the first one hundred pages of duplication for this category of requester.\r\n\r\nNon-Excepted: For any request not described above (Non-Excepted), fees may be charged for document search and duplication. No fee is charged for the first two hours of search time or for the first one hundred pages of duplication for this category of requester.\r\n\r\n\r\nFee Schedules  \r\n\r\nFee schedules provide only for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication, or review. Review costs include only the costs for initial examination of a document to determine whether it must be disclosed and to determine whether to withhold portions that are exempt from disclosure. The fee schedule is as follows:\r\n\r\nSearch & Review \r\nConducted By\t\t       \t\tRate\r\n\r\n  ! SES/COMMISSIONER\t$90.53/hour\t(ES-maximum)\t\r\n\r\n  ! PROFESSIONAL\t$56.36/hour\t(GG-13, Step 6)\r\n\r\n  ! CLERICAL\t\t\t  $25.16/hour\t(GG-7, Step 7)\r\n\r\nDuplication Charges\t\t  $.20 per page\r\n\r\nFees for non-standard search or duplication will be charged at the actual cost (e.g. providing copying of audio tapes or conducting computer searches).\r\n\r\nMinimum Fee: No fee will be charged unless the fee is equal to or greater than $25.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen to Pay Fees\r\n\r\nIf we estimate that fees will not exceed $25.00 or you have stated in your request a higher amount that you are willing to pay, we assume your willingness to pay up to $25 or the amount stipulated and you will be billed after we have completed your request. \r\n\r\nIf we estimate that fees will exceed $25.00 or any amount that has been stated by you in your request, we will not proceed with your request until we have notified you and obtained your agreement to pay the estimated fees. \r\n\r\nIf we estimate fees will exceed $250, you will be required to pay the estimated fees in advance before we proceed further with your request. If, while processing your request, we find that the actual fees exceed the estimated fee, we will obtain your consent to pay the additional fees before continuing to process your request.  If the actual fees to process your request are less than any advance payment you have made, you will be refunded the overpayment amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFee Waivers \r\n\r\nA waiver or reduction of fees may be granted for furnishing documents if a requester, by fully addressing the eight factors in 10 CFR 9.41, clearly demonstrates that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.",

There is an Executive Summary, Appendix A (UNCLASSIFIED), and Appendix B (with Proprietary Information Removed).\r\n\r\nThese contain the following:\r\n\r\nThe Executive Summary\r\n\r\n-        Safeguards Requirements in the mid-1960s\r\n\r\n-        The AEC Philosophy of Financial Responsibility\r\n\r\n-        Physical Protection Program Deficiencies\r\n\r\n-        Material Control and Accounting Program Deficiencies\r\n\r\nAppendix A (UNCLASSIFIED)\r\n\r\n-        Discussion of the old security program that is not in place any more\r\n\r\nAppendix A (CLASSIFIED) would continue to be withheld under Ex. 1 because some of the information may still be in place at different plants.\r\n\r\nAppendix B (with Proprietary Information Removed)\r\n\r\n-        General discussion of the lack of rigor in the old safeguards program, again this is not in place any more\r\n\r\nI searched previous FOIA requests and the only other types of records I found were some decommissioning documents that are already publicly available.  We did have 2 similar requests to yours that came in back in 2011 and 2008 and both of those the NRC responded with No Records as well.  Please let me know if you\u2019d like me to provide you these responsive records.  If you are not interested in these please let me know and we can close your request.\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay, but I had to get responses from all offices.\r\n\nThank you again,\r\nStephanie Blaney\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\r\n301-415-6975",

There may be additional information in storage from the previous Chairman during that time, however if there is we are confident that likely that information is marked Classified and would still remain classified, which wouldn\u2019t be released.  If these records are located they would need to have a declassification review completed, which we are anticipating would remain classified.

You may limit this request to records created between June 18, 2020 and the date of the processing of this request. \r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

You may limit this request to records created between June 18, 2020 and the date of the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\"\r\n\r\nPlease confirm whether the information requested is still needed. If we do not hear from you by October 05, 2024, the request will be closed.\r\n\r\nIf different information is now needed.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Mr. Kevin David Mitnick. Born August 6, 1963 in Van Nuys, California. Mr. Mitnick died July 16, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. His death at age 59 was widely reported in the media in July, 2023. He was a computer hacker and social engineer who subsequently became an American political prisoner who was emblematic of the then U.S. Government's overreaction to hackers, and hacker culture.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Mr. Mitnick. Major media outlets across America as of July 20th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/kevin-mitnick-dead-hacker.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-hacker-dies/\r\n\r\nHis cause was championed by 2600 magazine (\"The Hacker Quarterly\"), and additional relevant records for Mr. Mitnick and the campaign to free him, may be found in relation to 2600 magazine.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Mr. Kevin Mitnick.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Mr. Kevin Mitnick.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Mr. Kevin Mitnick.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Mr. Mitnick including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nMr. Kevin Mitnick was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

Please provide any records that fall within the scope of this request , including but not limited to : \r\n\r\nMemos \r\nEmails \r\nLetters \r\nDirectives \r\nPolicy documents \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.535, subdivision (a), this message shall serve as a formal response to your request. This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. The City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000305-103024  I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to\u00a0 Government Code section 7922.000 - Personally Identifying Information; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. As such, we have redacted personally identifying information including home addresses, telephone numbers, license plate numbers, etc. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk cc: Amy Cunningham, City Manager \r\nGary Bell, City Attorney \r\nConor Harkins, Assistant City Attorney \r\nMackenzie Anderson, Assistant City Attorney",

This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. The City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000307-103024  I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to the statutory exemptions noted below: \r\n\r\n Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. As such, we have redacted personally identifying information including home addresses, telephone numbers, license plate numbers, etc. Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk \r\ncc:Amy Cunningham, City Manger \r\nGary Bell, City Attorney \r\nConor Harkins, Assistant City Attorney \r\nMackenzie Anderson, Assistant City Attorney",

This data should include amounts billed and collected to civilian emergency patients of services performed within the given years. Please provide this data as a CSV file.

Box 15616\r\nWilmington, DE 19850\r\n\r\n3) Contracts between the Department of Treasury and any other Private Collections Agencies (PCA) between 2016 and 2021. \r\n\r\n4)  PCA compliance reviews between 2016 and 2024.\r\n\r\n5) Formal findings memo regarding PCAs compliance alongside responses by PCAs to each finding with corrective actions, if any.\r\n\r\n6) Complaints made to PCAs or the  Cross-Servicing call center that mention or refer to medical debt between 2016 and 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tInstructions Regarding \u201cLeads:\u201d \u2013 As required by the relevant case law, Department of Treasury , show follow any leads it discovers during the conduct of its searches and performs additional searches when said leads indicate that records may be located in another system. Failure to follow clear leads is a violation of FOIA\r\n2.\tRequest for Public Records \u2013 Please search for any records even if they are already publicly available. \r\n3.\tRequests for Electronic and Paper/Manual Searches - I request that searches of all electronic and paper/manual incidences, filing systems, and locations for any and all records relating or referring to the subject of my request be conducted. \r\n4.\tRequest for Search of Filing Systems, Indices, and Locations \u2013 I request that Department of Treasury . Search all of its offices and components which are likely to contain responsive records\r\n5.\tRequests regarding photographs and other visual materials \u2013 I request that any photographs or other visual materials responsive to my request be released to me in their original or comparable forms, quality, and resolution. For example, if a photograph was taken digitally, or if Department of Treasury , maintains a photograph digitally, I request disclosure of the original digital image file, not a reduced resolution version of that image nor a printout and scan of that image file. Likewise, if a photograph was originally taken as a color photograph, I request disclosure of that photograph as a color image, not a black and white image. Please contact me for any clarification on this point. \r\n6.\tRequest for Duplicate Pages \u2013 I request disclosure of any and all supposedly \u201cduplicate\u201d pages. Scholars analyze records not only for the information available on any given page, but also for the relationship between that information and information on pages surrounding it. As such, though certain pages may have been previously released to me, the existence of those pages within new context renders them functionally new pages. As such, the only way to properly analyze released information is to analyze that information with its proper context. Therefore, I request disclosure of all \u201cduplicate\u201d pages. \r\n7.\tRequest to Search Emails \u2013 Please search for emails relating to the subject matter of my request.\r\n8.\tRequest for Search of Records Transferred to Other Agencies \u2013 I request that in conducting its search, Department of Treasury , disclose releasable records even if they are available publicly through other sources outside of the organization. \r\n9.\tRegarding Destroyed Records \u2013 If any records responsive or potentially responsive to my request have been destroyed, my request includes but is not limited to any and all records relating or referring to the destruction of those records. This includes, but is not limited to, any and all records relating or referring to the events leading to the destruction of those records. \r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SCOPE AND BREADTH OF REQUESTS\r\n\r\nPlease interpret the scope of this request broadly. Department of Treasury  is instructed to interpret the scope of this request in the most liberal manner possible short of any interpretation that would lend to a conclusion that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTIONS AND SEGREBALITY\r\n\r\nI call your attention to President Obama\u2019s 21 January 2009 Memorandum concerning the Freedom of Information Act in which he states:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA\u2026The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA. \r\n\r\nIn the same Memorandum, President Obama added that government information should not be kept confidential \u201cmerely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because of errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, President Obama ordered that \u201cThe Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the case of doubt, openness prevails\u201d\r\n\r\nNonetheless, if any responsive record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt from production, FOIA statues provide that even if some of the requested material is properly exempt from mandatory disclosure, all segregable portions must be released. If documents are denied in part or in whole, please specify which exemption(s) is (are) claimed for each passage or whole document denied. Please provide a complete itemized inventory and a detailed factual justification of total or partial denial of documents. Specify the number of pages in each document and the toal number of pages pertaining to this request. For \u201cclassified\u201d material denied, please include the following information: the classification (confidential., secret or top secret); identity of the classifier; date or event for automatic declassification or classification review or downgrading; if applicable, identity of official authorizing extension of automatic declassification or review past six years; and, if applicable, the reason for extended classification beyond six years.\r\n\r\nIn excising material, please \u201cblack out\u201d the material rather than \u201cWhite out\u201d or \u201ccut out.\u201d I expect, as provided by FOIA, that the remaining non-exempt portions of documents will be released. Please release all pages regardless of the extent of excising, even if all that remains are stationary headings or administrative markings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholdings serve no important public interest. \r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING REQUEST\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records with administrative markings and pagination included. Please send a memo (copy to me) to the appropriate units in your office to assure that no record related to this requests are destroyed. Please advise of any destruction of records and include the data of the authority of such destruction. \r\n\r\nFORMAT \r\n\r\nI request that any release stemming from this request be provided to me in digital format (soft copy) via email, or via USB DRIVE, COMPACT DISK, or other like media. \r\n\r\nFEE CATEGORY AND REQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI am an investigative journalist who has written for major media including Business Insider, Time, Fortune, and The Nation Magazine. I am willing to pay any reasonable expenses associated with this request, however, as the purpose of the request is disclosure in full conformity with the statutory requirements for a waiver of fees, I formally request such a waiver. I request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \r\n\r\nShould my request for a fee waiver be denied, I request that I be categorized as a member of the news media for free purposes. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTekendra Parmar",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\u2022\tA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\u2022\tA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is for the calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, up to and including the day the records are produced. The scope of the request is the Mel H.

All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\u2022 A referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is for the calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, up to and including the day the records are produced. The scope of the request is the Mel H. King Academy South End Academy, formerly known as the McKinley schools, including all records for the following schools: \r\n\u2022 Elementary: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116. \r\n\u2022 K-12 Academy: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116. \r\n\u2022 Middle: 50 St. Mary\u2019s Street, Boston, MA 02215. \r\n\u2022 Prep: 97 Peterborough Street, Boston, MA 02115. \r\nThroughout this request, \u201cSchool\u201d refers to all of the schools described above. \u201cSchool-related arrest\u201d refers to \u201can arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nFor the School and time period described above, I request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement. \r\n2. Specifically, I request a database extract including the following variables: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) including the statute governing the alleged offense \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n3. If a database extract as described in bullets 1\u20132 is not possible, please provide any existing police reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement. \r\n4. The total number and a brief description of 911 calls from the School that were received by your department. \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). Moreover, for municipalities with a population of over 20,000, the first two hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record may not be charged a fee. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M.G.L. c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at averyfarmer@cfjj.org.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

I have attached a copy of the previous data pull with duplicate entries removed via the Excel \u201cremove duplicates\u201d tool.\r\nThank you for your patience and understanding.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPete\n",
