Electronic communications (FD-1057 forms)\r\n2. Incident data and summaries\r\n3. Investigation narratives and interview synopses (FD-302 forms)\r\n4. Collected item and evidence entry logs (FD-1087 forms)\r\n5. Tips, leads, investigative reports, and documents shared with the FBI by other law enforcement agencies and individuals (FD-1036, titled \u201cImport Forms\u201d)\r\n6. Laboratory examination requests (FD-1121 forms)\r\n7. Search warrant affidavits and applications\r\n8. Signed search warrants\r\n9. Search warrant execution logs\r\n10. Property receipts (FD-597 forms)\r\n11. Evidence collected item logs (FD-886 forms)\r\n12. Photographic logs (FD-674 forms)\r\n13. Presumptive test logs\r\n\r\nAbby and Libby were found murdered near the Monon High Bridge in Delphi, Carroll County, Indiana, on February 14, 2017. On November 11, 2024, Richard Allen was convicted of these murders and sentenced to 130 years in prison. \r\n\r\nRelevant media releases can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_mTpaRs-0n_oNGGezgkxsY6WD5WeRSvg\r\n\r\nCourt documents regarding the State of Indiana\u2019s case against Richard M. Allen can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/111qXoXAw9YJ_8b3KV0EsEIeiYmOHeuH1\r\n\r\nPlease note that Ronald E. Logan, who was investigated as a person of interest in 2017, passed away on January 24, 2022. As such, he no longer has personal privacy interests protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. See attached document titled \u201c20220302_Ron_Logan_Public_Notice.pdf\u201d for proof of death.\r\n\r\nI would also like to request expedited processing of this request. The FBI may grant expedited processing when the request concerns a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest, which may raise questions about the government's integrity and affect public confidence (see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(iii), (iv) (2014)). \r\n\r\nFor a significant portion of the interested public, the investigation and subsequent conviction of Richard Allen did not instill confidence. The government\u2019s integrity is at stake. To increase transparency and restore public confidence, I intend to disseminate the requested records to a large audience in their original form, without restriction. \r\n\r\nIf previously released records are available, I request a rolling release of those records while additional records are located and processed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarl McGehee",
