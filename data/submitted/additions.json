Please refer this request to all of the DOJ components likely to have responsive records.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 2025, Bloomberg reported that \"Apple Inc ... on Saturday [April 5, 2025] received a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi telling the company it should follow President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that will extend the pause on a TikTok ban in the US, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\" Please refer to the attachment for an excerpt of the article, which is published at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-06/apple-keeps-tiktok-on-its-store-after-assurances-from-ag-bondi/.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. The April 2025 letter about TikTok from DOJ to Apple Inc, described above.\r\n2. Any similar April 2025 letters about TikTok from DOJ to Alphabet Inc. or its subsidiary Google LLC.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay fees for this request up to a maximum of $200. If you estimate that the fees will exceed this limit, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnthony Tan",
