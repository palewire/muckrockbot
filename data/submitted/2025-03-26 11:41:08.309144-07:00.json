        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRegarding an interaction with Mark Lighthipe on 11/07/2016 at around 09:38:\r\n- All incident, dispatch log entries and arrest reports. Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions: If this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific  exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",

Property receipts (FD-597 forms)\r\n11. Evidence collected item logs (FD-886 forms)\r\n12. Photographic logs (FD-674 forms)\r\n13. Presumptive test logs\r\n\r\nAbby and Libby were found murdered near the Monon High Bridge in Delphi, Carroll County, Indiana, on February 14, 2017. On November 11, 2024, Richard Allen was convicted of these murders and sentenced to 130 years in prison. \r\n\r\nRelevant media releases can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_mTpaRs-0n_oNGGezgkxsY6WD5WeRSvg\r\n\r\nCourt documents regarding the State of Indiana\u2019s case against Richard M. Allen can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/111qXoXAw9YJ_8b3KV0EsEIeiYmOHeuH1\r\n\r\nPlease note that Ronald E. Logan, who was investigated as a person of interest in 2017, passed away on January 24, 2022. As such, he no longer has personal privacy interests protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. See attached document titled \u201c20220302_Ron_Logan_Public_Notice.pdf\u201d for proof of death.\r\n\r\nI would also like to request expedited processing of this request. The FBI may grant expedited processing when the request concerns a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest, which may raise questions about the government's integrity and affect public confidence (see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(iii), (iv) (2014)). \r\n\r\nFor a significant portion of the interested public, the investigation and subsequent conviction of Richard Allen did not instill confidence. The government\u2019s integrity is at stake. To increase transparency and restore public confidence, I intend to disseminate the requested records to a large audience in their original form, without restriction. \r\n\r\nIf previously released records are available, I request a rolling release of those records while additional records are located and processed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A summary was provided in  a 1971 Domestic Intelligence Division inspection report: \u201cBANPOP is the code name for a program initiated in August, 1966, in an attempt to identify illegals in the U. S. who may be receiving funds through Swiss banks. The basis for the program was an analysis of four Soviet illegal cases between 1955 and 1966 in which the Banque Populaire Swisse of Switzerland was used by the Soviets to fund illegals. The transfers are screened with the following criteria: (1) the person or individual beneficiary is named; (2) the amount of the transfer is between $300 and $5000 and (3) the last name of the person ordering and receiving is the same of of the money and is directed to a specific bank account.\u201d (https://archive.org/details/FBI-Church-Committee-File/62-116395-441-475/page/4/mode/2up, https://archive.org/details/FBI-Church-Committee-File/62-116395-586-Bulky2/page/126/mode/2up) This is to include file 65-HQ-70741 and any associated bulky files, sub-files, and enclosures behind file.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

Doe 1-26 vs. Musk (https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293.77.2.pdf), Jeremy Lewin stated that he has been employed at USAID since 1/28/2025 as a Senior Advisor. He also declares he has never worked for Elon Musk or the USDS. Jeremy Lewin was also among the initial team of DOGE staffers that arrived at the CFPB on or around 2/6/2025. He was also identified as being on the staff list at the National Institute of Health along with other identified DOGE staffer in an article published in Wired on 2/24/2025. I would like to request the following information where possible:\r\n\r\nFor USAID:\r\n1. Any confirmation that Jeremy Lewin was formally hired at USAID on or before 1/28/2025\r\n2. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the USAID from another agency, any relevant details on that arrangement that you can share, including a memorandum of understanding (or similar document) outlining his duties and responsibilities of each partner, as well as emails between the USAID and the other agency about the arrangement. I would expect this to be on our around Feb 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor the CFPB and possibly USAID:\r\n3. If Jeremy Lewin was hired by the CFPB, any details you can share on that appointment, including if he signed the relevant onboarding paperwork as a new hire at the agency. I would expect this to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n4. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the CFPB from another agency, any relevant details that can be shared on the memorandum of understanding (or similar documents) outlining his role and the responsibilities of each partner in this arrangement, as well as emails about the detailing arrangements where available in either USAID/State or the CFPB. I would expect these communication to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor NIH and possibly USAID/CFPB:\r\n5. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the National Institute of Health from the USAID or CFPB, I would like to request the corresponding memorandum of understanding or other relevant documents about that arrangement, as well as any relevant email communications you can provide from any other agency to the National Institutes of Health about that arrangement. I do not have a precise date for this, but I would expect it to be in February 2025 before 2/24/2025\r\n\r\nFor US Doge Service:\r\n1. If you have any records that show that Jeremy Lewin was hired as an employee of USDS at any time in January or February 2025, I would appreciate that.\r\n2. Any communications between the USDS and other agencies (USAID/Department of State) coordinating the detailing of Jeremy Lewin to agencies like the CFPB alongside other staff employed by USDS\r\n\r\nI understand that you might not be able to provide me some agency-internal personnel records under FOIA exemptions 2 and 6, but I think it is in the public interest to understand the coordination among these agencies, and I would hope you would be able to provide me whatever relevant details can help provide more insight on what was being done in these partnerships. Please reach out if you need any clarification or want to give me feedback on my requests. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
