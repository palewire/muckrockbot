A copy of all agreements, contracts, performance work statements, requests for proposal, and clarifications between ICE and CoreCivic allowing the company to reopen and operate what is now known as the California City Immigration Processing Center in California City California. Some or all of these arrangements may fall within Contract ID 70CDCR25D00000010 and/or\r\n70CDCR25FR0000039. \r\n\r\n2. A copy of all written communications between ICE and CoreCivic pertaining to the records listed in Item 1 above for the period beginning March 1, 2024, and continuing through the date the agency tasks an adequate search responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of all facility inspections ICE or any entity acting on ICE's behalf performed of the California City Immigrant Processing Center to ascertain the condition of the facility and whether it comports with federal standards, as well as any working papers created as part of these inspections and any communications between ICE and CoreCivic or any entity acting on ICE's behalf and CoreCivic pertaining to these inspections. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of all invoices CoreCivic sent to ICE for pertaining to the contracts described in Item 1 above. \r\n\r\n5. A copy of the ICE-approved facility handbook for the California City Immigrant Processing Center. \r\n\r\n6. Any communications between ICE and California City officials regarding its plan to reopen the Cal City prison during the period beginning December 1, 2024, and continuing through the date the agency tasks an adequate search responsive to this request. \r\n\r\n7. Any communications or agreements between ICE and the US Marshals regarding collaboration, coordination, or assistance between the Marshals and ICE in helping CoreCivic reopen the Cal City Prison. \r\n\r\nAn adequate search responsive to this request will task, at minimum, the ICE Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ), ICE Office of Detention Oversight (ODO), ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, and ICE's Office of the Acting Director. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements in support of this request are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination. My edited work has appeared in The Intercept, The Appeal, and the Atlanta Community Press Collective. \r\n2. There is an urgent need to inform the public of the contractual and oversight decisions ICE and CoreCivic have reached regarding the Cal City prison facility. \r\n3. At present, contrary to its existing practice and obligations under federal appropriations requirements and the affirmative disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), ICE has not posted a copy of its contract with CoreCivic for the operation of the Cal City prison facility. See www.ice.gov/FOIA/library (generating no results for contracts pertaining to Cal City). \r\n4. At present, contrary to its existing practice and obligations under federal appropriations requirements and the affirmative disclosure provisions of FOIA, ICE has not posted a copy of any inspection it conducted for the Cal City prison. \r\n5. At present, contrary to its existing practice and obligations under federal appropriations requirements and the affirmative disclosure provisions of FOIA, ICE has not listed any detention statistics for the Cal City prison in its August 29, 2025, Detention Statistics disclosure, despite confirmed reports that ICE transferred noncitizens to the facility up to a week prior to releasing those figures. \r\n6. The Cal City prison is currently operating without a valid business license. \r\n7. The Cal City prison failed the pre-licensing fire inspection, and was deemed to dangerous to safely conduct business. \r\n8. The Cal City prison is currently operating without a valid Conditional Use Permit. \r\n9. The Cal City prison is currently operating in contravention of SB29, a California statute, CoreCivic and ICE challenged and lost the fight to strike down at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Consequently, ICE and CoreCivic are violating the mandate in that case by operating Cal City in contravention of SB29. \r\n10. Conditions inside the Cal City prison are unconstitutionally punitive, according to reports from noncitizens currently housed there, in violation of the Ninth Circuit's King v. Los Angeles County. Detained immigrants transferred to the facility from other sites of ICE detention report being subjected to prison-like conditions of confinement, punitive searches, denial of medication, and lack of access to basic, legally required services, such as a law library and outdoor recreation. \r\n11. The location of the Cal City prison makes it particularly risky to transfer noncitizens there for detention who share certain genetic phenotypes because of their susceptibility and lack of immunity to Valley Fever, placing medically vulnerable detained immigrants at heightened risk for serious harm, and imposing serious strains on the local health and emergency response system. \r\n12. The Cal City prison was a site of multiple preventable deaths during CoreCivic's prior operation pursuant contracts with the California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, including multiple drug overdoses, and prior to that, when the facility was being used by the Marshals and ICE, at least three apparent deaths in custody by people held there on ICE detainers.\r\n13. The secrecy with which ICE and CoreCivic carried out the reopening of the facility has left immigrants and their advocates and attorneys unable to effectively ensure access to counsel and their loved ones. For instance, during a recent California City Planning Commission meeting on September 2, a young child named Monica called in to beg for information about her father's whereabouts. A mother, speaking through an interpreter, related how her son's transfer to the Cal City facility substantially interfered with her ability to assist him in preparing his defense before immigration court. \r\n14. CoreCivic has an exceptionally dangerous, deadly, and abusive track record in its performance of ICE detention services under contracts with ICE. Since ICE began publishing data on deaths in custody, CoreCivic-run facilities have seen more deaths, more findings of preventable death, and more repeat findings of violations, than other contractors. CoreCivic-run facilities top the list of deadliest detention sites in the ICE system, despite having no greater population than comparable facilities operated by the company's competitors. \r\n15. CoreCivic is subject to a nationwide, certified, forced labor class action in the Southern District of California that survived Supreme Court review and is proceeding toward summary judgment. It is unlawful for ICE to enter into contracts with firms that engage in forced labor.\r\n16. There has been exceptional and widespread media interest in the reopening of the Cal City prison, and, based on the violations of law, standards, and policy listed above, there exists significant doubt as to the legality of the government's actions in awarding this contract under current circumstances.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted to clarify whether the Committee on Open Government (COOG) maintains any internal policies or records regarding the forwarding of credible evidence of willful concealment or destruction of public records (as described in Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(8) and Penal Law \u00a7 240.65) to enforcement authorities such as the State Inspector General, county district attorneys, the State Comptroller\u2019s Investigations Division, or the Attorney General\u2019s Public Integrity Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe Committee has stated that it lacks \u201cenforcement\u201d or \u201creferral\u201d authority. This request does not dispute that point. Instead, it seeks to determine whether COOG has adopted any policy\u2014formal or informal\u2014concerning whether staff may transmit neutral, fact-only complaints or notices when they encounter such conduct in FOIL appeals and determinations that agencies are required by law to forward to COOG (\u00a7 89(4)(a)).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this request is to ensure transparency: either to confirm that no such policy exists (meaning COOG has discretion but chooses not to act), or to identify any written guidance that explains why complaint-forwarding is prohibited. In either case, the public has an interest in understanding how systemic FOIL violations are handled when they rise to the level of potential criminal conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords sought (Jan. 1, 2020\u2013present):\r\n\r\nA. Any written policy, SOP, memo, training slide, or email guidance adopted or used by COOG that addresses whether COOG staff may (or may not) transmit complaints, notices, or factual summaries to\r\n\r\n(i) the State Inspector General\r\n(ii) county district attorneys\r\n(iii) the Office of the State Comptroller Investigations\r\n or (iv) the Attorney General Public Integrity Bureau\r\n\r\nconcerning potential willful concealment or destruction of FOIL\u2011responsive records.\r\n\r\nB. Any records reflecting instances in which COOG transmitted (or declined to transmit) such complaints/notices to any of the authorities in A.\r\n\r\nC. Any legal analysis produced for or held by COOG that interprets FOIL \u00a7\u00a7 89(1)(b), 89(2)(a), 89(4)(a) and/or Penal Law \u00a7 240.65 in relation to COOG\u2019s ability to forward factual materials to enforcement authorities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nInformation on New York City's Domestic Worker Mediation Program, including answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. How does the program define \"domestic workers\"?\r\n2. The DCWP website states: \"If you are a paid care worker in NYC, you have a dedicated City resource for workplace questions and complaints: the Paid Care Division within the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) Office of Labor Policy & Standards.\" Then the website goes on to define paid care workers as including both homecare and domestic workers. Does this mean that homecare workers cannot seek dispute resolution under the program?\r\n3. Why did Mayor Adams choose to launch this program?\r\n4. If homecare workers cannot seek mediation under the program, is there another way for them to receive support from the DCWP?\r\n5. How do domestic workers access the program? Is there a way to file a specific request for mediation? Or does the DCWP or another department identify potential cases in need of mediation from a general intake form for workers' complaints?\r\n6. Can you confirm the date that the program went live? Was it December 6, 2022 (the publication date of this press release from Mayor Eric Adams' office)?\r\n7. How many complaints has the program received from the time of launch until today? Can you share both the total and an annual breakdown?\r\n8. What percent and gross number of complaints were filed by homecare workers, such as home health aides, personal care aides, and home attendants? Can you share the breakdown of complaints by category of occupation?\r\n9. What percent of complaints are filed by women?\r\n10. What percent of complaints are filed by immigrants?\r\n11. What is the average age of the complainants?\r\n12. Were there any cases filed by employers? Or does the program take cases that are filed by workers?\r\n13. What percent and gross number of complaints filed were about wage theft? Can you share a breakdown of complaints by complaint type?\r\n14. What are the types of outcomes that can result from a case submitted for mediation under the program?\r\n15. What does \"resolution\" mean under the program? \r\n16. Does \"resolution\" include wage recovery in wage theft cases? If so, what percent and gross amount of owed wages were returned to the workers on average?\r\n17. Can you provide an end-to-end overview of the steps in the process, from intake to outcome?\r\n18. Of the total number of complaints filed from launch until today, how many have been selected for mediation under the program?\r\n19. Of the total number of complaints selected for mediation from launch until today, how many were resolved?\r\n20. Are workers who seek resolution through the program still able to pursue litigation? Or does participation in the program prevent them from doing so?\r\n21. How is DCWP or other offices (the Mayor's office, OATH) spreading awareness of the program, if at all?\r\n22. What is the budget for the program?\r\n23. Is DCWP aware of any cases of employer retaliation against workers who seek support from the program?\r\n24. Are there any other programs by the state or city that provide similar or overlapping services?\r\n\r\nWhere possible, I'd appreciate any spreadsheets you can provide for analysis as well.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nReva Abrol",

Folkston is now the largest ICE detention facility in Georgia. \r\n2. Following the preventable death of Jaspal Singh in 2023, ICE rewarded Folkston's operator, GEO, with an expansion of the Folkston contract worth over $100M\r\n3. In 2025, Folkston was the site of a second in-custody death. \r\n4. Logs of 911 calls reflect instances in which EMS units were unavailable to gain timely access to the facility as a result of GEO staff's inability to consistently man the sally ports and entryways to secure areas, delaying emergency care for people inside. \r\n5. Lack of access to timely emergency medical care threatens the health safety of people in Folkston and the surrounding community. \r\n6. ICE Mortality Reviewers have attributed lack of timely access to emergency medical care to a significant number of deaths in ICE custody. \r\n7. The records requested will shed light on whether, and to what extent, ICE is aware of the challenges posed and consequences created by its use of detention in high numbers at the Folkston facility. \r\n8. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination through edited publications, and have previously been granted expedited processing by federal FOIA offices on this basis. \r\n9. These records are needed on an expedited basis to fill out the federal side of a piece for which I have received journalism grant funding and which will be published no later than October.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

She is the wife of Michael Sullivan. Meaghan was employed by the MARDI GRAS Strip club as a bartender. She has engaged in misuse of a computer and fraud and stalking after I got into a verbal argument with Michael who was at the strip club and heard her say to him after she would take care of it. After this incident, my emails begun to get hacked and I was harassed for over 15 years. I am asking for her personnel file and a in-dept look on the woman. It is believed she was involved in serious criminal behaviors including skimming from the mardi gras bar in springfield and grooming young women or recruiting them to dance. I reported this to the D.O.J but expect you release the personnel file as I am looking to sue.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please redact in full the \u201cLicense Plate\u201d column, I am not requesting that data. The agency may redact or omit that column in its entirety. The remaining fields requested such as Name, Org Name, Reason, and Search Time consist solely of administrative metadata documenting system use. \r\n\r\nClarifications Regarding Scope and Burden\r\n\r\nNot burdensome: \r\nThis request is narrowly tailored. It does not seek every audit entry, only those containing the short list of immigration-related keywords. While there may be many more terms and variations used for immigration searches, we are keeping this list short and explicit to avoid a burdensome request. The requested records are produced automatically by the Flock Safety system in spreadsheet form. Filtering the \u201cReason\u201d column for a limited set of keywords is a routine data filtering operation. \r\n\r\nNot categorical: \r\nThis request is narrowly tailored. It seeks only those audit entries where the \u201cReason\u201d field contains any of the specific immigration-related terms provided in the short list above. It does not encompass all audit records or broad categories of data.\r\n\r\nNot exempt under \u00a7 2-130: \r\nAudit logs are administrative records documenting system use,  such as the identity of the user, the time of access, and the stated reason for the search. With the exception of the \u201cLicense Plate\u201d column (which can be omitted), these logs do not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cALPR information\u201d under 625 ILCS 5/2-130. They are oversight metadata, not raw surveillance outputs.\r\n\r\nCompelling public interest:\r\nThe Illinois TRUST Act (5 ILCS 805) and the Way Forward Act (Public Act 102-0234) explicitly prohibit local law enforcement from engaging in federal civil immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\n625 ILCS 5/2-130 restricts the use of ALPR systems for immigration enforcement and limits secrecy around ALPR oversight.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Secretary of State has launched a statewide investigation into ALPRs, including how they are used for immigration criminalization*. This underscores the importance of these public audit records and the clear public interest in disclosing the requested records.\r\n\r\nSome recent public reporting on local ALPRs includes:\r\n\r\nICE Taps into Nationwide AI-Enabled Camera Network, Data Shows\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20250527141200/https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/>\r\n\r\nDEA agent used Illinois cop\u2019s Flock license plate reader password for immigration enforcement searches\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20250811191507/https://unraveledpress.com/a-dea-agent-used-an-illinois-police-officers-flock-license-plate-reader-password-for-unauthorized-immigration-enforcement-searches/>\r\n\r\nFeds Used Local Cop's Password to Do Immigration Surveillance With Flock Cameras\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20250812151424/https://www.404media.co/feds-used-local-cops-password-to-do-immigration-surveillance-with-flock-cameras/>\r\n\r\nCBP Had Access to More than 80,000 Flock AI Cameras Nationwide\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20250902190711/https://www.404media.co/cbp-had-access-to-more-than-80-000-flock-ai-cameras-nationwide/>\r\n\r\nFlock Safety license plate camera company stops cooperating with federal agencies over investigation concerns\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20250902193429/https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/flock-safety-license-plate-company-federal-agencies-cooperation/>\r\n\r\nFinally, it is important to note that the very data being withheld from the public is already uploaded in full to a private data broker, where it is stored in proprietary off-site systems and made available to Flock Safety system users. This practice constitutes an enclosure of public data collected without the consent of those targeted by municipal surveillance weapons. The public interest is evident and the request is clearly within the scope of FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It does not seek every audit entry, only those containing the short list of immigration-related keywords. While there may be many more terms and variations used for immigration searches, we are keeping this list short and explicit to avoid a burdensome request. The requested records are produced automatically by the Flock Safety system in spreadsheet form. Filtering the \u201cReason\u201d column for a limited set of keywords is a routine data filtering operation. \r\n\r\nNot categorical: \r\nThis request is narrowly tailored. It seeks only those audit entries where the \u201cReason\u201d field contains any of the specific immigration-related terms provided in the short list above. It does not encompass all audit records or broad categories of data. \r\n\r\nNot exempt under \u00a7 2-130: \r\nAudit logs are administrative records documenting system use, such as the identity of the user, the time of access, and the stated reason for the search. With the exception of the \u201cLicense Plate\u201d column (which can be omitted), these logs do not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cALPR information\u201d under 625 ILCS 5/2-130. They are oversight metadata, not raw surveillance outputs. \r\n\r\nCompelling public interest: \r\nThe Illinois TRUST Act (5 ILCS 805) and the Way Forward Act (Public Act 102-0234) explicitly prohibit local law enforcement from engaging in federal civil immigration enforcement. \r\n\r\n625 ILCS 5/2-130 restricts the use of ALPR systems for immigration enforcement and limits secrecy around ALPR oversight. \r\n\r\nThe Illinois Secretary of State has launched a statewide investigation into ALPRs, including how they are used for immigration criminalization*. This underscores the importance of these public audit records and the clear public interest in disclosing the requested records. \r\n\r\nSome recent public reporting on local ALPRs includes: \r\n\r\nICE Taps into Nationwide AI-Enabled Camera Network, Data Shows \r\n\r\nDEA agent used Illinois cop\u2019s Flock license plate reader password for immigration enforcement searches \r\n\r\nFeds Used Local Cop's Password to Do Immigration Surveillance With Flock Cameras \r\n\r\nCBP Had Access to More than 80,000 Flock AI Cameras Nationwide \r\n\r\nFlock Safety license plate camera company stops cooperating with federal agencies over investigation concerns \r\n\r\nFinally, it is important to note that the very data being withheld from the public is already uploaded in full to a private data broker, where it is stored in proprietary off-site systems and made available to Flock Safety system users. This practice constitutes an enclosure of public data collected without the consent of those targeted by municipal surveillance weapons. The public interest is evident and the request is clearly within the scope of FOIA. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. I anticipate your response within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nNiles Coalition \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\n\r\n*Giannoulias Cracks Down on Unlawful Use of License Plate Reader Data \r\n\r\n*Giannoulias\u2019 Audit Finds License Plate Reader Company in Violation of State Law \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnaperville-police-department-7679%252Falpr-audit-metadata-records-foia-naperville-police-department-192429%252F%253Femail%253Dkammerert%252540naperville.il.us&url_auth_token=AAAWBLjRWkMIO09p80e641Y2Fr8%3A1uuMQW%3AJPUogIcVx3IHc7SNbRwirSpNIMeEMiJoZXP9K7UTANQ \r\nYou can track this request online using the link below. \r\n https://napervilleil.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=294645&coid= (https://u8387795.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.PYICgxP3kfgZjR-2B4e9nPlDjrskbYiMhjSAiwtMJZmDd8N6QebRfGo5YYdfubMLs3g7KyxM4Qcm7PJqr7cWNqARJlcEKzGmboz8QSuEYNlrA5cB651bWAniVEbgzHYU-2BES9ER_TzXiufbJDwux6TG2niXcMzF2-2BjptB1zpD3jnejZ5d5O7Wrwdh4aJA0d9265DhMhZ0n8l2unIeH9bfKnkHvKr0mfEZPCFXpdsH6Doy7m2UAszratmIi6uRp-2FU2g3-2B7lkvsBTfRTW0KPU2KHZS7o3wjD2EgQTOUjUr137mMANnTbIW3bIVigrBh70Umzx80ao6JZ4XkWSqn6U-2BnyfPkHcWtuOjO2sQg0m5iLVSeH2FO4-2BbuqrxbLUpkgy9UIc-2BFbMH2KCR8w9-2F6K5kxXRd3LaXNLM0P265fNY3ZqKHuEW9B9Jhh4TirciSA-2BK9QhITbzSC6aKz6-2BWGQsxWp1AlOlSif6xRRM-2BBEVRJapGuUWC-2BNEqhvlr3qC99jZ-2FR7A5O4iBB8GrZB0yinCgzrdPaf-2BEHDA-3D-3D) \r\nIf the link above does not work, please visit the City of Naperville Help Center ( (https://u8387795.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.PYICgxP3kfgZjR-2B4e9nPlDjrskbYiMhjSAiwtMJZmDcuQ05ZHdE8j2vut1v3mCxwcVcGVIKQJdmG74Wz-2B61ux2tlhLoCwbBrYdSGfLqDJ2s-3DUf5k_TzXiufbJDwux6TG2niXcMzF2-2BjptB1zpD3jnejZ5d5O7Wrwdh4aJA0d9265DhMhZ0n8l2unIeH9bfKnkHvKr0mfEZPCFXpdsH6Doy7m2UAszratmIi6uRp-2FU2g3-2B7lkvsBTfRTW0KPU2KHZS7o3wjD2EgQTOUjUr137mMANnTbIW3bIVigrBh70Umzx80ao6JZ4XkWSqn6U-2BnyfPkHcWtuOjO2sQg0m5iLVSeH2FO4-2BbuqrxbLUpkgy9UIc-2BFbMHJngqOD1klbWnKQdzhLiM1rZ6gfOuJcTfLkicUK-2BpPxZOwi1HzJVKz8T-2BEMcz-2BthLIoK73IdsBeORWCWDJM3hwRKWxuPRS91t7vFXzu92LswevqjQhjSla7BL0HmmJNQyzaYG6KJtz9jULPtqKpybSg-3D-3D) https://napervilleil.mycusthelp.com/webapp/_rs/SupportHome.aspx).
