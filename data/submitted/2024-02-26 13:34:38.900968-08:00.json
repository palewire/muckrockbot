        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll documentation is available on VanessaHolton.com\r\n\r\nIn November of 2020 I filed a State Bar Complaint against the General Counsel of California, Vanessa Lynne Holton. She retaliated by filing a police report with the San Rafael Police Dept. She did so on California State Bar letterhead, signing the report as the General Counsel. \r\n\r\nThis resulted in an Officer Bellamy leaving me two voice messages, one telling me to stop harassing Vanessa Holton, and to take down the website, a clear violation of my 1st  Amendment Right. The second call changed to charges of \u201cidentity theft,\u201d and the \u201cfalse impersonation of a person thru cyber means.\u201d That is a clear threat of criminal charges and abuse of both police and governmental authority\r\n\r\nAround March or April of 2021 I spoke twice with Officer Bellamy, hopefully recorded by the SRPD. In the first call he describes the report being on State Bar letterhead, signed by Vanessa Holton as the General Counsel. He explained he was unaware of the State Bar Complaint and apologized. Sadly though, he was unable to comprehend the identity theft statute. He seemed to think just calling myself Vanessa Holton was enough.\r\n\r\nIn the second call he becomes a little nastier, telling me he does not care about my religious views, and that the report was being closed. When I requested to speak with a senior officer, I later received a call from Lt. Bishop. He informed me that the report had been blacked out, the California State Bar letterhead, the title under her signature, any reference to the California State Bar, gone. \r\n\r\nOn the website you will find two documents from the SRPD, one dated 17 Jan 2023, a FOIA response where the \u201cvictims\u201d name was not released. My crime was building a website to harass and defame the victim, a public figure. \r\n\r\nI guess Vanessa Holton never watched Saturday Night Live. Date of the report was November 23, 2020\r\n\r\nThe second letter, dated November 9th, 2022, almost two years later, informs me that my FOIA was rejected as the report is still an \u201cinvestigative report. This is in clear violation of both my 1st Amendment and 6th Amendment Rights. You can listen to the two recordings from Officer Bellamy there as well. (Video is AI enhanced for your enjoyment!)\r\n\r\nThe reason they kept the report open was to protect Vanessa Holton. (See letter from State Bar Office of Chief Trial Counsel by Special Deputy Rizamarie Gonzaga Sitton.) \r\n\r\nI am asking for a full and correct FOIA disclosure for #SR-20-07929 from the San Rafael Police Dept., with as unredacted a copy of the report filed by Vanessa Holton as allowed. \r\n\r\nI am also asking for four (4) audio recordings between my cellphone (818) 310-5073 and the San Rafael PD. The two with Officer Bellamy, the one with Lt. Bishop, and the one in January of 2023. The last call was where I was told the case was closed, no I could not file a false report complaint as \u201canyone can file a report.\u201d \r\n\r\nI guess San Rafael PD is unaware of California Penal Code 148.5 PC. An audio copy is desired.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The \"Abasha Experiment\" or \"Abasha agricultural experiment\" or \"\u0410\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\" was an economic reform undertaken by then-First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Eduard Shevardnadze in 1971 in the rural agricultural community of Abasha. The economic experiment generated considerable news coverage at the time, and some academic study since. \r\n\r\nThis is a request for all documents generated by the agency regarding what was either formally or colloquially known as the \"Abasha Experiment\" that began in 1971.

The Abasha Experiment is a topic of common conversation in the country of Georgia, but finding English language information online regarding this project is difficult.

Any opinion issued that mentions or includes the keywords \"partial administration\" or \"partial medication administration\" either as a formal opinion or other formal document specific to Registered Nurses.\r\n2. Any an email sent by the person or person(s) with the authority to opine and clarify nuances and specificity referring specifically to RN scope of practice such as by the DON, ADON, CNO (if an available position at your agency), or a similar high-ranking nursing professional of a different title OR non-nursing professional if such person(s) exist that can issue authoritative opinions on the matter, whichever appropriate person(s) exist within your agency. If specificity is required for this criterion, please refer to the keywords above. I'm aware of the ANA Scope of Practice and it does not opine on partial administrations with any degree of specificity or nuance.  I request emails where such person(s) are either sender, recipient, cc, or bcc, but please exclude baileypillon@gmail dot com as sender and/or recipient in the responsive records unless noted in a response (I apologize in advance) to this email.\r\n3. Regarding (1) and (2), I request to know the specific contexts in which a partial medication administration is permissible, if at all, and if it is specific to the setting, if it is the case. If so, please specify what contexts it is permissible and when nursing judgment and critical thinking reasonably applies when considering the reasonable, prudent legal standard that RNs are held to.\r\n4. The titles of the person(s) that typically work on EMR/EHRs and the percentage of those persons who are medical professionals that hold an active license from 2019-2024, if it is known to our agency. Please breakdown by year, if possible.\r\n5. If there is a differentiation regarding partial administrations (assuming it is within scope at all) between RNs and LPNs and if it varies depending on the setting and/or context within this specific criterion (5).\r\n6. If a partial medication administration is indeed within the scope of practice within RNs, I wish to know in what manner a healthcare facility may limit or entirely restrict partial administrations, if instructed nursing leadership or noted in the facility policies/procedures.\r\n7. The precise policies/procedures taken by your agency in the event that legal action (in the form of a civil or criminal suit specifically by your agency) is taken against a licensed nursing or other medical professional, including the titles of the person(s) involved.\r\n8. Any documents, if it is the case that a rare, one time partial administration is not within the scope of practice for RNs, that state the rationale as to why it is not within scope according to your agency.\r\n9. Any documents or opinions issued by your agency that set forth an opinion, guidelines, or other type of document wherein there is a clinical disagreement between the RN and MD/DO/ARNP/PA regarding an order, according to clinical judgment, if it conflicts between the RN and provider.\r\n10. Any documents wherein a non-nursing medical professional (specifically an MD/DO) can decide (and if it is legal) what is or isn't within the scope of practice for an RN, given that the provider is not an RN.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records for the above criteria exceed 200 records, please provide the number of responsive records by each criterion so that I can narrow the scope and/or time frame of this request. I sincerely appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and such documents made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I grant permission for fees up to $50.

DPS will seek reimbursement for reasonable fees pursuant to our charging chart and consistent with Georgia law.  For fee information, please see O.C.G.A. \u00a750-18-71.  You may review our charging chart at https://dps.georgia.gov/charging-fees-open-records-requests.  If the costs exceed $25.00, we will wait for your agreement to pay the estimated costs before completing the request.  Please see O.C.G.A. \u00a750-18-71(d).\r\n\r\nGenerally, our requestors seek dashcam videos for known events, including citations, crashes, incidents, and arrests.  At a minimum, the requestor provides the name of the subject person, which allows us to pull associated reports to locate any dashcam video.  Even then, dashcam video is not releasable if there are citations issued, if an arrest has been made or if there is a pending investigation which is usually the case for pursuits.  Please see O.C.G.A. 50-18-72(a)(4).  When an investigation is pending, the requestor is tasked with providing either a criminal disposition sheet, a Judge\u2019s Order, or the respective prosecutor\u2019s written authorization before we may release the dashcam video.\r\n\r\nIf you request all GSP pursuits without a timeframe, we will have to go through hours of video footage without knowing the names of subjects involved and without being able to match those names to citations, crash, incident, or arrest reports.  Then we will have to determine which videos were releasable.  It will be an extremely costly and time-consuming task.\r\n\r\nPlease consider narrowing your request.  If you have a specific video that you want to request, please advise so we may assist.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nPatience Patterson\r\nProject Data Analyst\r\nGeorgia Department of Public Safety\r\nLegal Services Department\r\n959 E.
