        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOn March 26th my father myself and my fiance were pulled over leaving life storage self storage on Murphy in Irvine sometime between 3pm  & 6pm or after?. I was ordered at gun point to exit vehicle. I was searched against my will, as well as my wife who requested a female officer for any pat down as she was not comfortable with treatment we were receiving but was searched by a male anyways. Pressured to have vehicle searched which I refused.. After 45 minutes they finished their investigation and told us we're free to go. I asked why they stopped us in the first place and was told that employee from storage (falsely) claimed that we broke into storage units.  I was there 20 minutes and only dropped stuff off, left with nothing so I completely didn't understand and need a report plus body cam leading up to the stop when the employee made his report/statement to officers that responded to take his statement prior and ultimately leading immediately to our interaction. I'm requesting this In order to possibly pursue legal action against storage company. I requested names and badge numbers several times and in the end was only given an incident# ,  2 names and 1 badge number. Officer Gomi/Carrasco badge #666 \r\nIncident# 240311989\r\nMarch 26th 2024\r\nOriginated at Life storage on Murphy \r\nPulled over on mcgaw\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Quinteros",
