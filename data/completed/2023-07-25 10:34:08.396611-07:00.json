The City requests the following information to evaluate your fee waiver request:\r\n\r\n1) How do you or your organization intend to use the information?  (Please answer regarding the specific information requested as opposed to speaking generally regarding information on the general topic requested);\r\n\r\nThe emails obtained through this request may be used as the basis of an article on the ongoing deliberations about which gunshot detection firm to work with. \r\n\r\n2) How will the information benefit the wider public?  (Please explain how this specific information assists the public given the information already provided to the public on this topic);\r\n\r\nWe believe there is a strong public interest in reporting these matters, not least because Shotspotter/SoundThinking is a rapidly growing policing technology company on which hundreds of police departments rely and the company is working actively to secure a contract with the Portland Police Bureau. Because this is a public procurement process, the public has a strong interest in full transparency into this process and conversations that are happening between public officials such as the police and any vendors they are considering working with. \r\n\r\n3) How do you or your organization intend to disseminate the information to the wider public?\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the documents we will determine if they warrant coverage through some sort of journalistic work including but not limited to written articles, podcasts, or videos. \r\n\r\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files mentioning or describing Terence Hallinan (December 4, 1936 \u2013 January\r\n    17, 2020), who was an American attorney and politician from San Francisco,\r\n    California.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The city or county agency will contact you concerning your request and inform you whether there are public records responsive to your request, if all or part of those public records are not disclosable to you, and the statutory basis for any denial. Information pertaining to any copying fees that may be related to obtaining copies will be provided. \nPlease Note:\u00a0 With respect to public records requests that include e-mail communications, we want to make you aware that these requests generally take longer than requests for other types of information.\u00a0 First, the City/County receives a large number of requests for email communications, not just public records requests but also related to legal proceedings.\u00a0 We rely upon our information technology agency to perform these searches and that agency runs these searches (based\u00a0 upon reasonably particular search terms as set forth by the State Public Access Counselor) in the order in which the requests are received.\u00a0 Once the email search is completed, there must also be a review of the content of the email communications to ensure that they are not only responsive to your request but also disclosable.\u00a0 Finally, disclosable email communications will be produced after this review and if we do not disclose all or part of these email communications, we will provide the statutory bases for such denials as required under the APRA. \nThe APRA requires public agencies to produce responsive and disclosable public records, should they exist, within a reasonable time based upon the circumstances.\u00a0 \u00a0Please allow the agency time to review and process your request. \nWhile there is no fixed due date for a response, if more than 30 days have passed since your last communication with the agency, feel free to contact the Public Access Counselor to check the status. \nYou may reach the Public Access Counselor at 317.327.4055 or PAC@indy.gov. \nThank you, \nCity of Indianapolis and Marion County\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I\r\n    have previously written about the government and its activities, with\r\n    some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo,\r\n    MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn\r\n    Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of\r\n    publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established.\r\n    In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them\r\n    available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and\r\n    and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large\r\n    audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of\r\n    it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate\r\n    the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n    Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to\r\n    disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the\r\n    public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,\r\n    19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that\r\n    \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number\r\n    of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as\r\n    a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on\r\n    the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires\r\n    that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id.\r\n    \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there\r\n    is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As\r\n    such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of\r\n    determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by\r\n    reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees\r\n    be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records relating to or mentioning a group which the FBI referred to as a\r\n    \"black street gang known as the \"FOLKS\".\"\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
