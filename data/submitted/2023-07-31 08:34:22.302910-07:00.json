However, I noticed you redacted the entire birth date field, and not just the month and day. I certainly agree that specific birth dates are private information, but I think that simply providing a birth year, which establishes a person's age, is important demographic information, along the same lines as race or gender. Additionally, I have been able to get this information from other agencies in the past, and so I believe the precedent establishes that a person's birth year (notwithstanding their precise birth day) is public information.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I am wondering if you would provide a copy of the roster document, but with the redaction slightly reduced, to reveal the birth year (but not day or month) of each officer.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration (and for your work on this so far),\r\nBrian Waters",

We received your request on July 24, 2023.  Your request\r\nconcerns a copy of the letter Mr. Michael Cicus sent to Senator Javits as\r\nwell as the letter Senator Javits attached to Mr. Circus\u2019 letter for\r\ntransmitting the request to the Department of Defense.\r\n\r\nOur office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for NARA\u2019s operational records\r\n(records created by this agency).  Because your FOIA request is for records\r\nthat may be archival records (records created by or originated in a\r\ndifferent agency but that may have been transferred to the legal custody of\r\nNARA), we are forwarding it by this email to our Office of Research\r\nServices, Textual Reference (RR2RR) staff who handle FOIA requests for\r\ntextual archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number and respond directly\r\nto you. In the future, if you need to follow up with that office directly,\r\nplease contact them at the address below, or electronically via email\r\n(email is preferred).\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\nResearch Services, Textual Reference Branch (RR2RR)\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 2400\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nPhone: 301-837-3091\r\nFax: 301-837-1752\r\nEmail: archives2reference@nara.gov\r\n\r\nFor your reference, a copy of your request is below.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.archives.gov/foia for further information\r\nabout making a FOIA request to NARA.  On our main website,\r\nwww.archives.gov, you\r\ncan learn more about the resources we offer to the public, and you can\r\naccess our online catalog.\r\n\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursuant to guidance received from the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA had adjusted its normal\r\noperations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work\r\nwhile also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of\r\nour staff. As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may\r\nexperience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.
