Your request asked for: Any and all Service Requests made to the City of Novato from January 1st, 2022 to December 12th 2024 that refer to \"Lee Gerner Park\" and/or \"homeless\" and/or \"Tent\" \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.535, subdivision (a), this message shall serve as a formal response to your request. This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. \r\n\r\nThe City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000327-121324  I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to the statutory exemptions noted below: \r\n\r\n Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. As such, we have redacted personally identifying information including home addresses, telephone numbers, and license plate numbers. Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. For questions or additional information, please reply to this email. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk",

Specifically this is a request for any presentations created for, or delivered to, members of the Presidential Transition Team for the new Administration (2nd Trump term) in November and December 2024. Please include any materials (documents, Excel files, PowerPoint presentations, audio/visual) from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (or \"PCAST\") which is under the umbrella of the Office of Science of Technology Policy. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is information related to pandemic planning or deliberations related to executive branch planning for the responses to the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV, Monkeypox, COVID-19, West Nile virus, Coxsackie, H1N1, etc. \r\n\r\nAccording to several books and much media coverage, President Trump claimed at the outset of the COVID-19 that there was no nearly no documentation or planning shared during the 2016/2017 transition related to pandemic planning, while members of the Obama administration have publicly claimed that OSTP pandemic planning documents were ignored. Any documents related to the efficacy of the Biden administration's response to Monkeypox or Covid-19 or HIV would be of particular interest. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Office of Science and Technology Policy's commitment to transparency. The release of these documents would be of a great public benefit in understanding the pandemic and the public health challenges we face.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Transportation:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Transportation component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request imposes an affirmative obligation to take immediate steps to preserve responsive records against spoliation, including both any automated or routine record deletion and any act by an employee to delete such records.\r\n\r\nThis is an explicit evidence preservation demand, and the documents sought relate to ongoing and/or currently contemplated litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, please note that this request is directed at BOTH Department of Transportation itself, and ALL components thereof, including any component agencies.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n\r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Chief FOIA Officers' desktops\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. for the component's\r\na) Chief FOIA Officer,\r\nb) Chief Privacy Officer, and\r\nc) any substantially equivalent component official\r\n\r\n(\"Officer\"):\r\n\r\n2. the entire content of\r\na) the Officer's physical desktops, i.e. everything on the actual desk(s) where they work\r\n\r\nI) including all other office surfaces, e.g. cabinets, tables, in/out boxes, shelves, etc in the Officer's office(s)\r\n\r\nII) excluding:\r\ni) computers (including desktop, laptop, and phone);\r\nii) USB drives;\r\niii) generic office supplies, i.e. any item that could be purchased off the shelf at a store such as Office Depot in identical form by a member of the general public;\r\niv) tear-off daily flip calendars;\r\nv) purely personal capacity items;\r\nvi) keys;\r\nvii) anything within a fully enclosed hard sided container (e.g. exclude the contents of a desk / cabinet drawer, lockbox, or picture frame \u2014 but envelopes laying on a desk [and their contents], items in open-ended organizers, etc are not excluded);\r\nviii) books or hard-bound booklets, except for the front and back covers; and\r\nix) CDs or DVDs, except for the label (i.e. what is captured when you place the disc on a flatbed scanner); and\r\n\r\nIII) formatted as 600 DPI color scans to PDF, one PDF per item (named logically based on the item), run through Adobe Acrobat Pro's \"enhance scanned PDF\" tool with the settings:\r\n* recognize text on\r\n* all pages\r\n* apply adaptive compression: grayscale JPEG2000, monochrome JBIG2 (lossless), maximum quality\r\n* output: searchable image, document language set to the document's actual language\r\n* filters: deskew on, background removal off, descreen off, text sharpening off;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nb) the Officer's computer desktop(s), i.e. the \"desktop folder\" of their account on every computer that they use in official capacity\r\n\r\nI) in the exact original file format as stored on the computer, encapsulated into a .ZIP or .TAR.GZ archive set to preserve all metadata and folder structure;\r\n\r\n3. as the above exist at the time anyone in the component first learns of this request.\r\n\r\n(I.e., no clearing out the desk before searching it. You may of course continue to use the office normally, but this request creates a hold for its exact content at that one snapshot in time.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. For hold preservation validation purposes, please take and provide digital photos of the Officer's entire office, showing all items in plain view at the time this request was received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe search time for this request should be zero, since all responsive records are literally already in plain view in the Officer's office.\r\n\r\nThis request is very clearly delineated such that search should be easy and the locations of records clearly identified.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to negotiate terms, we are open to doing so, but only if you provide actual reasons, not conclusory and inapposite statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.0\r\n###\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1.\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

CSU will make available to you any that are public. Please find the requested information attached.\r\nRecords subject to the following exemptions were withheld:\r\nWhen a police officer's anonymity is essential to his or her safety (e.g., undercover police), the need to protect the officer has been held to outweigh the public interest in disclosure and justifies withholding the officer's name. Long Beach Police Officers Association v. City of Long Beach (2014) 59 Cal.4th 59; Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 278.\r\nThe decision that certain records are exempt and will not be disclosed was made by the Records Access Officer at CSU Fullerton, Anne Grogan.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Grogan, ARM (she/her)\r\nCompliance Manager\r\nRisk Management & Compliance\r\nHuman Resources, Diversity, and Inclusion\r\nCalifornia State University, Fullerton\r\nP: 657-278-5465\r\n\r\n[Cal State Fullerton]\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DB551D.4851BB10] [cid:image004.jpg@01DB551D.4851BB10]   [cid:image005.png@01DB551D.4851BB10] [cid:image001.png@01DA26A5.AAF39380]\n",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

        "communication": "Dear Sai:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), which we received in our FOIA office via email on October 22, 2024. We have designated your inquiry as FOIA Request # 202500040F. Please include this request number on all correspondence with the FOIA office.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following information in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nWe respond to request on a first-in, first-out basis and on a multi-track system. Your request has been placed on the complex track. You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to identify specific documents in order to be eligible for the faster track. To do so, please send a written request, identifying the specific documents sought, to Export-Import Bank of the United States, 811 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20571, ATTN: FOIA OFFICER.  You may also submit a narrowed request via E-Mail at foia@exim.gov<mailto:foia@exim.gov>. The phrase \"Narrowed Request\" should appear on the letter and on the outside of the envelope containing the narrowed request or in the \"Subject\" line of the E-Mail. Please include the request number listed above on all correspondence with the FOIA office. We will notify you if your request is placed in the simple track.\r\n\r\nEXIM intends to disclose the requested records to the fullest extent of the law. Please be assured that we are processing your request as expeditiously as possible. However, the records you seek require a search in another Office, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii). Because of these unusual circumstances, we need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute. We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request. The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and the volume and complexity of any records located. In an effort to speed up your records search, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative timeframe for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we are considering your request for a fee waiver and will provide a response once a determination has been made.\r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Ms. Lennell Jackson at (202) 565-3290.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please feel free to contact me.

When you access that email message, you'll see a clickable \"button\" that says \"Access message here\", or something very close to that.\r\n\r\nClick on that button.\r\n\r\nThe system will instruct you to enter your email address. After you enter your email address you will be asked for a password. This is a password that you will create as this will be your Kiteworks account.  Once you enter your password you will be able to access your letter and responsive records.\r\n\r\nRemember these documents are only accessible for 30 days after which they expire. Please look for this message today and access the documents timely.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\nThe Census Bureau FOIA Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCensus - General",

To ensure accuracy, we had to create new queries to extract the data and map the account, department, and commodity descriptions from another source, which caused the delay.\r\nYou can access the updated data through the following link: Updated Data Link<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8jp77u5pua8of7cxei2hc/APLLmqest8zeUZQcCw0RnMI?rlkey=1xumabajqyqmzh02mbwbllktw&st=s7xs3dx7&dl=0>\r\n\r\nKey Points About the Data:\r\n\r\n  1.  As requested, I've included all three fields in the dataset and removed redundant dates.\r\n  2.  Commodity codes are only available for spend data from 2019 onward; all data prior to 2019 will have \"N/A\" for commodity codes. Additionally, departmental payments do not have mapped commodity codes.\r\n  3.  There are two date fields in the Pro Card data:\r\n     *   Transaction Date Actual (G.L.): The date the journal was posted to the General Ledger.\r\n     *   Pro Card Transaction Date: The actual transaction date of the Pro Card transaction.\r\nThank you,\r\nChristine\r\n\r\n\r\n=================================\r\nChristine M.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Villanueva, RAO, Massasoit Community College\r\n\r\nDear AJ Vincelli,\r\n\r\nI am writing to confirm receipt of your request and to initiate a response within ten (10) business days.\r\n\r\nIt is the College\u2019s intent to supply you with a fee estimate for this request. But before we provide the formal fee estimate, we wanted to inform you of the scope and scale of the work the College must conduct to produce these materials.\r\n\r\nThe College does not have an existing report that includes all of the information you are requesting. The College\u2019s Comptroller would therefore need to manually compile disparate reports to produce this information, all while reviewing the information closely to make any redactions needed. This time-intensive process would require at least four to six weeks (and at least 150 hours). At the $25/hour rate set by the Commonwealth\u2019s Public Records Law, we would anticipate a fee estimate of at least $3,750.\r\n\r\nPer your request, we invite you to modify your request as necessary. But please understand that there will likely still be a significant amount of \u201chuman time\u201d to review for redactions and may still necessitate a (albeit reduced) fee.\r\n\r\nUpon your response to this email or a revision of the request, we will issue the formal fee estimate for your review.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlex J.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I am hereby submitting a Public Records Request for all money given from Fitchburg State University to external vendors/suppliers in FY2015 through (and including) FY2024, a total of 10 years.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the data I am requesting include (but are not limited to):\r\n* all vendors, suppliers, individuals, and public-private partnerships\r\n* all materials, goods, services, properties, commodities, equipment leases, property leases, and licenses\r\n* all catalog orders, non-catalog orders, blanket orders, direct payments, bank card purchases, strategic sourcing, and competitive procurements\r\n* all auxiliary services purchases (starts in 2022, may be from a different accounting system)\r\n* all purchase orders, requisitions, and invoices\r\n* all products, goods, services, contracts, and subcontracts\r\n* all accounts, classes, commodities, and departments\r\n* regardless of the funding source\r\n\r\nI\u2019m requesting the data in a single Excel spreadsheet file (.xlsx format) with at least the following columns:\r\n* Amount\r\n* Supplier/Vendor Name\r\n* Account Description\r\n* Commodity Description\r\n* Fiscal Year\r\n* Department/Origin Description\r\n\r\nPlease report every expense, even if one or more of the above fields is blank. Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Complaint form\r\n2. Policies/Procedures regarding complaints\r\n\r\nIn reference to number one (1) of your request, you can locate our employee complaint form online. We have included the link below:\r\n\r\n  *   https://www.lvmpd.com/about/transparency/internal-affairs\r\n\r\nIn reference to number two (2) of your request please see attached as well as below.\r\n\r\n  The Public Records Unit forwarded your request to our Policy and Research Group and they determined the request, as worded is too broad. As currently requested, they are unable to confirm what documents are responsive.\r\n\r\nPlease note, you are seeking any/all records but have not sought a particular record about a particular event, and your request is otherwise overbroad and/or vague. As such, your request is not a request for a sufficiently identifiable record. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) is unable to conduct a simple \u201cGoogle\u201d-like search of its databases. We must ask that you narrow your request to a specific policy.\r\n\r\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) does not readily maintain any particular record containing the information you are seeking. Moreover, LVMPD databases cannot \u201creadily compile the requested information.\u201d See Public Employees Retirement System of Nevada v. Nevada Policy Research Inst., Inc., --- Nev. ---, 429 P.3d 280, 288 (2018), quoting Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t v. Blackjack Bonding, Inc., 131 Nev. 80, 87, 343 P.3d 608, 613 (2015). In other words, your request requires LVMPD to do more than simply \u201c[s]earch[] an electronic database to produce existing records and data\u2026.\u201d Public Employees Retirement System at 287, quoting ACLU of Arizona v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Child Safety, 377 P.3d 339, 346 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2016). Rather, your request requires LVMPD to \u201ccompile information about the information [the database] contains.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). As such, your request requires the creation of a new record, which LVMPD has no duty to do under the Nevada Public Records Act. Public Employees Retirement System at 286.\r\n\r\nIn order to inspect or copy a public record, the specific record must be identified by the person requesting the record. Courts in addressing this issue have held that \u201cagencies are required to disclose only \u2018identifiable\u2019 governmental records not otherwise exempt.\u201d Hodai v. City of Tucson & Tucson Police Dep\u2019t, 2014 Ariz. Super. LEXIS 2158, *18 (Ariz. Super. Ct. 2014), quoting MAG Entertainment, LLC v. Division of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067, 1076 (N.J. Sup. Ct., App. Div. 2005). \u201cWholesale requests for general information to be analyzed, collated and compiled by the responding government entity are not encompassed therein.\u201d Id. A governmental agency is not required to respond to an overbroad request that does not request specific records. MAG Entertainment at 1074, citing Capitol Information Association v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985); cf. NAC 239.863(1)(c) (public records request must include a description of the public record that is sufficient to identify the record).\r\n\r\nIf you obtain any additional information that may assist in our recovery of records you seek, a new request may be submitted. As a courtesy we are providing following policies, that may be responsive to your request.  2.225 Internal Affairs Bureau, 8.330 Maintenance of Values and Ethics & 8.355 Purging of disciplinary files (please see attachments).\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Records Unit\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\r\n400-A South Martin L.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm. Incident number or other unique identifier for each arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nn. Offender number or other unique identifier for each individual arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until\r\n\r\nthe day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D. Research Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration k.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n617-373-5862\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",
