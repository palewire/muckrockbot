A previous request to the FBI indicated potentially responsive records were moved to NARA, and indicated I should use \"44-HQ-16371\" as a reference number. \r\n\r\nI am making this request in my capacity as a journalist who has written extensively about government transparency, including several books on the FBI specifically. As such, I am not requesting a fee waiver, but I am requesting I be placed in the media requester category.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJPat Brown",
