Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production. \r\n\r\nIf the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on an alleged investigation, you must certify that the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, it is inappropriate to deny production of any responsive material to this request, if the statute of limitations for the motive of investigation has elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB. \r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n//s// Eleni Karen Villios\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEleni Karen Villios",

Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear.
