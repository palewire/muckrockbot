For example, $40.00, 2014; which would mean that that license would cost $40 from whatever the first date that I have recorded until the 2014, that license was $40. If the Year End column shows 9999, then that was the last, or current price, that we have.\r\n\r\nThere is also Last Year Sold and a First Year Recorded columns, since some of these licenses are no longer available, this should help you with the ranges of prices.\r\n\r\nThe Old Fee listed is the fee that was charged until 7/1/2023. This is when we  switched over to a hosting contractor. Some licenses didn't have a fee. The New Fee started on 7/1/2023. I don't know how you wanted to break the data down, but for the new fee there is the fee that the agent makes and a transaction fee associated with the license / permit. If the selling agent is WRC or the hosting contractor, then the agent gets $3 and the transaction fee is $2. If it is any other agent, then the agent gets $4 and the transaction fee is $1.\r\n\r\nThere is a separate tab for the reciprocal pricing. Any state that isn't listed on that tab pays the same amount as the NC fee.\r\n\r\nI hope this satisfies your request. If there is anything you need clarified or changed, please let me know.\n",

If one or more of these fields is unavailable, provide all fields and/or information that is available responsive to my request. If this information is not available in a spreadsheet or database format, please provide scans of the underlying use of force reports or (if unavailable) arrest reports. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please be advised, the last part of the use of force data report contains juvenile information, which will need to be redacted. While we expect to be able to provide it in October, there are thousands of lines of data within the report and each case will need to be reviewed in order for us to determine which pieces of information fall under juvenile exemptions, so we may need more time. We will provide another estimated response date by 10/03/25 if we require more time. \r\nPursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. \r\nIf you believe the information furnished has been incorrectly redacted or is incomplete, please reach out to the assigned staff by replying to this message. Please be advised that upon closure of your request, you may file a written appeal.

Anything below will not be viewable to staff. --- \r\n02/10/2026 P004584-073025 Samuel Sinyangwe, \r\nThe final installment of records responsive to your request are now available via the City of Bellevue Public Records Portal website.\u00a0Pop-ups may need to be enabled on your internet browser to access your files for download. This concludes our search of records in the custody of the Bellevue Police Department. This is our final, definitive response and your request is closed.\u00a0 As the city does not intend to further address the request, the Public Records Act one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has now started to run. Pursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. Please be advised, you may file a written appeal if you believe information has been incorrectly redacted or records have been incorrectly withheld. The appeal must include your name and address, a copy of the redacted document and a copy of this letter together with a brief statement identifying the basis of the appeal. Please mail your appeal to: Bellevue Police Department \r\nAttn: Records Supervisor \r\nP.O. Box 90012 \r\nBellevue, WA\u00a0 98009-9012 If you require any further assistance from the Bellevue Police Department regarding this matter or have questions, please contact the Records Unit via the Public Records Portal or by telephone at (425) 452-6917 within 30 days of this notification. Thank you, Jessica Abbott \r\nBellevue Police Department \r\nRPC 4.4 Inadvertent Disclosure Notification: CR 26 (b) (6) Claw Back Provision *** Please read this notice carefully *** Dear legal practitioner: Please take notice that we take reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of privileged or confidential materials, including those protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine, when responding to request for records.\u00a0 These precautions include, but are not limited to, carefully locating and assembling responsive records, performing an intra-departmental review of the records for purposes of determining whether they contain any privileged or confidential materials, forwarding the records to the County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for independent legal review, meeting and conferring with the Prosecuting Attorney's Office to compare and reconcile any conflicting results of our separate independent reviews and, if necessary, creating a withholding log.\u00a0 Despite our having taken these precautions, occasionally a mistake is made and privileged or confidential documents are inadvertently produced.\u00a0 To that end, we wanted to notify you that there is a possibility that the records being produced may contain privileged or confidential materials.\u00a0 The inadvertent or unintentional production of privileged or confidential documents, without a privileged or confidentiality designation should not be considered a waiver in whole or in part of any claim of privileged or confidential treatment, and any document that initially is produced without bearing a privileged or confidentiality designation may later be so designated.\u00a0 In the event that you believe you have received privileged or confidential materials, we would ask that you promptly notify us of this fact and take action as necessary to comply with the obligations set forth in Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4 and/or Civil Rule 26 (b)(6).",

        "communication": "Dear SB1421 Requesters and interested parties,\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the City of Fullerton has broken California\u2019s Public Record\u2019s Law, specifically related to SB1421, by denying you records which are quite clearly publicly disclosable.\r\n\r\nIn the link sent to you by Mea Klein, Assistant City Clerk, as provided to her by the City Attorney, you were told that there are 27 Officers \"REQUESTED BY NAME, BUT NO DISCLOSABLE FILE AVAILABLE (27)\u201d. This is patently false.\r\n\r\nThe City of Fullerton is currently suing me, my compatriot David and the blog Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future directly related to the findings on several of these officers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/>\r\n\r\nIn looking at this list I can quite easily name Officers on that list who have disclosable records under SB1421 including but not limited to Kathryn Hamel, Paul Irish, Miguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo, Christopher Wren & Nathan Roesler.\r\n\r\nA sustained finding was found against Hamel and one cannot simply unring that bell as seen in the recent Contra Costa County tentative decision (CASE NAME: RICHMOND POLICE VS. CITY OF RICHMOND <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Contra-Costa-Ruling-Case-MSN19-0169-2020-07-31.pdf>). \r\n\r\nThis FFFF article related to Hamel is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/>\r\n\r\nChristopher Wren had a sustained finding against for dishonesty related to a workplace affair with a subordinate. In IA Case #17-0038 one of the sustained findings against Officer Wren is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201c6. On December 17, 2017, when Lieutenant Cleggett asked you about your whereabouts, you dishonestly stated to Lieutenant Cleggett that you had been on the phone with your wife the entire time and did not notice Lieutenant Cleggett\u2019s text message.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement of dishonesty was directly related to misconduct as outlined in the timeline of Wren\u2019s activities and being in violation of policy. \r\n\r\nLikewise with Christopher Wren, this article is specifically listed in the lawsuit being waged against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/what-happened-to-officer-christopher-wren/\r\n\r\nThe idea that the city attorney is unaware of the sustained findings against their officers which are disclosable under SB1421 is laughable when those very stories are being used by the same attorneys as evidence in a lawsuit where the city seeks a prior restraint against myself and FFFF.\r\n\r\nThe blog has likewise published stories on how Paul Irish was terminated for dishonesty;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/>\r\n\r\nMiguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo admitted in the plea deal that he both used excessive force and falsified a police report.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/>\r\n\r\nNathan Roesler filed a false report with the City of Placentia which resulted in an innocent man being arrested for a crime that wasn\u2019t committed against Roesler. This was referred to the District Attorney for prosecution.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/>\r\n\r\nThese are the cases which are readily and easily pointed out which I believe to be disclosable under SB1421 which calls all of the other officers on the list into question. The City is blatantly lying to you, your organizations and agencies as well as the public and concerned entities about disclosable records despite being in a separate lawsuit over these very violations of SB1421.\r\n\r\nThey are likewise violating the law in regards to the officer whose records are \"PENDING; NOT YET PRODUCED (3)\u201d. The incident in Corbett\u2019s case was from 2016 and Paez\u2019s was in 2017. The timeline has long passed for required production in both of these cases.\r\n\r\nIf you are honestly seeking these records and others from the City of Fullerton you will likely have no recourse but to seek remedies in order to get to the truth. I have already been forced to take this route unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I wish you all the best in your efforts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Ferguson\r\nHost, The Hourly Struggle\r\nWriter, Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future\r\nConcerned Citizen\n",

        "communication": "Dear SB 1421 requesters and interested parties:\r\nYou have each recently received a mass email communication from an individual with whom the City of Fullerton is currently engaged in civil litigation, Joshua Ferguson.  The email contained inaccuracies about the City's responses to Public Records requests.  The City would like to correct certain information and assure you and other members of the public of its commitment to transparency and compliance with legal requirements for the disclosure of public records, including certain peace officer records recently made public under SB 1421, which is codified at Penal Code section 832.7.  Of course, the City cannot respond as to any specifics about any individual officers referenced, due to privacy.\r\n\r\nDisclosable use of force files:\r\nNot all use of force investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of those files involving uses of force that have resulted in death or \"great bodily injury.\"  Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \"Great bodily injury\" means \"significant or substantial physical injury.\"  Pen. Code section 16600.  Examples of \"great bodily injury\" include: broken bones, People v. Villarreal (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1141; gunshot wounds, People v. Mendias (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 195; and a dog bite, People v. Frazier (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 613, 618.  SB 1421 also mandates the disclosure of investigation files involving a peace officer or custodial officer's discharge of a firearm at a civilian.  See Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nDisclosable dishonesty files:\r\nNot all dishonesty investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of \"sustained finding[s] . . . [of] dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.\"  See Cal. Penal Code section 832.7(b)(1)(C) (emphasis added).\r\nThe Legislature intended to provide the public access to cases involving dishonesty, where an officer \"is proven to have planted evidence, committed perjury, or otherwise been dishonest in the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime.\"  Assembly Committee on Public Safety, Analysis of SB 1421 (June 26, 2018).\r\n\r\nIn order for acts of dishonesty to be disclosable under SB 1421, there must also have been a \"sustained\" finding of dishonesty.  A \"sustained finding\" is defined as \"a final determination by an investigating agency, commission, board, hearing officer, or arbitrator, as applicable, following an investigation and opportunity for an administrative appeal pursuant to Sections 3304 and 3304.5 of the Government Code, that the actions of the peace officer or custodial officer were found to violate law or department policy.\"  Pen. Code section 832.8 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIf an officer investigated for the type dishonesty or sexual assault that is disclosable under SB 1421 resigns prior to a sustained finding, his or her file is not disclosable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the email that you received referred to a specific court ruling (Richmond Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of Richmond), that ruling was only tentative (not final) and was only the ruling of one Superior Court Judge in Contra Costa County.  The City of Fullerton is located in Orange County, and is not subject to those courts or their rulings.  However, even a ruling in Orange County would not have been determinative, as facts in different cases may lead to different results, and a single judge's opinion is not required to be followed by other judges, until there is some binding opinion of higher courts.  In fact, in City of Richmond, that court found that the employer and an officer could not reverse sustained findings of dishonesty or sexual assault through a negotiated settlement, after the conclusion of a formal hearing process.  In circumstances where a final, formal hearing has not been held, the court acknowledged that there would be no \"sustained findings\" and hence such records are \"not disclosable under SB 1421.\"  (The City of Richmond court also noted that investigations of dishonesty involving subjects not specifically listed in Penal Code section 832.7 are also not disclosable).\r\n\r\nRegardless of the inapplicability of the City of Richmond opinion in Orange County, the City of Fullerton's disclosure of its records under SB 1421 does follow the same principles.\r\n\r\nThe City is committed to providing all records that it is required and permitted to release to the public relating to peace officers.  It has been working hard to review and release all records newly made releasable since the enactment of SB 1421, and will continue to do so. The City has produced 26 SB 1421 files; has partially produced 13 additional SB 1421 files; and has 2 SB 1421 files pending review (one of which awaits resolution of administrative or other proceedings).  The City's SB 1421 productions are available at www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421<http://www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421>, and a copy of the summary chart detailing the progress of the City's SB 1421 review and production is posted therein.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your requests or the City's production thereto, please contact the City Clerk's Office or the City Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nKimberly Hall Barlow\r\nJones & Mayer\r\n3777 N.

Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for information, the City maintains that information in its ordinary course of business, the information is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort. The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request.\r\n\r\nAfter a diligent search, the City has determined that it does not possess records responsive to your Request.\r\n\r\nWith this letter, the City considers your Request closed. If you have any questions regarding the City\u2019s response or would like to discuss your Request please contact me at thernandez@ci.capitola.ca.us<mailto:thernandez@ci.capitola.ca.us>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC967A.C9925820]\r\nTracie Hernandez\r\nPolice Records & Evidence Manager\r\nPhone: 831-475-4242 x202\r\nEmail: thernandez@ci.capitola.ca.us<mailto:thernandez@ci.capitola.ca.us>\r\nAddress: 422 Capitola Avenue\r\nWebsite: www.cityofcapitola.org<http://www.cityofcapitola.org/>\r\nInstagram: Capitola Police Department<https://www.instagram.com/capitolapolice/?hl=en>\r\nFacebook: Capitola Police Department<https://www.facebook.com/CapitolaPoliceDepartment>\r\n**CONFIDENTIAL:** This communication contains confidential information intended solely for the designated recipient(s).

However, it cannot be processed for the following reason(s):\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Request is overly broad (overbreadth issues).\r\n\r\nUnder longstanding FOIA precedents, \u201cbroad sweeping requests lacking specificity are not permissible.\u201d Marks v. United States (Dep\u2019t of Justice), 578 F.2d 261, 263 (9 Cir. 1978), see also, (\u201cRequest is too broad which seeks \u2018all unpublished manuscripts decisions of the Patent Office, together with such indices as are available.\u201d Irons v. Schuyler, 151 U.S App. D.C 23(1972)). See also, OSTP\u2019s regulation that reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OSTP personnel to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, a requester should include specific information that may assist OSTP personnel in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. In general, a requester should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought. 32 C.F.R.\u00a72402.4(b).\r\n\r\nThus, the request needs to be amended to identify the custodian(s) for the records mentioned herein. For instance, the request could be amended as follows:\r\n\r\nAll communications to or from OSTP\u2019s former Director, Dr. Arati Prabhakar, and current Director, Michael Kratisios, regarding\r\n\r\n\u201c- a)The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)\r\n- b)The SCREEN Act\r\n- c)Any U.S. age verification or online child safety policy proposals.\u201d\r\n\r\n- a)National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE)\r\n- b)Collective Shout\r\n- c)CEASE (Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation)\r\n- d)Carnegie UK Trust\r\n- e)Yoti (digital ID software provider)\r\n\r\n\r\n- a)The Online Safety Act (UK)\r\n- b)The Digital Services Act (DSA) (EU)\r\n- c)Impacts on U.S. tech companies or policymaking.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe responsive timeframe is January 1, 2022, to the present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the request could be amended as follows:\r\n\r\nAll communications between OSTP\u2019s former Director, Dr. Arati Prabhakar, and current Director, Michael Kratisios, and Ofcom and the European Commission regarding\r\n\r\na)The Online Safety Act (UK)\r\n- b)The Digital Services Act (DSA) (EU)\r\n- c)Impacts on U.S. tech companies or policymaking\r\n\r\nThe responsive timeframe is January 1, 2022, to the present.\r\n\r\nThose are examples of permissible requests.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA Office.",

Patel as special agent in charge of the New York Area of Responsibility. \r\n\r\nYour request was received in this office on 8/5/2025. \r\n\r\nAfter careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is not reasonably described due to the reason(s) listed below: \r\n\r\n-Your request is too broad in scop, please narrow. \r\n-Your request did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking. \r\nRecords must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, case number, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \r\n\r\n-Clearly identify the subject matter. \r\n-Provide a date range of X-X days/weeks/months/years. \r\n-Identify the specific program office, position titles, or individuals. \r\n-Avoid using general or ambiguous language (e.g. \u201call communications,\u201d \u201ceverything related to,\u201d \u201call records\u201d). \r\n\r\nIf you require assistance to reasonably describe the records you are seeking, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. You have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

Your request was received in this office on 8/5/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182.

Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMegan Davis \nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations\n",

Due to the inclement weather last week, staff availability, and the overall volume of requests, VCU will require the additional seven work days allowed for response pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3704(B)(4) as it is not practically possible to provide the requested information within the initial five work day period. You should expect a response by no later than close of business on Monday, February 16. However, I do not anticipate it will take that long and will send a response sooner if at all possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbigail Klose\r\n\r\nVCU FOIA Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Virginia Commonwealth University.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Pepin:\r\n\r\nAlthough you framed your request as an open records request, what you seem to be seeking is for us to collect statistical data. You requested information regarding the Family Member Care Tax Credit including:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Number of returns that claimed the credit\r\n  2.  Total amount of credits claimed ($)\r\n  3.  If available, (1) and (2) separately by taxpayer characteristics, such as filing status, marital status, age of taxpayer, AGI range, number of dependents, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause the purpose of an open records request is to obtain copies of records that already exist, our response to your request as an open records request would be that we have no documents responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nHowever, we were able to collect the data you were seeking. Attached to this email is an Excel document with the information we were able to pull from our system. The credit information is stated by year, amount, and number of claimants, and contains two tables sorting the information by federal AGI and filing status. Please note that the earliest available information is from tax year 2000, and that these totals reflect the actual credit amount claimed on individual income tax returns based on the unique circumstances of each return.\r\n\r\nBased on changes in tax law in 2023, which generally eliminated the payment obligation for the lowest bracket of individual income tax (approximately Federal taxable income of $50,000 and below), there are no credit amounts to report for the period of 2023 through present.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of any further assistance with regard to this request, please reach out to me at mfdanielson@nd.gov<mailto:mfdanielson@nd.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Danielson\r\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General\r\nNORTH DAKOTA OFFICE OF STATE TAX COMMISSIONER\r\n600 E Boulevard Ave., Dept. 127\r\nBismarck, ND 58505-0599\r\nP: 701-328-2781  |  Fax: 701-328-3700  |  nd.gov/tax<http://www.nd.gov/tax>\r\n\n[cid:image001.png@01DC99CC.587764F0]",

Should the fees exceed $100, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees as I am requesting the information on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how master jury lists are created. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\nIf possible, please provide the requested documents electronically. However, if this is not feasible, please inform me of the available methods for obtaining these records. Further, if you expect a significant delay in responding to this request, please contact me with information concerning when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption that justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within the timeframe required by the statute.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am not sure why your previous requests were not seen until today and apologize for the inconvenience that may have been caused. Your request is for talking points, scripts, and notes used to prepare for the press conference held on April 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe link provided did not work for me, however I located the press release and believe you are referring to the \"RRHA Addresses Lease Enforcement Cases Due to Non-Payment of Rent\" Press Conference held on April 19, 2024 at 10 a.m. Please let me know if I am incorrect.\r\n\r\nUpon further review, a response will be provided to you within 5 business days of your initial request date. Day 1 is considered the day after your request is received. The five-day period does not include weekends or holidays.  If it is not practically possible to identify, locate, or provide the records you requested within 5 business days, RRHA may require an additional 7 business days to respond to your request pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3704(B)(4).\r\n\r\nRRHA reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for searching, duplicating, and supplying the requested records, but the fee shall not exceed the actual costs incurred. You may request an estimate of the cost in advance of receiving the requested records.  All requests received by RRHA are handled pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3700.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want to modify your request or if you have any questions.

This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request and to locate, assemble, and review the requested records.  RCW 42.56.520 Please note that this request may be subject to applicable fees as permitted by the PRA. RCW 42.56.120. The District\u00a0charges 5 cents for 4 electronic files/or attachments. RCW 42.56.120(2)(b)(iii). We will let you know in advance if there will be a fee and whether, in keeping with RCW 42.56.120(4), a 10% fee deposit will be required before we proceed with your request. Please be aware that, in keeping with our obligations under the Washington Public Records Act (PRA), any information that personally identifies a student (unless the requestor is that student\u2019s parent or guardian) must be redacted from all materials provided in response to a public records request. RCW 42.56.230(1). We ran some preliminary searches to get a sense for the number of potentially responsive emails. A search for emails from/to/cc @wssda.org returned only 8 emails, which have been uploaded here: Public Records Request - R000275-121625  A search for messages from/to/cc \u201cwssda\u201d returned 111,302 messages, many of which were mass mailings relating to news updates. When we ran a search omitting the most common of those bulk messages (using the search terms below), we had 29,840 messages. The applicable fee for that number of messages would be over $350 \u2013 and it seems possible that a large number of those emails might not be of interest to you. We ran that same search just for the period from 12/1/25 to 12/16/25 and had 31 results. We have attached those messages so you can take a look at the types of records the search is pulling up. If you have additional search terms you would like us to use or a specific date range that you would like us to pull first, please let us know. We want to make sure you get what you are interested in without unnecessary expense and without having to slog through records that are of no interest to you. Once we have your direction for a revised search, or your go-ahead to continue with the 29,840-result search, we will provide you with an anticipated fulfillment date and a fee estimate. Please let us know if you have any questions. Sincerely, Sarah Kolpacoff \r\nPublic Records Officer",

My name is Joseph Anderson\u00a0and I am a Deputy Public Records Officer\u00a0for Skamania County. I assist inreviewing and responding to public records requests (PRRs) for alldepartments. \r\n\r\nOn February 03, 2026, I received your public records request as follows: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current \"Brady lists\" and \"Giglio lists\" (per Brady v. Maryland/Giglio v. United States) maintained by your office, along with accompanying potential impeachment material. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRose Terse \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://www.muckrock.com/respond/2208085/.\" \r\nPlease note that Skamania County does not have a ' Brady List' per se.  There is one (1) deputy that worksfor the Skamania County Sheriff\u2019s Office for whom we have potentialimpeachment information and for whom we provide a memo disclosing and summarizing thecircumstances. We provide this memo when required to defense counsel oncases involving this deputy. Because there is only one (1) local deputy forwhom we maintain potential impeachment disclosure information, there is no list. Just the singlememo, which we are happy to provide [ please see attached]. \r\n\r\nTheWashington State Patrol sometimes sends us information from state-widepotential impeachment issues with WSP employees. We do not maintain thisinformation in any organized way because it does not apply to anyofficers that regularly appear in our courts/cases. I just want toconfirm that these records are not made into any list, and to the extentthat these records are related to WSP employees, are likely bettersought from the WSP directly, if you\u2019re interested in the raw data (inaddition to any lists). After reviewing our files, we have located records that are responsive to your request. Please log in to the Skamania County Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the records responsive to your request: County Public Records Request - C003886-020326\r\nSkamaniaCounty has searched for, attempted to identify, locate, and provide anynon-exempt public records that may be responsive to this request. Since this completely fulfills your request, we are now closing this public records request. The one (1) yearstatute of limitations to seek judicial review under the Public RecordsAct (Chapter 42.56 RCW) begins now because Skamania County does notintend to further address this request. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns by replying to this email or at my phone number below. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson \r\nDeputy Public Records Officer \r\nOffice of the Skamania County Prosecuting Attorney \r\n240 NW Vancouver Avenue | PO Box 790 \r\nStevenson, WA 98648 \r\n509-427-3791",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear David Moore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of Watsonville (\u201cCity\u201d) is in receipt of the Public Records Act request you submitted, received on January 26, 2026 (\u201cRequest\u201d).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City intends to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d). (Government Code section 7920.000 et seq.) Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for the record, that record is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the record is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort. The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions, requests for information, or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe City has determined that it possesses records responsive to your Request. However, the City is withholding the responsive records pursuant to California Civil Code section 1798.90.55(b). (See also Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 7927.705.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this letter and production, the City considers this Request complete. If you have any questions regarding the City\u2019s response or would like to discuss your Request, please contact me at cityclerk@watsonville.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCity Clerk's Office\r\n\r\n(831) 768-3010\r\n\r\n275 Main Street, Suite 400, Watsonville, CA 95076\r\n\r\nFAX:&nbsp;831-761-0736\r\n\r\nE-mail:&nbsp;&nbsp;cityclerk@watsonville.gov\r\n\r\nOpen Monday - Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Watsonville, CA.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\nSincerely, Jessica Riley \r\n330-978-8228\r\njlr00026@mix.wvu.edu",
