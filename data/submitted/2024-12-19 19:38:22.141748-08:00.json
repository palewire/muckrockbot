No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever.

No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In CSV, TXT, or XML format, a machine-readable spreadsheet (not XLSX format). This data must include whether or not the Alternative Response Program or any iteration of that response team was dispatched and include a unique identifier to be able to match the data to the 911 CAD data from the City of Durham.\r\n\r\nHere are the column headers which are requested:\r\n\r\nMaster Incident Number or Event Number \u2013 Unique numerical identifier of the call for service that can be matched to City of Durham 911 CAD data\r\nCase Number \u2013 If an incident report was written, this is the file number, which can be joined to the incidents and arrests datasets\r\nDispatcher ID - A unique identifier for the dispatcher who handled and managed the 911 call\r\nCrisis Call Diversion Staff ID - A unique identifier for the dispatcher who received the call from the 911 dispatcher\r\nCall Date \u2013 Date the call for service was generated\r\nCall Time \u2013 Time the call for service was generated\r\nSource \u2013 How the call was generated from the public or self-initiated by an officer\r\nPriority \u2013 The priority level of the call response\r\nNature \u2013 The description of the call for service\r\nAddress \u2013 The block number and street or intersection of the call for service\r\nLatitude/longitude - coordinates for call of service\r\nX \u2013 Mapping coordinate of the call for service\r\nY \u2013 Mapping coordinate of the call for service\r\nDistrict \u2013 The patrol district where the call for service was located\r\nBeat \u2013 The patrol beat where the call for service was located, which is a sub-division of the district\r\nTract \u2013 The census tract where the incident occurred, based on 2010 census data\r\nDisposition \u2013 How the call for service was closed\r\nCancelled \u2013 Whether the call for service was cancelled prior to officer arrival\r\nWho was dispatched - Whether CCD, CRT, COR, police, fire, or EMS\r\nDispatch Date and Time - The exact date and time when the dispatcher sent the call to emergency responders, such as CRT, COR, police, fire, or EMS\r\nEntry Date and Time - The date and time when the call was initially logged into the 911 computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system\r\nReceived Date and Time - The date and time when the 911 call was first answered by the dispatch center\r\nEnroute Date and Time - The date and time when the assigned responder (e.g., a patrol car, ambulance, or fire truck) began traveling to the incident location\r\nOn Scene Date and Time - The date and time when the responder arrived at the scene of the incident\r\nClose Date and Time - The date and time when the incident or call was marked as completed or resolved in the CAD system\r\n\r\nWe also have questions pertaining to the data and HEART: \r\n\r\n-In 911 CAD data from the City of Durham, the \"mental health crisis\" code does not exist before HEART. What were the relevant codes/terminology in the data that existed before the existence of DCSD or HEART?\r\n\r\n-Does the nature code \"heart assist\" refer to the HEART program or to the body organ?\r\n\r\n-Is the nature code \"involuntary commitment\" specific to the involvement of PD, EMS, fire, CCD, COR, or CRT?\r\n\r\n-We are seeing a number of duplicates in the data. These duplicates seem to be generated when the call is received by a CCD staff member and then PD, COR, CRT, fire, or EMS are dispatched. Please see the attached screenshot as an example of such a duplicate. Is the above assumption correct? Also, specific to the screenshot, who exactly was dispatched? EMS, PD, and a back-up unit?\r\n\r\n-Is this operational information correct?\r\nThe Community Response Team is made up of a mental health Clinician, a Peer Support Specialist, and an EMT.\r\nThe Co-Response Team is made up of a mental health clinician with a police officer.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords related to water and wastewater utility payment plans specifically seeking records that detail the following:\r\n\r\nPayment plan records, agreements, and supporting documentation for the following individuals from 2020 to the present--\r\n\r\n1. All elected officials (including mayors, trustees, commissioners, and other elected and appointed officials).\r\n\r\n2. Immediate family members (including spouses, children, parents and other immediate relatives) of the officials listed above.\r\n\r\nFor each payment plan, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nThe recipient\u2019s full name (unless prohibited by law, which I dispute as outlined below).\r\n\r\nThe address or account location related to the payment plan.\r\n\r\nThe total payment amount and schedule of payments associated with the payment plan.\r\n\r\nThe effective date of the payment plan and any records related to its approval.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence or documentation regarding how eligibility for the payment plan was determined.\r\n\r\nI understand that under FOIA (and related state public records laws), agencies may attempt to withhold or redact the names and addresses of individuals under the claim that such information is \"personal\" or \"private.\" However, I respectfully submit that in this case, such redactions would be inappropriate and contrary to the public interest.\r\n\r\nWhile private citizens generally have a reasonable expectation of privacy, public officials and their immediate family members do not share the same expectation when it comes to receiving public benefits or financial relief.\r\n\r\nThe information requested (names, addresses, and payment plans) does not expose sensitive private information like Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, or health data. Instead, it reveals details of how public resources are being allocated, which is precisely the type of information public records laws are designed to make accessible.\r\n\r\nPublic disclosure is essential to allow journalists, watchdog groups, and citizens to identify patterns of favoritism or special treatment for certain individuals or groups.\r\n\r\nNames and addresses are already found in public property records, voting rolls, and other public databases. If the recipient\u2019s name and address are already public in other contexts, redacting them here serves no meaningful privacy interest but instead obstructs accountability.\r\n\r\n*****If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, I ask that you provide the following:\r\n\r\n1. The specific legal exemption(s) being claimed for each redaction or denial.\r\n\r\n2. An explanation of how the exemption applies to the specific information being withheld.\r\n\r\n3. A list or index of withheld documents, as required under applicable \"Vaughn Index\" procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Complaint form\r\n2. Policies/Procedures regarding complaints\r\n\r\nIn reference to number one (1) of your request, you can locate our employee complaint form online. We have included the link below:\r\n\r\n  *   https://www.lvmpd.com/about/transparency/internal-affairs\r\n\r\nIn reference to number two (2) of your request please see attached as well as below.\r\n\r\n  The Public Records Unit forwarded your request to our Policy and Research Group and they determined the request, as worded is too broad. As currently requested, they are unable to confirm what documents are responsive.\r\n\r\nPlease note, you are seeking any/all records but have not sought a particular record about a particular event, and your request is otherwise overbroad and/or vague. As such, your request is not a request for a sufficiently identifiable record. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) is unable to conduct a simple \u201cGoogle\u201d-like search of its databases. We must ask that you narrow your request to a specific policy.\r\n\r\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) does not readily maintain any particular record containing the information you are seeking. Moreover, LVMPD databases cannot \u201creadily compile the requested information.\u201d See Public Employees Retirement System of Nevada v. Nevada Policy Research Inst., Inc., --- Nev. ---, 429 P.3d 280, 288 (2018), quoting Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t v. Blackjack Bonding, Inc., 131 Nev. 80, 87, 343 P.3d 608, 613 (2015). In other words, your request requires LVMPD to do more than simply \u201c[s]earch[] an electronic database to produce existing records and data\u2026.\u201d Public Employees Retirement System at 287, quoting ACLU of Arizona v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Child Safety, 377 P.3d 339, 346 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2016). Rather, your request requires LVMPD to \u201ccompile information about the information [the database] contains.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). As such, your request requires the creation of a new record, which LVMPD has no duty to do under the Nevada Public Records Act. Public Employees Retirement System at 286.\r\n\r\nIn order to inspect or copy a public record, the specific record must be identified by the person requesting the record. Courts in addressing this issue have held that \u201cagencies are required to disclose only \u2018identifiable\u2019 governmental records not otherwise exempt.\u201d Hodai v. City of Tucson & Tucson Police Dep\u2019t, 2014 Ariz. Super. LEXIS 2158, *18 (Ariz. Super. Ct. 2014), quoting MAG Entertainment, LLC v. Division of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067, 1076 (N.J. Sup. Ct., App. Div. 2005). \u201cWholesale requests for general information to be analyzed, collated and compiled by the responding government entity are not encompassed therein.\u201d Id. A governmental agency is not required to respond to an overbroad request that does not request specific records. MAG Entertainment at 1074, citing Capitol Information Association v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985); cf. NAC 239.863(1)(c) (public records request must include a description of the public record that is sufficient to identify the record).\r\n\r\nIf you obtain any additional information that may assist in our recovery of records you seek, a new request may be submitted. As a courtesy we are providing following policies, that may be responsive to your request.  2.225 Internal Affairs Bureau, 8.330 Maintenance of Values and Ethics & 8.355 Purging of disciplinary files (please see attachments).\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Records Unit\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\r\n400-A South Martin L.
