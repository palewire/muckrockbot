        "communication": "I am writing to you with regard to my wrongful inclusion in a watchlist under the jurisdiction of the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC). I have reason to believe that I have been subjected to various forms of abuse, harassment, and exploitation as a result of this inclusion. This grievance pertains specifically to the actions of individuals within the Saint Louis Fusion Center, as well as its collaborative partners in State, Local, Tribal, Territorial Law Enforcement (F/SLTT), National Guard, Army, and Contractors. \r\n  \r\nIt has come to my attention that the Saint Louis Fusion Center, in conjunction with programs established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as the St. Louis Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), has engaged in practices that have violated established security protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and federal laws, notably the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.  \r\n  \r\nI have reason to believe that certain individuals associated with the operation have inappropriately disseminated my personal information for fraudulent purposes, potentially for personal gain, thereby compromising my privacy and potentially exposing me to unwarranted harm. These actions have not only caused me distress but have also raised serious concerns regarding the integrity and legality of the operations carried out by the Saint Louis Fusion Center and its affiliates.  Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the revelation that there are instances of misuse of telecommunications satellites and systems, which may pose a threat to security and integrity. I have reason to believe that these individuals have been using intelligence tactics to instill fear and create a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this operation, I have experienced instances of cruel and unusual punishment, including sexual misconduct, harassment, bodily injuries, discrimination, exploitation, mail tampering, and medical violations due to the arbitrary exercise of power. Furthermore, I have encountered Intelligence operators who have been involved in concealing, altering, and destroying evidence relevant to the situation. Additionally, these operators have intercepted telephone lines in an attempt to hinder me from reporting the illicit activities to government authorities and attorneys.\r\n  \r\nAs a law-abiding citizen, I expect that my rights and privacy are protected by those tasked with upholding the law. It is disheartening to discover that I have become a victim of misconduct and negligence within a system that is meant to safeguard the well-being of its citizens.  \r\n  \r\nI urge the Saint Louis Fusion Center to conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take the necessary steps to rectify any injustices that have been inflicted upon me. Furthermore, I request that appropriate measures be implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethical conduct within the organization.  \r\n  This letter serves as notice to the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC) to immediately cease and desist the following activities:\r\n1.)\tMisuse of collected data for personal gain.\r\n2.)\tMisuse of telecommunication and intelligence systems in order to harass, exploit, and deprive me of my constitutional rights. This includes ALL civil rights and liberties.\r\n3.)\tAny/All violations of the Standard Operating Systems (SOP).\r\n4.)\tAny/All fraud in relation to computers outlined specifically in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.\r\n5.)   Any/All unauthorized spying or monitoring that infringes on privacy rights.\r\n6.)   Impede and/or misrepresent communication or reporting with government entities and law firms.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Saint Louis Fusion Center will address this matter with the seriousness and urgency it deserves and provide me with a prompt response regarding the steps that will be taken to address my grievances.  \r\n  \r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.  \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins",

Wendy Mimiaga wmimiaga@cortezco.gov \r\n\r\n2. Mary Fuller. specifically turquoiseravenart@gmail.com\r\n\r\n3. Teri Paul. specifically from carpenter81321@protonmail.com and sundog2014@yahoo.com.\r\n\r\n4. All email discussions from Lance McDaniel to anyone or cc or bcc\r\n\r\n5. Any to, from, cc, bcc from domains a) state.co.us, b) cml.org, c) cfr.org, d) montezumainspire.org, e) nlc. org, f) united-way.swco.org... actually just include all *org email addresses and all *.co.us excluding co.montezuma.co.us.\r\n\r\n6. Matthew Keefauver. Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: \r\n\"Matthew Keefauver\" matthewkeefauver@netscape.net\r\n\"Matthew Keefauver\" matthewkeefauver@aim.com\r\n\"Matt Keefauver\" mkeefauver@cortez.k12.co.us\r\n\"'Matt Keefauver'\" matthewkeefauver@aol.com\r\n\r\n... or any other emails corresponding to this individual.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from October 1, 2023 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. Please provide each deliverable 1-5, or itemize and concatenate as per the request order for pricing and delivery.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. Please provide this metadata and note that no per-page fee should be levied.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPlease save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

In any case, please provide the records by electronic means only, not by post.\r\n\r\nIf you do not possess the record, or don't know whether it exists, please indicate what U.S. agencies are most likely to possess it, or determine whether it exists, for the purposes of FOIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Has the President issued any proclamation under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 441(a) with regard to the war?\r\n2. Are there any \"rules and regulations \u2026 prescribed\" under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 445(a) with regard to the war?\r\n3. What is the definition of \"American republic\" as used in 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 449?\r\n4. Had the President issued any proclamation under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 451 with regard to the war?\r\n5. Are there any \"rules and regulations\" \"promulgate[d]\" under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 453 with regard to the war?\r\n6. Are there any other U.S. laws (including regulations, statutes at large, etc) that prohibit such participation in the war? In particular, do the 1794 Neutrality Act, Neutrality Act of 1935, Neutrality Act of 1939, and/or 22 U.S. Code ch. 9 prohibit such participation?\r\n7. With regard to any such participation, has DoJ, or will DoJ,\r\n  a. pursue(d) charges under such laws? If yes in past tense, what are the 3 most recent such cases which are not sealed (in standard legal citation form, e.g. \"US v Smith, No. 23-cr-123 (X.D. State Y)\", or in the form of the CM/ECF stamped indictment, complaint, or equivalent)? If yes in future tense, under what conditions would such participation be charged or not (specific to the war or the participation, i.e. not including generic conditions applicable to all criminal charges like sufficiency of evidence)?\r\n  b. issue(d) a nolle prosequi or other express guarantee against such charges \u2014 or been aware of any such guarantee issued by a government entity other than DoJ (e.g. State Dept. or President) \u2014 either individual or general? If yes, what are its conditions (if any)?\r\n \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.

        "communication": "To New Orleans Police Department: \r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Louisiana Public Records Law. My name is Sarah Jones, and I am a resident of Louisiana. \r\n\r\nRequested Records\r\n\r\nI request all agency records from September 2014 to the present concerning Tweets deleted or drafted and not sent from the @NOPDNews account associated with the New Orleans Police Department. \r\n  \r\nI believe the records that I are located, inter alia, within agency headquarters, in email records, and in third-party platforms used to manage the Agency\u2019s social media accounts.\r\n\r\nThe records I request include, but are not limited to:\r\n1.\tRecords of all tweets deleted by the Twitter handle associated with the New Orleans Police Department (@NOPDNews), including:\r\n\r\na.\tAny tweets that were published on Twitter and subsequently deleted for any reason; and\r\n\r\nb.\tAny tweets published by other accounts that were retweeted by @NOPDNews and subsequently deleted for any reason.\r\n\r\n2.\tRecords of all tweets that have been kept in draft form beyond their expected date and time of publication, on Twitter or in a third-party social media management platform, for any reason. \r\n\r\n3.\tRecords related to the drafting or deletion of tweets, including:\r\n\r\na.\tAny correspondence or record of correspondence regarding the drafting or deletion of specific tweets\r\n\r\ni.\tincluding correspondence sent through official government email addresses or messaging services; and\r\n\r\nii.\tincluding correspondence sent through private third-party services such as Gmail or Slack; and\r\n\r\niii.\tIncluding any messages, notes, or annotations created on a third-party social media management platform.\r\n\r\nb.\tDocumentation of the agency\u2019s existing policy regarding the preservation and maintenance of tweets as per the Federal Records Act, and Federal Records Management Bulletin 2014-02 (available at https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2014/2014-02.htm), which stated that \u201csocial media content may be a Federal record when the use of social media provides added functionality, such as enhanced searchability, opportunities for public comment, or other collaboration\u2026 A complete Federal record must have content, context, and structure along with associated metadata (e.g., author, date of creation). The complete record must be maintained to ensure reliability and authenticity.\u201d\r\n\r\nc.\tAny briefings, reports, memoranda, legal opinions, policy statements, or talking points used or disseminated within the Agency regarding the drafting or deletion of tweets.\r\nI urge the NOPD to process this request consistent with \u201ca general philosophy of full agency disclosure [under FOIA] unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language,\u201d United States Dep't of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 494 (1994), and the Justice Department\u2019s policy directing a presumption of disclosure. See Dep\u2019t of Justice Office of Information Policy, President Obama\u2019s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder\u2019s FOIA Guidelines: Creating a \u201cNew Era of Open Government\u201d (2009), available at https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-creating-new-era-open-government). \r\n\r\nRequest for Public Interest Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest. It \u201cis likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the activities or operations of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nFirst, the records concern the operations or activities of the government. Government social media accounts are used to disseminated information to the public, make official pronouncements, and generally serve as an important touch point for governments to receive public input. See Social Media Use by Governments: A Policy Primer to Discuss Trends, Identify Policy Opportunities and Guide Decision Makers, OECD Working Papers on Public Governance, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxrcmghmk0s-en. Social media use, including tweets posted by @SocialSecurity and then deleted, or never posted, is an important part of this activity.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Specifically, the requested records will reveal substantial new information about how the New Orleans Police Department defines and manages tweets. They will allow the public to see what published messages have been rescinded and the process by which these public statements were retracted as compared to the processes employed by other agencies.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I respectfully request that the New Orleans Police Department grant a public interest fee waiver for this request, and that all fees related to the search, review, and duplication of the requested records be waived. If the fees will not be waived, I agree to pay up to $2 for the processing of this request. If the estimated fees will exceed this limit, please inform me before you begin processing.\r\n\r\nI request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format, if possible. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. \r\n\r\nSarah Jones",

        "communication": "To Louisiana State Police: \r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law, I am seeking access to records related to the law enforcement response at Tulane University during the protest and subsequent encampment between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. This protest was part of a wider movement related to the conflict in Gaza and has been noted for its significant impact on campus safety and public expression.\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\nDigital Documents:\r\n\r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest and the subsequent encampment that spread onto St. Charles Avenue\u2014which constitutes public property. \r\n\r\nLegal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. I am requesting body cam footage from all Louisiana State Police officers sent to Tulane University and the area between Jefferson Ave/St. Charles to Lowerline St./St. Charles Avenue between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest, the subsequent encampment, and the dissolving of the encampment between April 28, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\n\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest, the encampment, and the broader Tulane University between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\n\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\n\r\nPhysical Documents: Incident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest and in the aftermath of the encampment\u2019s dismantling between April 28, 2024 and May 11, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nOperational Plans: Documents issued between March 2020 and May 2024 detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing protests, including any internal documents or memoranda related to how to engage with protests involving New Orleans Police Department, Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, Tulane University Police, Tulane University students, and other Tulane community members. \r\n\r\nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\n\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression. The release of these records will enhance public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any potential fees associated with the processing of this request. I request a waiver of all fees as this disclosure is primarily in the public interest, contributing substantially to the understanding of government operations and is not for commercial purposes. I prefer to receive the documents electronically, via email or on a CD-ROM if electronic transfer is impractical.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Contact:\r\n\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe prescribed by law. Should you require any clarification or have questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt and thorough handling of this request, as dictated by applicable laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSarah Jones",

        "communication": "Dear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law, I am seeking access to records related to the law enforcement response at Tulane University during the protest and subsequent encampment between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. This protest was part of a wider movement related to the conflict in Gaza and has been noted for its significant impact on campus safety and public expression.\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\nDigital Documents:\r\n\r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest and the subsequent encampment that spread onto St. Charles Avenue\u2014which constitutes public property. \r\n\r\nLegal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. I am requesting body cam footage from all NOPD officers sent to Tulane University and the area between Jefferson Ave/St. Charles to Lowerline St./St. Charles Avenue between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest, the subsequent encampment, and the dissolving of the encampment between April 28, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\n\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest, the encampment, and the broader Tulane University between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\n\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\nPhysical Documents: Incident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest and in the aftermath of the encampment\u2019s dismantling between April 28, 2024 and May 11, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nOperational Plans: Documents issued between March 2020 and May 2024 detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing protests, including any internal documents or memoranda related to how to engage with protests involving Tulane University Police, Tulane University students, and other Tulane community members. \r\n\r\nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\n\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression. The release of these records will enhance public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\nPlease inform me of any potential fees associated with the processing of this request. I request a waiver of all fees as this disclosure is primarily in the public interest, contributing substantially to the understanding of government operations and is not for commercial purposes. I prefer to receive the documents electronically, via email or on a CD-ROM if electronic transfer is impractical.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Contact:\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe prescribed by law. Should you require any clarification or have questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt and thorough handling of this request, as dictated by applicable laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSarah Jones",

Please describe what incident occured. Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \r\n\r\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components.  Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions.  A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online:  https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information.  If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office.  Otherwise, respond back with your additional information. \r\n\r\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-HQFO-01446.  Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or at 202-343-1743. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office \r\nDepartment of Homeland Security \r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE \r\nMail Stop 0655 \r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655 \r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov \r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia",
