Stop-level records\r\n1.1)  All records that document vehicle or pedestrian stops that were initiated or materially influenced by an ALPR/Flock alert within the timeframe. This includes traffic stops where the plate or vehicle was flagged by a Flock camera.\r\n1.2)  For each stop, please provide, to the extent maintained:\r\n- Incident/case number; CAD event number\r\n- Date and start/end time of stop\r\n- Stop location (block-level or coordinates), patrol district/beat\r\n- Involved unit(s) and officer ID(s)\r\n- Stated legal basis/reason for stop\r\n- Whether the ALPR/Flock hit was the sole basis or a contributing factor\r\n- ALPR hit details: plate read, state, match reason/source (e.g., stolen vehicle, BOLO, warrant, expired registration), hit confidence, associated hotlist or BOLO identifier, camera ID and camera location, Flock event ID if available\r\n- Subject outcome(s): warning/citation(s) with statute codes, search conducted (yes/no; consent/probable cause), arrest(s) with charges, tow/impound, no action\r\n- Any officer narrative or disposition text\r\n- Demographic fields collected for stop data reporting, if maintained (e.g., perceived race/ethnicity, age, gender), recognizing personal identifiers may be redacted\r\n- Use-of-force indicator if tracked at stop level\r\n1.3) If such fields do not exist, please state so.\r\n1.4) Preferred format: CSV or Excel for tabular fields; PDFs for narratives; please include a data dictionary/code sheets for field names and values.\r\n\r\n2) CAD/RMS queries and reports\r\n2.1) Any standard or ad hoc CAD/RMS reports that list stops associated with ALPR/Flock hits (e.g., nature/type codes \u201cALPR,\u201d \u201cFLOCK,\u201d \u201cLPR,\u201d or similar), for the timeframe.\r\n2.2) If a flag/field exists in CAD/RMS linking a stop to an ALPR hit, please export all records with that field populated for the timeframe.\r\n2.3) If such fields do not exist, please state so.\r\n\r\n3) Flock Safety logs tied to stops\r\n3.1) Flock \u201cHit\u201d or \u201cAlert\u201d logs for the timeframe that resulted in officer action or a stop, including: timestamp, camera ID/location, plate read, associated hotlist entry, hit confidence, responding unit/officer (if recorded), acknowledgement/dispatch notes, event ID.\r\n3.2) Any exports or audit logs that show user access or queries directly associated with the above stops.\r\n3.3) Preferred format: CSV/Excel.\r\n\r\n4) Metadata and codebooks\r\n4.1) Data dictionaries, schemas, and code sheets for relevant CAD/RMS tables/fields used to record stop reasons, dispositions, ALPR associations, and Flock event identifiers.\r\n\r\n5) If records are not tracked:\r\n5.1) If EPD does not track whether a stop was initiated or influenced by an ALPR/Flock hit, please provide:\r\n5.1.1) A written explanation of how such stops could be identified, if at all;\r\n5.1.2) The names of any fields, codes, or report names you considered; and\r\n5.1.3) The specific database systems searched (e.g., CAD, RMS, Flock portal) and the search queries used.\r\n\r\nIf the above is burdensome, please first produce:\r\n- A stop-level dataset limited to the most recent 30 days; or\r\n- A monthly aggregate count of ALPR/Flock-initiated stops and outcomes for the full timeframe.\r\n\r\nPreferred Format: \r\n- Please provide records electronically via email or secure download. \r\n- Data tables in CSV/Excel preferred\r\n- Documents in searchable PDF.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of ALPR-driven enforcement and public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and intend to make the results publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf you withhold or redact any portion, please produce all segregable nonexempt material and cite the specific statutory basis for each redaction or withholding.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you have questions\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSeth May",

The package, addressed personally and marked \u201curgent\u201d without a return address, triggered alarm at the office and ultimately led Poloncarz to adopt an armed security detail. The sibling duo\u2014Christina Little and Kevin Riford\u2014say the envelope contained extensive documentation concerning a contentious custody dispute and allegations of judicial corruption in Niagara County. They hoped Poloncarz would either take action or forward their concerns to Governor Cuomo. After passing routine security screening, the package was delivered to a receptionist on the 16th floor of the Rath Building, along with similar documents sent to local media outlets.  Shortly afterward, a sheriff\u2019s investigator visited Christina\u2019s home seeking Kevin. The siblings were confused by the level of concern raised over what appeared to them to be harmless legal documents. Poloncarz later confirmed the package played a part in increasing security measures, though he did not personally read the contents\u2014his staff reviewed it after authorities cleared it as non-dangerous\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

those are records that are not legally privileged. \r\n\r\nPlease also note that the publication of https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/14/2025-15490/notice-of-the-department-of-energy-freedom-of-information-act-foia-still-interested-inquiry makes both items 2 & 3 post-decisional, and that they include \"facts\", which are exempt from deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction format \r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content, please assign a replacement identifier for each different piece of content redacted, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the DoE has incorporated these records, by reference, in a Federal Register publication, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/14/2025-15490/notice-of-the-department-of-energy-freedom-of-information-act-foia-still-interested-inquiry; \r\n* these records would inform the public about a novel attempt to cancel FOIA requests in bulk; and\r\n* these records would better enable responses to the DoE's Federal Register publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Expedition\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing, to be completed in no longer than 2 weeks, because these records are critical to \r\na. informing responses to the DoE's Federal Register publication, which demands a response by September 18, 2025, and\r\nb. informing timely journalistic coverage of that publication and its likely impact.\r\n\r\nI also note that all records requested by item 1 should be already held by the DoE HQ FOIA office itself, making it especially easy to quicky provide.\r\n\r\nPlease pay particular attention to the \"rolling updates\" request above. In order to maximally expedite this request, please provide every record (or part of record) requested as soon as you are able, on the same day as that particular record can be provided, without waiting for any remaining records requested, even if that makes the records fragmented, or makes any particular update incomplete. This includes, for example, providing CSV formatted spreadsheets in response to item 1 which cover only some of the sub-items (if for instance some of them can be more quickly provided than others). However, please ensure that every spreadsheet provided in response to item 1 includes at least 1 uniquely identifying field-set which is the same across all spreadsheets, so that partial responses can be easily combined to form a single updated spreadsheet. (Alternatively and preferably, provide successively updated spreadsheets with all information available so far, rather than just the unique identifiers and the newly available column(s).)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires for expedited requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

To quote:\r\n\r\n> I'm working on FOIA request NLRB-2023-001998 for \"all non-exempt fields of the participant and participant_party tables from the NxGen case management system database.\"\r\n> \r\n> NxGen designates participants to have one of four roles:\r\n> \r\n> * Primary: This is usually the main address of the facility as designated on the charge or petition\r\n> * Legal Rep: Legal representation for the primary participant\r\n> * Additional Service: These are people who would be like a cc in letters, or it could be a secondary address for someone. For example: many union reps list their official business address as primary, and because they might be located in a remote area or working from home, they have a secondary address or home address listed as an additional service.\r\n> * Notification: This are the national or international union headquarters. To become a notification, the organization has to file Form 4702 annually, and the notification party only receives a copy of the charge or petition.\r\n> \r\n> Participants also have distinct roles: Employer, Union, Individual, and Union as an Employer.\r\n> \r\n> NxGen further designates participants as: Charging Party, Charged Party/Respondent, Involved Party, Petitioner, Intervenor, Employer, and Amicus.\r\n> \r\n> Instead of providing a dump of all the participants in the system, and in order to provide the most relevant case information, my recommendation for participants is to provide the Primary participant information (entity name and address) and exclude the Legal Reps, Additional Services, and Notifications. Also, because the participant tables do not contain any other case-specific information besides the case number, I would recommend including the case name, date filed, date closed, and case closing reason. I also recommend information for individual charging parties/petitioners be listed simply as the party type of \"Individual\" and to exclude individuals' personal address information from your request (we would withheld it per Exemptions 6 and 7(C) if it's not specifically excluded.) Further, I would also recommend excluding Amicus information since cases can only have Amicus filings if the Board approves it.\r\n> \r\n> Sample R case info:\r\n> Case Number\r\n> Case Name\r\n> Case Filed Date\r\n> Case Closed Date\r\n> Closed Reason\r\n> Dispute/Unit State\r\n> Dispute/Unit City\r\n> Employer Type\r\n> Employer Account Name\r\n> Employer Address1\r\n> Employer Address Address2\r\n> Employer Address City\r\n> Employer Address State\r\n> Employer Address Zipcode\r\n> Petitioner Party Type\r\n> Petitioner\r\n> Petitioner Address1\r\n> Petitioner Address2\r\n> Petitioner Address City\r\n> Petitioner Address State\r\n> Petitioner Address Zipcode\r\n> Union Involved Party Type\r\n> Union Involved\r\n> Union Involved Address1\r\n> Union Involved Address2\r\n> Union Involved City\r\n> Union Involved State\r\n> Union Involved Zipcode\r\n> 09-RC-324532\r\n> Dunkin' Donuts\r\n> 08/25/2023\r\n> \r\n> OH\r\n> Cincinnati\r\n> Employer\r\n> Dunkin' Donuts\r\n> 850 Eastgate North Drive\r\n> \r\n> Cincinnati\r\n> OH\r\n> 45245\r\n> Union\r\n> Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, Local 57, AFL-CIO, CLC\r\n> 871 West Marion Road, Suite 202\r\n> \r\n> Mt.
