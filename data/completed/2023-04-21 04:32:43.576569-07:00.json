Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

CORRECTED REQUEST IS AS FOLLOWS:\r\n\r\nKENT SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nThe district responded January 3, 2023 once we reopened after the holiday the break. However, the email sent to another mail box within your agency as we have multiple requests for the same thing just different schools years.\r\n\r\nBased on the information provided, the estimated preliminary cost is $87.50 with a 10% deposit of $8.75.\r\n\r\nThe attached form will direct you to Kent School District's online payment account system. Once you make your deposit, you will receive a receipt for the payment and the district will begin processing request. Your Public Records number is 22-23-63\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the district, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to narrow your scope or provide additional information to help reduce the amount, please let us know.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D921CE.4F205980]<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\nTyler Inboden (She/Her)\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nSuperintendent\u2019s Office | Kent School District<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\n12033 SE 256th Street, A-100, Kent, WA 98030-6503\r\nO: (253) 373-7218 | Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us<mailto:Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us>\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

The Sherriff\u2019s Office provided me with the incident number 2107220284/case number 21015344 and incident number 2301220136/case number 23001556. If you have any additional case numbers or information, let me know.\r\n\r\nFirst we have to see from the law enforcement agency if we are authorized to release the audio. If we are authorized to release it, we will have your request done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by Florida State Statute Section 365.171(12)(a) and 401.30 to redact certain information from 911 calls. Section 365.171(12)(a), F.S., provides that any record, recording, or information, or portions thereof, obtained by a public agency for the purpose of providing services in an emergency which reveals the name, address, or telephone number or personal information about, or information which may identify any person requesting emergency service or reporting an emergency by accessing an emergency communications E911 system is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), F.S.  Additionally, under 401.30, records of emergency calls which contain patient examination or treatment information are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and may not be disclosed without the consent of the person to whom they pertain, but appropriate limited disclosure may be made without such consent to the person\u2019s guardian, to the next of kin if the person is deceased, or to a parent if the person is a minor.\r\n\r\nOnce your request is complete, we could email over an invoice. You could be charged for labor at a rate of $29.94 an hour if the request takes longer than 30 minutes to pull the audio. We will let you know if it reaches that point. As long as the audio is redacted, the audio file is small enough to be attached to an email and there isn't a labor charge we must receive payment for first, we can send it over email as soon as your request is complete, free of charge. If you prefer the audio be burnt onto a CD, the cost will be $0.30 for the CD and $1.76 for postage if mailed. We accept cash and checks.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa\n",

Metro Police Second District (2D) created from the beginning of May 31st, 2020 to end of June 1st, 2020.\r\n\r\nAfter due consideration, your request has been granted in part and denied in part.  The names and Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) numbers of all involved officers and officials below the rank of Inspector, the Central Complaint Number (CCN), and other identifying information have been redacted from the two attached PD Forms 901-m under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534(a)(2) and (a)(3)(C) to prevent the unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of these officers and officials.\r\n\r\nPlease know that under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this response to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> .Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in this matter.\r\n\r\nTeresa Quon Hyden\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n441 Fourth Street, NW\r\n11th Floor South\r\nWashington, DC 20001",

You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: \r\nPublic Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 Fax: 217-782-1396 E-mail: publicaccess@atg.state.il.us You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11.

I have\r\npreviously\r\nwritten about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n100,000\r\nreaders in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\nPeople,\r\nUnicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\nexpectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\nestablished. In\r\naddition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\nthrough\r\nnon-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\nnon-profit MuckRock,\r\ndisseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\nthis, a great\r\ndeal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\ngovernment itself.\r\nAs such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\nparticular\r\nsubject in advance.\r\nFurther, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\nreleased information\r\nto a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\nInc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\nJustice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\nJustice, 19 F.\r\n3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\nbecause it also\r\nhad \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d\r\nconcerning United States\r\nforeign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\nqualify as a member of\r\nthe news media.\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\nnature of the\r\nrequester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be\r\n\u201cmade by\u201d a\r\nrepresentative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\nreporter, for\r\nexample, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\ninterest there is\r\nin the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\ndetails of the\r\nrequest itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\ncategory.\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\non it and\r\nmaking the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\nPlease select and describe in detail if you believe your request warrants\r\nexpeditious handling:\r\nPlease provide information to support your selection:\n",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, job title code, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service or classification status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI see that RI makes many of these data available here: http://www.transparency.ri.gov/payroll/. If my request above cannot be filled, I would like to request at minimum a copy of the data available on the transparency site with a variable that denotes whether an employee is in the classified, unclassified, or non-classified service. \r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, job title code, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service or classification status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI see that RI makes many of these data available here:\u00a0http://www.transparency.ri.gov/payroll/. If my request above cannot be filled, I would like to request at minimum a copy of the data available on the transparency site with a variable that denotes whether an employee is in the classified, unclassified, or non-classified service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request is governed by the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act (\u201cAPRA\u201d) contained in R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-1\u00a0et seq.\u00a0This response is solely on behalf of the Department and not any other agency or branch of government.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to age, race, gender of specific individuals, this information is exempt from disclosure.\u00a0Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-2(4)(A)(I)(b), the age, race and gender of specific state employees are not expressly defined as \u201cpublic\u201d in APRA. Therefore, in accordance with this statutory provision, the Department must determine whether disclosing this employee information tied to specific individuals \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d After consideration and balancing the interests of government transparency, the Department believes that disclosing the self-identified race, age and gender of a specific, individually named employees would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and these individuals may not want this information disclosed for personal reasons. Furthermore, disclosing this information tied to specific individuals could place these individuals at risk of identity theft and phishing attacks.\u00a0Thus, the information is exempt from disclosure.\u00a0However, in the interests of transparency, with this response, the Department is providing aggregate, de-identified information with respect to race, ethnicity, and gender for each agency.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to go back in time and create a monthly report based on past information, the Department estimates it will take approximately 4 hours for every month to pull tape and recreate the list of employees at that point in time. Therefore, based on 42 months, it will take 168 hours at a rate of $15.00 per hour making a total of $2505.00. (Note: The first hour of search and retrieval in response to an APRA request is free, and the Department may charge $15.00 per hour thereafter.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, If the Department runs the report quarterly, it will be 14 quarters at 4 hours for each quarter for a total of $825.00.\u00a0(Note: The first hour of search and retrieval in response to an APRA request is free, and the Department may charge $15.00 per hour thereafter.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, without going back in time, the Department is able to provide a spreadsheet of current employees with the following columns name, title, department, annual salary, classified/unclassified/non-classified status at no charge.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-4(b) and 220-RICR-50-05-1.6(B) of the Department\u2019s APRA Regulations, the first hour of search and retrieval in response to an APRA request is free, and the Department may charge $15.00 per hour thereafter. The Department has provided estimates for both monthly and quarterly reports. Therefore, the estimated cost must be prepaid before the Department proceeds with your request as follows:\u00a0Please make check or money order for prepayment payable to \u201cRhode Island General Fund\u201d and send or deliver the payment to the attention of Division of Legal Services, One Capitol Hill, 4th Floor, Providence, RI 02908, with specific reference to your request.\u00a0Please note time will be tolled under APRA until payment is made. Additionally, without waiving any exemptions under APRA, once payment is received, the Department would require additional time (up to 20 additional business days) in accordance with \u00a7\u00a038-2-3(e), to complete the above-mentioned reports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, please indicate whether you wish only to receive a report with current employees. If we do not hear from you regarding prepayment after 30 days, we will consider this request closed, but you may resubmit at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to appeal any portion of this response, you may do so in accordance with the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-8 to the Chief Administrative Officer at the Department (Director, Department of Administration, One Capitol Hill, 4th Floor, Providence, Rhode Island 02908), to the Rhode Island Attorney General, or in the Superior Court through judicial action.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at RI Department of Administration.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

Specifically, on page A-2 (page 20 in the PDF) of the document found at the following link: https://emma.msrb.org/P11520405.pdf\r\n\r\nGiven this information, I kindly request that you reconsider and reevaluate my original FOIL request for the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Live Birth Data including constant birth rate, long term, short term, and average birth rates for within the district for the current and previous six years.\r\n2. Birth to Kindergarten Survival Ratio used for the past ten years by year.\r\n3. Projected Kindergarten Enrollment for the past ten years by year, and supporting data.\r\n4. Any communications with NYS DOH or County DOH or other data service provider requesting, receiving, or inquiring regarding live birth data, birth to kindergarten survival rate, or other statistical data used for projecting enrollment.\r\n5. Copies of all enrollment projections for the past six years and source statistical data, including but not limited to live birth data which were used to provide projected enrollment data upon which securities purchasers rely.\r\n\r\nIf the District does not maintain these specific records, I kindly request that you provide any alternative records or information that may help fulfill my request, such as the departments or agencies that might maintain such records.",

I have been producing, on behalf of the District, public records request logs, which are \u201celectronic cop[ies]\u201d of \u201cPublic Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d I understood the logs to be directly responsive to the first part of your request.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  If you do not believe public records request logs are responsive to your request, please clarify your request to explain what records you intended to request by seeking \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d\r\n  2.  As you likely know, Washington law does not require agencies to retain records relating to public requests records beyond two years after the request is closed. The Local Government Common Records Retention Schedule, section 5.4, sets forth records that may be destroyed after two years, which \u201c[i]ncludes but is not limited to:\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInternal and external correspondence relating to the request;\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records provided to the requestor (copies or lists of the records provided, etc.);\u201d and\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records (or portions) withheld (exemption logs, copies of portions redacted, etc.).\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, many such records relating to requests closed more than 2 years prior to the date of your request no longer exist. That is also why I was producing request logs to you. For many of the older requests, the request logs may be the only existing records. Do you no longer want to receive request logs, even if they may be the only existing records potentially responsive to your request with respect to requests closed more than two years prior to the date of your request?\r\n\r\n  1.  I was also producing request logs to give you an opportunity to identify particular requests that were of interest to you, so searches for records relating to those requests could be prioritized. Is that an opportunity that is of interest to you?\r\n\r\nYour answers to these clarification questions are due within 30 days, that is, on or before August 12. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s next response. The District will not proceed with the next installment scheduled for July 20, pending receipt of your answers, so that the District\u2019s responses can reflect an accurate understanding of what you are requesting. If you do not answer within 30 days, your request may be closed.\r\n\r\nThe District is under no obligation to produce records to you in a reverse chronological order. Records will be produced in a manner that reflects the most efficient method of assembling and reviewing potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Therefore, appended hereto please find:\r\n\r\n2019 Log\r\n\r\nThis record contains information that is exempt under the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56.RCW. Redactions made pursuant to the Act are marked with an overlying code. I have also attached a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that provides an explanation of the basis for the exemptions applied. If no code is applied or if a code is partially visible, the applicable codes are 1A, 10A.\r\n\r\nI regret that it was not possible to make an installment of records to you on the previously estimated date of August 3, 2022. The factors affecting the extension of that date included staff absences due to illness and vacation break, and ongoing workload in this department.\r\nAs I indicated to you in response to your request PRR 11022021-Anon, the District is not withholding any records from you and has nothing to hide.\r\nPlease direct all messages pertaining to your request to the public records mailbox, publicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>.\r\nThe automated correspondence features of the Muckrock site are not an efficient way to correspond or to review correspondence. Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string, or by excerpting them in any way. I know that the correspondence history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that a complete and accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nI estimate a next installment to your request will be made on or before September 26, 2022. Estimated dates are subject to change. The timing of this estimate is based on anticipated staff absences, operational responsibilities related to school reopening, and the workload in this department.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Copies of file numbers:\r\n    \r\n    * 62-46855\r\n    * 62-116659\r\n    * 75-238\r\n    * 100-151646\r\n    * 100-391697\r\n    * 100-445578\r\n    * 140-26813\r\n    * 161-9153\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The Office of the Governor has constructively denied my request. The possible return date of 5/1/23 \u2014 nearly 3 months after the request was filed \u2013 is unreasonable, given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, the Office of the Governor is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be filled, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond twenty business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]).  In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI, on behalf of New York Focus, am requesting either you fill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSam Mellins\r\nSenior Reporter, New York Focus",

We received\r\nyour request on October 31, 2022. Please use the above request ID number when contacting us\r\nabout this request.\r\n\r\nYou asked for a copy of the Personal Storage Table (.pst) file for Traci Yerbich, email account\r\ntraci.yerbich@dshs.wa.gov for the time period January 1, 2022 \u2013 October 28, 2023 in Native\r\nFormat.\r\n\r\nPlease note, we understand this request includes records created on or before October 31, 2022 (date\r\nrequest was received) and does not include records that may be created in the future. Under RCW\r\n42.56.080(1), a public records request must be for an existing identifiable record. Requests cannot\r\nbe \u201cstanding\u201d requests for records that may be available in the future (Sargent v. Seattle Police\r\nDept. 2011). If you wish to receive records related to the above subjects that may be created during\r\nthe next year (November 1, 2022 \u2013 October 28, 2023), you will need to make a new request at a\r\nfuture date.\r\n\r\nYou have asked to receive records in native .pst format. We will make every effort to comply with\r\nthis request when native format is available. Please note, if records require the redaction of exempt\r\ninformation we only have the ability to provide them in PDF format. Please note: emails in the .pst\r\nfile may contain the following:\r\n\r\nRecords that include/contain individual DSHS Client information will be redacted and/or\r\nwithheld as those records would be confidential and privileged under RCW 74.04.060, and\r\nother state and federal laws that govern DSHS programs. Records related to DCS are also\r\nprivate and confidential under RCW 26.23.120. We must have a valid authorization or\r\ncourt order to allow us to give you client records held by DSHS.\r\n\r\nResponsive records may include thousands of all-staff emails, meeting notices, calendar\r\nappointments, distribution list emails with multiple recipients, and other emails received by this\r\nemployee during the course of their normal job duties. Additionally, responsive records may also\r\ninclude thousands of emails that contain large spreadsheets/lists of employees or clients that will\r\nrequire extensive review and, when converted for review for potential redactions, each spreadsheet\r\nmay be hundreds of pages in length. Do you wish to receive these types of records?\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive clarification from you within two weeks, or by November 21, 2022, we will\r\nunderstand you are seeking the records noted above and will process your request accordingly.\r\nRecords located in response to your request will likely include lists of individuals. RCW\r\n42.56.070(8) prohibits agencies from providing access to lists of individuals when requested for a\r\ncommercial purpose. If you wish to receive lists of individuals, we require completion of the\r\nenclosed declaration form certifying that you are not making this public records request for\r\ncommercial purposes. Without completion of this form lists of individuals will be redacted or\r\nwithheld under RCW 42.56.070(8).\r\n\r\nWe will send your request to the DSHS programs that may hold responsive records.

The response I received indicated that the requested records are too broad, that some requests ask the agency to create documents, and that the requested records may be produced by other New York State agencies. Additionally, the response stated that some of the requested records are interagency communications.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that other New York State agencies may have similar data, I believe that your agency is in the best position to provide the specific records I have requested. As I stated in my initial request, I am seeking access to all Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022. These records are critical to understanding how public school districts are implementing the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law in relation to instruction on the Holocaust. Without these records, it is impossible to assess whether these standards are being met and whether the public is being adequately informed about this critical topic.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe that the requested records are not too broad, as they are narrowly focused on a specific survey and date range. As such, I do not believe that my request requires the creation of new records, as the requested records should already exist in your agency's possession.\r\n\r\nI would like to request a written explanation of any exemptions or reasons for denial of access, as required under FOIL. I believe that any applicable exemptions should be narrowly construed in accordance with the law, and that the public interest in disclosure outweighs any privacy or confidentiality concerns that may exist.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in government, and the critical role that FOIL plays in promoting these values. The requested records are essential to ensuring that the New York State Education Department is fulfilling its obligations under the law, and I believe that they should be made available to the public.\r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, I respectfully request that you reconsider your denial of my request for access to the requested records. If you require any additional information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was assigned Department of the Interior (DOI) tracking number DOI-NPS-2023-003563. Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested:\r\n\r\n\u201cReports and/or case incidents relating to homicides taking place at Death Valley National Park from January 2020 onwards.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were two homicides in Death Valley National Park during the time period you specify. The press releases related to each of them are available at:\r\n\r\n  *   Fatalities 01-13-2023 - Death Valley National Park <https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/news/fatalities-01-13-2023.htm>\r\n  *   Fatality 2020-10-11 - Death Valley National Park <https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/news/fatality-2020-10-11.htm>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may be interested in contacting the Inyo County Sheriff\u2019s Department as they are the lead agency with jurisdiction over homicide cases in those portions of Death Valley National Park. The NPS\u2019s role was as support to the Inyo County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\r\n\r\nMultitrack Processing\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests. The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process. The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process. The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process. The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process. The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable. Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track. There are four requests in the Normal processing track and 20 requests in the Complex processing track pending ahead of your request. Because we will need to search for and collect requested records from field facilities or other units that are separate from the office processing the request, we are taking a 10-workday extension under 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.19<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/subtitle-A/part-2#2.19>. We therefore expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by May 8, 2023.\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently-assigned track or move the request into a different track (which may have the effect of reducing the cost of processing your request and having it processed more quickly). If you have any questions about this, please contact us.\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media. As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.39<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/subtitle-A/part-2#2.39>. If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.37(g).<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/subtitle-A/part-2#2.37>\r\n\r\nYou have agreed to pay up to $200 for the processing of your request. If we find that this will not cover the cost of processing your request, we will stop processing your request at the point this amount has been reached and will let you know before we incur additional charges. You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, please contact me directly at abby_wines@nps.gov or 760-786-3221.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n /s/ Abigail Wines\r\n\r\nAbby Wines\r\nManagement Analyst\r\n\r\nCc:       Regional FOIA Office, National Park Service Interior Regions 8, 9, 10, 12",

We received your email requesting clarification\r\nabout our methodology in responding to your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we detailed to you in a previous communication, many of our public\r\nrecords requests concern students and staff. We have approximately 136\r\npublic records requests that are responsive to your request that require 3rd\r\nparty notification related to hundreds of people.\r\n                                           2020-2021- 28 requests require 3\r\nrd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2018-2019 \u2013 13\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2012-2017 \u2013 95\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7       With our last installment, we have provided to you, in reverse\r\nchronological order, all requests for records covering 2012-2021 that do\r\nnot require 3rd party notification.  Next we will be providing non-exempt\r\nrecords responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\u00b7       After those installments, we will move on to the requests that\r\nrequire 3rd party notification, allowing time for affected parties to seek\r\ninjunctions if they so choose.  Absent injunctions, we will then provide\r\nnon-exempt records responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our responsive records are available electronically, but many from\r\n2012 \u2013 2017 are in paper form and will need to be scanned into PDFs.\r\nEmails are printed and then scanned to PDF for production.  We are making\r\nsteady progress in fulfilling your request but are unable to give an exact\r\ndate when the request will be completed in full.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiana S.
