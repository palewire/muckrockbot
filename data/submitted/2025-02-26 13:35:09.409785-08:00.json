A copy of the September 2024 NFLIS-Drug bulletin that mentions Deoxmethoxetamine should be attached to this request. \r\n\r\nThis is a request for any documents, reports, memorandum, or anything that could reasonably be construed as \"relevant documents\" related to Deoxmethoxetamine created by the NFLIS during this period. Please conduct a search any \"evaluations for scheduling\" or \"recommendations for scheduling\" or \"reports to NFLIS\" or \"reports from NFLIS\" regarding Deoxymethoxetamine aka \"3'-methyl-2-oxo-PCE\", \"DMXE\" and \"3D-MXE\".\r\n\r\nIf the Drug Enforcement Agency cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the Drug Enforcement Agency's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together until this request is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
