Kent, known as \"Norm Kent\" help found the South Florida Gay News publication. Kent was also an attorney and political activist. Kent was leader of the marijuana rights organization NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and provided legal representation to individual prosecuted on marijuana possession charges. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not needed as Norman Kent's death was widely reported in the media.  A copy of his obituary should be attached. Here's a link to an extensive news report on this death:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonblade.com/2023/04/13/norm-kent-co-founder-of-south-florida-gay-news-dies-at-73/\r\n\r\nOf particular interest would be bureau monitoring of Kent's writings in the Express Gay News or South Florida Gay News publications, as well as any records related to Kent's radio program. Other possible records might include Kent's legal representation of talk radio personality Neil Rogers. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Norman Elliott Kent. \r\n\r\nPlease include a survey of records at the Miami field office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Norman Elliott Kent.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's dedication to transparency, and I look forward to working as long as it takes to have any records, should they exist, be released.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
