        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

        "communication": "Dear Cecelia,\r\n\r\nApologies for the confusion- the request should have said \"department\" rather than \"police department\". Please see below for the corrected request. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

No explanation was given for why the records I requested could not be produced, as is dictated by the MTA\u2019s legal obligations under the New York Freedom of Information Law. Consequently I consider the request to have been denied and I\u2019m appealing on that basis.\r\n\r\nMy FOIL request asked for the following records:\r\n- Copies of all rider comments collected by the Metropolitan Transit Authority pertaining to the Queens Bus Network Redesign, submitted electronically via the project web page at the following URLs:\r\nhttps://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus (This was the original Queens Bus Network Redesign comment page which was later replaced with the URL below)\r\nhttps://contact.mta.info/s/forms/bus-network-redesign\r\n- I limited my request to comments submitted between March 29, 2022 and August 31, 2022\r\n- In the interest of complying with the Freedom of Information Law\u2019s privacy requirements, I asked to limit the request to the \u201ccomment\u201d text only, withholding entries for name, address & contact information. As the data was collected via electronic web form with separate entry fields, it\u2019s possible to extract the \"comment\" text by means of existing computer programs.\r\n- I requested raw data in machine-readable form, such as a CSV or Excel file.\r\n- I explained that the documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n- In the event that there were fees, I asked to be informed of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n- I specified a preference that the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nIn response to my request, the MTA sent me the attached document (03398573-Responsive Record).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there is no legal basis for the MTA to deny my request. The records I requested were collected by the MTA via its own website, presumably stored on the agency\u2019s own computer systems, allowing for redaction of personal information to comply with privacy requirements. Please refer to the attached  Committee on Open Government advisory opinion letter (FOIL-AO-19157). It can also be viewed online at: https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19157.html. \r\n\r\nI've pasted relevant quotes from the attached advisory opinion letter below:\r\n\r\n\"if information is maintained in some physical form, it would constitute a \"record\" subject to rights of access conferred by the Law [Babigian v. Evans, 427 NYS 2d 688, 691 (1980); aff'd 97 AD 2d 992 (1983); see also, Szikszay v.

Please refer to these two FOIL requests for electronic records submitted online.\r\n\r\n- MTA FOIL Request #17695 submitted by J.K. Trotter via Muckrrock on December 3, 2013. This request asks the MTA to extract \u201cComments\u201d and claims text entries for lost or stolen Metrocards submitted to the Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019s Balance Protection Program MetroCard eFix website:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/mta-balanceprotection-comments-9399/\r\n\r\n- MTA FOIL Request #00066415 submitted by J.K. Trotter via Muckrock on May 31, 2016. This request asks to extract demographic data submitted via the MTA\u2019s online surveys while redacting any personal data to comply with privacy requirements.\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/responses-to-mta-surveys-25929/\r\n\r\nAs required by the Freedom of Information Law, the head or governing body of an agency, or whomever is designated to determine appeals, is required to respond within 10 business days of the receipt of an appeal. If the records are denied on appeal, please explain the reasons for the denial fully in writing as required by law.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please be advised that the Freedom of Information Law directs agencies to send all appeals and the determinations that follow to the Committee on Open Government, Department of State, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Ave., Albany, New York 12231.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDouglas Breitbart",

        "communication": "1. On 9/11/2023 I made a request for \u201c\u2026all records related to the home loans in disaster areas FY 2019 risk assessment conducted by the Department of Veteran's Affairs Loan Guaranty Monitoring Unit. For reference, this risk assessment is mentioned in passing on page 18 of Veteran Affairs OIG REPORT #18-03979-204. Per the report, \"In July 2019, the quality assurance chief informed the audit team a preliminary \r\nrisk analysis had been conducted and that analysis did not necessitate a formal risk assessment of the disaster loans area.\" I am also requesting all e-mail or internal electronic communications from the applicable \"quality assurance chief\" related to the 2019 risk assessment concerning home loans in disaster areas.\u201d\r\n\r\n2. On 9/11/2023 I received an intake letter from the applicable VA FOIA office in response to said request.\r\n\r\n3. On 9/12/2023 I received an acknowledgement letter from the applicable VA FOIA office in response to said request.\r\n\r\n4. On 9/15/2023 I received fee estimate and invoice letters from the applicable VA FOIA office in response to said request. \r\n\r\n5. None of the documents provided by the VA in response to the request complied with the request requirements as required by the applicable statute and litigated in Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nhttps://casetext.com/case/citizens-for-responsibility-ethics-in-wash-v-fed-election-commn\r\n\r\n6. A good summation of Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n as it applies to the present situation is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201c Individuals seeking records under the federal Freedom of Information Act can immediately sue agencies that miss the statute's deadlines for properly responding to a request, a federal appeals court reaffirmed Tuesday.\r\n\r\nIn a victory for records requestors, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. sided with the government accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), unanimously ruling that if government agencies do not tell requestors whether they will fulfill the request within 20 days, requestors may sue the agency immediately without filing an administrative appeal.\r\n\r\nFederal agencies recently began arguing that acknowledging that the request had been received was sufficient, which meant that a requestor had to go through the appeals process before filing a lawsuit.\r\n\r\nThe case, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election Commission, put to rest the question of whether federal agencies could satisfy FOIA\u2019s 20-day response deadline by simply acknowledging the request and not detailing what documents would or wouldn\u2019t be handed over and why.\u201d\r\n\r\n7. The documents provided in response to the request by the applicable VA FOIA office do not state whether the request will or will not be fulfilled. \r\n\r\n8. Additionally, Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n determined that a response failing to state whether a request would or would not be fulfilled was no response at all.\r\n\r\n9. At most, an agency has 30 business days from the date of a request to provide a response to a noncommercial requestor (such as myself) before that agency loses the ability to charge search fees. \r\n\r\n10. It has been 40 business days since 9/11/2023. \r\n\r\nIn short, I don\u2019t have to wait for the administrative process to play out to sue for the requested records and I don\u2019t have to pay any fees for the requested records.

Records/documents that describe and detail the policies and procedures surrounding reasonable suspicion subject an employee to drug testing per Florida's Drug-Free Workplace Act (F.S.112.0455).\r\n\r\n2.

Records/documents that relate to employer abuse of F.S. 112.0455, including but not limited to making false or fictitious statements to Florida Department of Regulations Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, and the consequences of an employer abusing the aforementioned Florida Statute.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to employer consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions when intentionally abusing or defrauding the Florida Department of Financial Services per F.S. 112.0455  (as an example, by trick or deceit, lack of reasonable suspicion, making materially false or fictitious statements).\r\n\r\n5. Records/documents relating to if/when/how the fourth amendment applies as it relates to private employers (ie, nongovernmental employers) subjecting employees to reasonable suspicion drug testing and if such cases are known to Florida Department of Financial Services.\r\n\r\n6. Records/documents relating to a private employer in which such employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the government, or under the direction of the government within the context of reasonable suspicion testing.\r\n\r\n7. Records/documents relating to if or in what manner an employer\u2019s policies can extend beyond the scope of the F.S. 112.0455 and the Florida Department of Financial Services\u2019 guidelines (if such records exist).\r\n\r\n8. Records relating to persons who can formally assess an employee within a hospital setting under the pretense of reasonable suspicion testing. Additionally, the qualifications, credentials, licensure, or training that such persons must have.\r\n\r\n9.

What sections of F.S. 112.0455, if any, an employer need or must adhere to if a private employer voluntarily chooses not to comply with the stated Florida Statue.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Depending on the time frame for the request to be fulfilled and any fees that may be incurred, I may revise the criteria.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",

RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . \r\nUnder the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been excluded, private email addresses, names of position candidates, and other private information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. This information has also been redacted from these records in accordance with 5 ILCS 140/7(f) concerning preliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated as well as factual information that is inextricably bound up with deliberative material related to the many issues at play between the parties and subject matters mentioned in the request.

ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Lastly, documents have been redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(m) exempts communications between a public body and an attorney representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation including attorney-client privileged material. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, you have the right to challenge this response under 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) by filing a request for review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. Thank you for your request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Robert Lowell Moore, Jr., aka Robin Moore (October 31, 1925 \u2013 February 21, 2008). He was an author of such books as The Green Berets, The French Connection, and Court Martial. All or some of this file has been released to a prior requestor(s); a portion was published by a now defunct blog, Entropic Memes, in 2008. Mr. Moore's case file number is identified by that requestor as 94-61092. Please see attached documents and the following link archived by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165610/http://www.slugsite.com/archives/897\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting any parts of Mr. Moore's file that have been released previously and those not yet released.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search for Mr. Moore. This would include any files the bureau may have on the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana, or JURE (Bureau file number 105-114543; Miami file number 105-6661).\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Moore's privacy, as he passed away on February 21, 2008. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. Please see attached documents and the following link, for an obituary published by the New York Times on February 23, 2008: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/books/23moore.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Per the bureau's prior release of Mr. Moore's file, at least one bureau memo, dated May 5, 1965, states of The Green Berets, \"classified information is contained in Moore's book.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored Mr. Moore in this period as well. Please see a clip of press coverage about The Green Berets, attached, which was archived by the CIA shortly after the May 5, 1965 bureau memo. This document can found in the CIA's CREST system and in the Reading Room on its website: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00149R000700610012-8.pdf\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how the bureau and other agencies handled investigations into journalists and writers who covered or disclosed the actions of American intelligence agencies is in the public's interest.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Please see a clip of press coverage about The Green Berets, attached,\r\n    which was archived by the CIA shortly after the May 5, 1965 bureau memo.\r\n    This document can found in the CIA's CREST system and in the Reading Room on\r\n    its website:\r\n    https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00149R000700610012-8.pdf\r\n    \r\n    Understanding how the bureau and other agencies handled investigations into\r\n    journalists and writers who covered or disclosed the actions of American\r\n    intelligence agencies is in the public's interest.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would\r\n    prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available\r\n    or CD-ROM if not.\r\n    \r\n    This request is not being made for commercial purposes.

Near the bottom of the page there are links to 4 PDFs and 1 Zip file which have the documents from the case responsive to your request. One of the PDFs contains an exemption log detailing redacted and withheld content and exemptions applied. \r\n\r\nAlso as a courtesy, I have attached the Order Granting Summary Judgment, dated May 20, 2016, by King County Superior Court Judge Patrick Oishi, which permanently enjoins SPD from releasing any records from the case file regarding the death of Kurt Cobain that had not previously been disclosed; i.e., the records posted on the Blotter. I have also attached the Court of Appeals decision which upholds Judge Oishi\u2019s decision. \r\nAs such, we will now be closing this request. \r\nThank you, \r\nNina Afereti \r\nSPD Legal Unit \r\n \r\nIf you have any questions, you may send a message using the Police Records Request Center or call the Public Disclosure Desk at 206-684-5481. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nPenina Afereti \r\nSeattle Police Department \r\nLegal Unit \r\n \r\nSPD receives between 7, 000 and 8, 000 public records requests annually and is processing between 2, 500 to 3, 000 open requests at any given time. This may result in a slower than anticipated response to your request. Thank you for your \r\npatience. \r\n \r\nAs a reminder you can login at the Police Records Request Center\u00a0where you can access Police online information, manage your profile, submit record requests, track your request status, receive and send messages, make payments, view frequently asked questions, and download your records.",

I was curious if this dataset is representative of the 2023 fiscal year (from 7/1/2022 - 6/30/2023) as requested, or if the data provided was an as-of \"snapshot\" based on the report run date? I ask because it appears there are several employees with \"Company Seniority Dates\" and \"Employees State Begin Dates\" beyond the 2023 fiscal year. Can you also clarify which field should be considered the Employee Start Date, and may we also get a list of non-abbreviated \"Companies\"?",

Looking at some specific employees existing in 2022 that do not exist in the 2023 data, it appears that most of those records belong to \"Faculty, University Staff, and Political Jurisdiction Staff\" with record counts of those classifications having the approximate record count of the difference between the two files. \r\n\r\nWould you be able to clarify the effective date of the data (FY 2023 as requested, or a snapshot in time as of the run of the report), as well as the field that could be considered Employee Start Date? Would it be possible to include these records in the 2023 disclosure as they were provided in response to a separate request for 2022 employee compensation data?  If you could a \"key\" between the company abbreviation provided and their non-abbreviated descriptions/names, that would also be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTyler",

This subset of records with highlighted rows exemplifies the question I had. \r\n\r\nThe first tab \"Comp Rates State + Non-State\". My question regarding this was, in the case of an employee having both state and non-state comp rates, would their total pay be the two amounts added together? These rates are highlighted in orange in this tab. \r\n\r\nThe second tab \"Employee StartBeginDates\"  highlights employee start/begin dates and seniority dates, some of which go beyond the FY2023 timeframe originally requested.  I was curious if this dataset is representative of the 2023 fiscal year (from 7/1/2022 - 6/30/2023) as requested, or if the data provided was an as-of \"snapshot\" based on the report run date? I would also like to ask which of these two dates should be considered an employee's hire date? \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nTyler K.\r\n",

Contents of emails and attachments highlighted on attached email log released via FOIA N014357-101523. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including date of birth, social security number, parents\u2019 names, birth place, race/ethnicity, employee identification number, vital records\u2019 identification numbers, signatures, school transcripts, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Redactions were made pursuant to section 7(1)(v) of the FOIA, which exempts from release \u201c[v]ulnerability assessments, security measures, and response policies or plans that are designed to identify, prevent, or respond to potential attacks upon a community's population or systems, facilities, or installations, but only to the extent that disclosure could reasonably be expected to expose the vulnerability or jeopardize the effectiveness of the measures, policies, or plans, or the safety of the personnel who implement them or the public. Information exempt under this item may include such things as details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel or equipment, to the operation of communication systems or protocols, to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, or to tactical operations.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(v). Finally, redactions were applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

No our form does not make you pre-authorize costs of \"at least $20.\" It starts at $10-$20. $10 being the cost per police report. $20 being the cost per 911 call, body cam, and photos. We chose those number methodically to match our fee schedule.

        "communication": "The provided billing sheet is exactly what I was looking for, thank you. \r\n\r\nI would like to request the re-consideration of the fees associated with this GRAMA request. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it seems there may be a misunderstanding about the classification of CAD reports. These are not the same as \"police reports,\" and should not be billed as such. CAD reports are generally communication logs generated automatically during the course of a dispatcher\u2019s duty, often with minimal intervention from human personnel. Charging $10 per CAD report as if they were comprehensive police reports seems inconsistent with your city\u2019s comprehensive fee schedule. The listed staff time of one half hour only further emphasizes the point that the fee quoted is unreasonable.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe that my request serves a significant public interest. The records I seek are pertinent to a story of great importance to the community, and their release would contribute to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. As such, I believe a fee waiver would be appropriate in this case, and your refusal based on maintaining impartiality among media outlets does not seem to align with the spirit or letter of GRAMA.\r\n\r\nGiven the above factors, I kindly request that the fees associated with my GRAMA request be re-considered and waived. If this is not possible, I would like to escalate this matter and request the contact information for the Chief Administrative Officer for the Springville Police Department for a formal appeal. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPatrick Wells",

Though they aren\u2019t the same thing, they cost the same, as we go through the same retrieval, redaction and certification process. With this being a decently large request of 10 reports, the 30 minutes is very fair, if not less time than usual. For out of state media representatives, per GRAMA code 63G-2-203(5), we start charging for our time as soon as we start working on the request. I have attached a screenshot that shows the timer for your request, with this email in the background. We receive many requests regarding the same cases daily. Everyone has understood the significance of us charging the fees to keep impartial for every media outlet, large or small. I hope you can understand where we are coming from, by wanting to give each media outlet the equal opportunity to obtain these records. If you change your mind on paying the fees, please let me know and we can do payment and I will get the reports sent over immediately. I have inserted the appeal instructions below.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2026following the procedures in UCA \u00a763G-2-401. Please be sure to attach your initial request and denial letter when appealing. You may submit a request for appeal to the City Recorder, via mail at 110 S Main, Springville, UT 84663 within 30 days or via email at kcrane@springville.org.\u201d\n",

        "communication": "Ms. Crane,\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally appeal the fee imposed by the Springville Police Department in response to my Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA) request dated 10/9/23. The communications associated with this request are attached below this message. The fees imposed by Springville Police Dept, along with my contact information, are included in an attachment.\r\n\r\nThe request sought an electronic copy of the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports for all calls for service at 1803 E River Bottom Rd for the time period of January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. The Springville Police Department has classified CAD reports as \"police reports,\" consequently levying a charge exceeding $100 based on the city's comprehensive fee schedule, which stipulates a $10 charge per police report.\r\n\r\nFirst, I contend that CAD reports should not be classified as police reports. CAD reports are primarily data-driven, capturing basic information about calls for service, and are generally not completed by police officers. They differ significantly from police reports, which are narrative and provide detailed accounts of incidents. The reclassification and charging for each CAD report as a police report is not only misrepresentative but also unduly increases the cost of obtaining these public records, contrary to the spirit of GRAMA which aims to promote transparency and ease of access to public records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I request that the fees associated with this GRAMA request be waived entirely, given the significant public interest surrounding the events at the aforementioned address. The Springville Police Department\u2019s rationale to decline a fee waiver to maintain impartiality across media outlets is flawed. Impartiality is not achieved by denying fee waivers to all, but rather, would be accomplished through the provision of fee waivers to all media outlets, thereby leveling the playing field and truly adhering to the spirit of GRAMA which encourages public access to information. Utah\u2019s GRAMA, under Section 63G-2-203(4)(a), encourages fee waivers when releasing the records primarily benefits the public rather than a person. I assert that the routine denial of fee waivers based not on the merits of the request, but on a mistaken believe that this encourages impartiality, is in violation of GRAMA. The national discourse surrounding the incidents in question unmistakably demonstrates that the release of these records primarily serves the public interest.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in alignment with the provisions and the spirit of GRAMA, I strongly appeal for a full waiver of the fees associated with this request or, at the very least, a significant reduction by reclassifying the CAD reports and charging only for staff time.\r\n\r\nI am willing to discuss this appeal further at your convenience. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPatrick Wells",

(Nasdaq: SSTI) (formerly ShotSpotter), a leading provider of public safety technology solutions, today announced that the Fort Lauderdale Police Department has agreed to implement SoundThinking\u2019s Data for Good program. The program\u2019s official launch on August 1st coincides with National Night Out (NNO), an annual community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships.\r\n\r\nData for Good is a community-focused program that enables law enforcement agencies to share precision data about where and when gun violence occurs with non-law enforcement organizations. SoundThinking helps law enforcement customers identify offices of violence prevention, schools, city and county public health departments and other community organizations to receive gunfire data. By indicating where gunfire and potential trauma may be occurring, appropriate community resources can be deployed to help prevent future violence, address root causes, and provide assistance to those adversely impacted by exposure to persistent gun violence.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy embracing the Data for Good Program, we can now pivot to a holistic community-based approach to violence prevention, outreach, and community engagement,\u201d said Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Patrick Lynn. \u201cThis fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility for community safety rather than relying solely on punitive measures. By bridging the gap between law enforcement and the community, we can co-create effective solutions that deter crime and nurture an environment where individuals can thrive and reach their full potential.\u201d \r\n\r\nFort Lauderdale Police Department joins agencies in Miami-Dade County, FL, Baton Rouge, LA, Springfield, IL, and Mobile, AL, in implementing Data for Good programs. Through the program, these areas actively address gun violence and improve community ties with law enforcement.\r\n\r\n\"As a company, we believe that by harnessing data-driven insights and looking at them through a different lens, our customers can allocate resources to those impacted by the traumatic impact of gunfire,\u201d said Alfred Lewers Jr., Senior Director of Trauma Response & Community Engagement at SoundThinking. \u201cOur Data for Good program aims to support our customers\u2019 public health approach to gun violence reduction, and we are thrilled that the Fort Lauderdale Police Department is now among a growing list of agencies best-positioned to support community partners working to proactively and effectively address the root causes of gun violence.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how ShotSpotter assists community-based and civic programs, please visit our Data for Good page.\r\n\r\nSOURCE: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/01/2715842/0/en/Fort-Lauderdale-Community-Based-and-Public-Health-Groups-to-Benefit-From-SoundThinking-s-Data-For-Good-Program.html",

However, to narrow and expedite your request, a spreadsheet of all claim for damages can be provide to you for you to identify which specific claim for damages you are seeking.

While I understand the complexity of processing over 7,000 complaints, I would like to express my concern about the proposed timeline of 90-120 days or more to complete the request.\r\n\r\nAs you may recall, my original request was submitted on March 5, 2023, and I have been actively engaged in correspondence to clarify and expedite the request. The prolonged delay has already impacted the timeliness of accessing these records.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that the FCC consider prioritizing this request and explore ways to reduce the processing time, if possible. If there are specific categories or subsets of complaints that can be provided more quickly, I am open to discussing a phased approach to receiving the records.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm this email address as my current contact information. If you have any questions or need further clarification, I prefer to continue our correspondence via email to maintain a clear and transparent record of our communication.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you to ensure a timely and transparent response to this request.

Each owner possesses a certain percentage of the real property...\"\r\nhttps://thepittmanlawoffice.com/property-ownership-in-florida/\r\n\r\nPer Florida Statute 196.081(1)(a) \u2018Any real estate that is owned and used as a homestead by a veteran who was honorably discharged with a service-connected total and permanent disability and for whom a letter from the United States Government or United States Department of Veterans Affairs or its predecessor has been issued certifying that the veteran is totally and permanently disabled is exempt from taxation, if the veteran is a permanent resident of this state on January 1 of the tax year for which exemption is being claimed or was a permanent resident of this state on January 1 of the year the veteran died.\u2019\r\n \r\nThe statute in question doesn\u2019t say \u201csolely owned.\u201d A plain language reading indicates 127 Delvalle St. would be fully exempt from taxation, even if my ex-wife is listed on the title. \r\n \r\nOn 1/1/2022 Mrs. Parker stated \u201cBecause your ex-wife is still on the title, only half of your value will be protected under your total & permanent exemption. What this means is you will be \u2018taxed\u2019 on the 50% she owns.\u201d \r\n \r\nFurther, the final judgment entered never stated my ex-wife had a 50% ownership stake in the home.\r\n\r\nhe exact amount my wife \u201cowns\u201d of the home is never stated in the final judgment, as the amount listed  included property besides the house. The amount stated that she was owed for an equalizing payment has been paid down to approximately $30,000. \r\n \r\n$30,000 Of $396,910 comes out to 7.6%. So my ex owns approximately 7.6% of the home. \r\n \r\nIs it possible for the county to amend the 2022 property tax amount for 127 Delvalle St. Melbourne Beach, FL? \r\n \r\nMichael Locke\u201c \r\n\r\n\u201cFrom: Ed Pollock <ed.pollock@bcpao.us>\r\nSent: Tuesday, November 22, 2022 2:05 PM\r\nTo: mbl22885@msn.com <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSubject: Homestead Exemption Status\r\n \r\nMr. Locke,\r\n \r\nI am writing you based on your recent dialogue with Melissa Parker of this office regarding your homestead exemption.  I understand after several email exchanges you continue to assert you are entitled to exempt 100% of the value your property you currently hold as tenants in common with your former spouse.\r\n \r\nTenants in Common is real property that is shared among more than one owner. Each owner possesses a certain percentage of the real property\u2026\r\n \r\nMelissa correctly advised that you are entitled to a homestead exemption on only the 50% of the value of your home. That decision is based on your divorce final judgement order. The court order clearly states your former spouse retains 50% ownership of the home until your former spouse executes a quit claim deed conveying her interest in the property to you.  The court ordered criteria leading up to the execution of the quit claim deed is not relevant to your current percentage of legal ownership and rights regarding your qualified exemption.\r\n \r\nWhile married you and your spouse were tenants in the entirety. \r\n \r\nTenancy by the entirety in Florida is a form of joint ownership that protects property from creditors of either spouse. With tenants by entireties, both spouses own an undivided interest in 100% of the property. If either spouse dies, the surviving spouse inherits full ownership of tenants by entireties assets.\r\n \r\nYou are qualified for the homestead exemption on the 50% you own, that includes a Total & Permanent Service-Connected exemption, but only on the 50% you own.  The remaining 50% is owned by your former spouse.  You can not exempt what you do not own.  Once a quit claim deed is executed awarding 100% ownership to you; you can file an updated application for the entire value of the property.  \r\n \r\nIf your position is unchanged, I advise you to seek competent legal counsel in this matter.  Please conduct any future inquires directly to me in this matter.\r\n \r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nEd Pollock\r\nSenior Director Customer Service & Compliance\r\nBrevard County Property Appraiser\u201d",

This has all been explained in your communications with Mr. Pollock and Ms. Parker.  As a married couple, you and your then wife were entitled to your total and permanent disability on 100% of the assessed value of the property.  After the divorce, you and your ex-wife share a 50% ownership each.  Your total and permanent exemption can only be placed on your 50% of the value while the other 50% owned by your ex-wife is fully taxable.\r\n\r\nAlso addressed in the previous communications is 50/50 split of the property after the divorce.  This was determined in the final judgement and mechanizations of law, how much she owes or does not owe does not determine her percentage of ownership.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]\r\n\r\nwww.bcpao.us<http://www.bcpao.us>\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<https://www.linkedin.com/company/brevard-county-property-appraiser>[cid:image003.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<https://twitter.com/brevardpropappr>[cid:image004.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<https://www.facebook.com/bcpao/>\r\n\r\nGeorge Mascellino, CAE, AAS, CFE\r\nCert Gen RZ2863\r\nChief Deputy Property Appraiser\r\nBrevard County Property Appraiser\r\n\r\nPhone: 321-264-6702\r\nFax: 321-264-5187\r\nEmail: george.mascellino@BCPAO.us<mailto:george.mascellino@BCPAO.us>\r\n400 South Street, 5th floor\r\nTitusville, FL 32780\r\n\r\n[cid:image005.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<http://www.bcpao.us/>\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Florida law, email addresses are public records.

This request is to include all communications from Superintendent John Boyd discussing plans to notify the community, parents and staff of the shooting.\"\r\n\r\nYou may know that state law contemplates that a public agency like our School District should fulfill simple records requests within five business days. However, under that law additional time is granted when: (1) The agency needs to obtain clarification as to the scope of records being sought; (2) Simply locating and gathering the records will take significant time; (3) The agency must review the records once gathered, to identify and excise (or \"redact\") any content that is protected from disclosure; and/or (4) To give an opportunity for persons named in the records, or to whom they pertain, to seek imposition of judicial limitations on the scope of records that will be disclosed to you, based on assertion(s) of personal privacy rights they may decide to initiate.\r\n\r\nAt least reasons (1) and (2) apply to your request, requiring more time for the processing and fulfillment of it. As to our need for clarification, the first segment of your request seeks documents, internal communications, and communications with the Board of Directors \"pertaining to\" the shooting in the McKenzie stadium parking lot. Since reasonable persons can disagree on what records do and do not \"pertain to\" any particular topic, we are left guessing about the parameters of what you are asking for in processing your request. To that end, if you were to clarify that by the first segment of your request you seek documents, internal communications, and communications with the Board of Directors \"directly and fairly discussing\" reports of shots fired in the vicinity of McKenzie Stadium on October 19, 2023, I am reasonably confident we will be able to understand what you seek. Please let me know if you are agreeable to that clarification.\r\n\r\nFinally, records disclosure laws require that I provide you our best estimate as to when we will have records ready for production to you. I anticipate that we'll be able to produce the records you seek on or before December 2, 2023. That is indeed an estimate. If it develops that a materially shorter or longer timeframe is necessary, I'll let you know.

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThank you for the clarification. To reiterate your request, specifically the portions of your request that pertain to email communications stored on the District\u2019s server, I understand you to be seeking emails using the following date range: October 19, 2023 \u2013 October 20, 2023, sent by:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Internal communications; The District interprets this to mean emails sent between employees of the District\r\n  2.  Any email sent by any member of the Board\r\n  3.  Any email sent by John Boyd, or John Boyd\u2019s assistant, Lori Strohl\r\n\r\nAND containing any of the following keywords:\r\n\r\nshooting\r\nshot\r\ngun\r\nfirearm\r\npolice\r\nstadium\r\nparking lot\r\nlockdown\r\nparking lot to the south of McKenzie Stadium \u2013 We simplified the last term to \u201cMcKenzie\u201d since \u201cparking lot\u201d and \u201cstadium\u201d are already included in the list.\r\n\r\nOur IT Department has run a preliminary search on the District email server based on the above parameters. The total number of emails responsive to Item 1 is 8,847. The total number of emails responsive to Items 2 and 3 combined is 16 (these are also included in the 8,847 emails responsive to Item 1).\r\n\r\nBased on our past experience as to the number of pages typical for emails of those sorts, and the number of pages of attachments that would be expected to have been associated with the sending of emails of those sorts, we'd expect those emails, with such attachments, to average somewhere in the range of 5 pages each. That translates to a total estimated number of pages of records in need of production to you of 44,235.\r\n\r\nEach of those 44,235 pages of records would need to be read, individually, before being produced to you, in order to identify any content that is exempt from public disclosure within them, according to any of the well-more-than 100 different state and federal statutory privacy and confidentiality laws that can apply under the Public Records Act.  In particular, given the nature of the emails you've requested, a very large number of them would be expected to have content subject to just one of those many exemptions - that being, content that is the statutorily-private and -confidential educational or personal information of identifiable District students. Each email having that sort of content would need to be identified, and then the student's name or any other personally-identifying information about him/her (e.g. parent's name, residential address, phone number, personal email address of the student or of his/her parent or siblings, etc.) then would need to be selectively redacted on a word-by-word basis from the email, before it is provided to you.\r\n\r\nReview and redaction, even just for the exemptions applicable to that kind of student information, is a very technical, painstaking, and time-consuming process.  Because of that, it is very difficult to provide any sort of accurate estimate as to how long we believe it will take to fulfill your request.  Given the limited resources we have to process requests like yours, and that in the end (with other aspects of your request) we know your request will require production of well more than 8,847 emails, that time frame estimate would have to be that it will take us many, many months to entirely fulfill your request.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we can give you a reliably accurate estimate as to when we'll be able to provide you an initial, partial installment of responsive emails.  In that regard, we anticipate we'll be able to do that within the timeframe of the previously provided estimate, on or before December 2, 2023. And then, we'd plan on thereafter making another partial installment of records to you every 60 days, until fulfillment of your request has been completed.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will need to receive an advance payment from you of the fees chargeable to you for processing this request. To that point, the law authorizes that we charge requestors like yourself $.05 cents for every 4 electronic files that are in need of being duplicated in order to fulfill a request like yours.  We can either seek pre-payment of the entire amount if we can determine with certainty what that overall ultimate amount will be, or charge a 10% advance payment of an amount that we reasonably can determine will not be any greater than that ultimately-chargeable overall fee.\r\n\r\nHere, since each email you've requested is a separate electronic file for purposes of determining those chargeable fees, it appears that fulfillment of your request will end up requiring an overall payment by you of not less than $110.58 (i.e., 8,847 x .25) x .05 cents). We will need to receive a 10% advance payment ($11.05) before we can provide you the first partial installment of records toward overall fulfillment of your request that I've told you to expect by December 2, 2023. The remaining 90% will be due prior to providing you the final installment of records.\r\n\r\nYou can mail the payment of $11.05 directly to me, at the address below:\r\n\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\nAttn: Eliza Cornelison\r\nP.O. Box 8910\r\nVancouver, WA 98668\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you wish to make the payment in person at our School District's business office, you may do so at the District Office, located at 13413 NE LeRoy Haagen Memorial Drive, Vancouver, WA 98684, during school day business hours ( 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.).  In any case, payment by check, money order, or other similar instrument should be made payable to \"Evergreen School District No. 114\" and it would be helpful if a memo notation were made on the check stating \"Payment of PRA Request Fees.\" I suggest calling ahead to make sure the office is open, and I'm available to receive your payment.\r\n\r\nPlease also be advised that under governing provisions of the Public Records Act, we need to receive your payment, per the above, within 30 calendar days of today's date, or your request will be considered to have been abandoned by you and it will be closed.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the time frame I've estimated above for initial partial and/or ultimately complete of your request, and/ or the payment amounts I've referenced, are longer or larger than you expected or that will meet your informational needs or desires.  If that is the case, you may be able to reduce the time frame and/or monetary payment amount requirements I've described, by narrowing your request and/or seeking different records, such that fulfillment of it requires a lesser number of records and/or different sorts of records that would not prompt need for the sort of time-consuming review/redaction/exemption processing work that I described above.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re only seeking the 16 emails responsive to items 2 and 3 of your request, I\u2019m confident I could produce all of the records you\u2019re seeking on or before December 2, 2023, and the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees ($0.20) would be waived.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to go the route of substituting your current request for one that is for a narrower or different set of records, you need only send me an email describing with reasonable specificity that different scope of records you'd like to receive, and we will thereupon proceed to instead work toward fulfillment of your request according to those terms.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360\u2013604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the use of body cameras, including:\r\n  a. policies or procedures governing use of body cameras;\r\n  b. what types of data are obtained;\r\n  c. the conditions under which body cameras are used;\r\n  d. the frequency of body camera use;\r\n  e. the number of body camera units or systems acquired;\r\n  f. the number of officers equipped with body cameras;\r\n\r\n2. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the review of body camera data by supervising officers or staff or civilian review personnel to ensure officer compliance with department or agency policies and applicable state and federal law;\r\n\r\n3. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the storage of data obtained using body cameras, including:\r\n  a. where the data is stored;\r\n  b. how long data is stored;\r\n  c. when data must be discarded; and\r\n  d. how much data your agency or department currently stores;\r\n\r\n4. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning access to body camera data, including:\r\n  a. the legal justification required before a law enforcement employee or member of the public may access body camera data;\r\n  b. purposes for which the data may be accessed;\r\n  c. purposes for which the data may not be accessed;\r\n  d. who may access the data, what procedures they must go through to obtain access, and who must authorize access; and\r\n  e. the existence of a system that records who accesses the data and when the data is accessed;\r\n\r\n5. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the sharing of data obtained through body cameras, including:\r\n  a. what type of data is shared;\r\n  b. what databases your agency puts collected body camera data into; and\r\n  c. third parties, governmental or private, that may access your agency's body camera data, including what procedures a third party must go through to access the data and any restrictions placed on a third party regarding further sharing of your body camera data;\r\n\r\n6. All agreements to share body camera data with outside agencies or departments, corporations, or other entities; and\r\n\r\n7. All training materials used to instruct members of your department or agency in body camera deployment, data management, or operation of automated records systems that contain body camera data to which any member of your department or agency has access, including regional or shared databases.\r\n\r\nIf this records request is denied in whole or in part, please provide (1) whether the documents in question exists, and if so, (2) the statutory exemption you are claiming prevents their release. If Jefferson Davis County Sheriff's Department claims an exemption for some of the requested documents, please produce those for which it does not claim an exemption, including records where the exempt portions are redacted. \r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents will be made available to the general public, this request is not being made for commercial purposes, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, I am requesting a waiver of any fees for searching or copying these records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. If possible, I prefer that the records be produced in electronic format.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBlake Feldman",

All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, that was written by or sent to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present date that contains the following words or phrases:\r\n\u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cballot(s)\u201d, \u201celection fraud\u201d, and \u201cballot fraud\u201d\r\n2. All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, to and from the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present that has a subject matter relating to \u201coperational changes\u201d\r\n3. All memos and correspondence written to or from the office of the Inspector General from 5/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201corganizational changes\u201d, and \u201c2020 election\u201d\r\n4. All email correspondence between high-ranking officials at USPS from 7/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201cchanges\u201d, \u201cethics\u201d, \u201ccomplaints\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, and \u201corganizational changes\u201d\r\n5. All data sheets from 5/1/2020 that describe organizational changes in the operation of the United States Postal Service\r\n6. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to the present \r\n7. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020\r\nFee Waiver:\r\nI hereby request that all fees be waived as this is a matter of public interest.\r\n1. The records that are being requested concerns \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d. This is since the Postmaster General acts as the decision making body that is in charge of determining whether changes are to be made inside the United States Postal Service. Also, the OIG acts as a watchdog over USPS and thus is in and of itself participating in \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d.\r\n2. The documents requested will contribute to the understanding of the stated \u201coperation or activities of the government\u201d. The documents requested will allow for insight into the decision for the USPS to be processing mail more slowly and alerting that mail-in ballots might not get to voters on time. There have been calls made by members of Congress to investigate said activities as well. This significance of said records have been demonstrated through various news outlets as well as a letter by a senator.\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-reviewing-dejoy/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-letter-usps-practices/index.html\r\n3. The records requested directly impacts millions of Americans that will be voting by mail in the upcoming election. This is since these records will provide insight into how mail-in voting will operate through the United States Postal Service. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many Americans will decide to vote by mail instead of voting in person. In a survey conducted in May 2020, 64% of Americans were in favor of voting by mail (https://news.gallup.com/poll/310586/americans-favor-voting-mail-option-november.aspx). These records will allow the public to determine whether or not it will be the best option to vote by mail. This is since these records can show or not show whether or not the systematic changes in the United States Postal Service will have a direct impact on whether a voter decides to vote by mail or not. This will also allow for due diligence to be made by states in order to make sure that every vote is counted in the appropriate manner. The documents will be available publicly and will be disseminated across news outlets in order to inform the public. \r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-mail-voting-fraud.html\r\n4. The documents requested will allow for a clear understanding of \u201cthe operations and activities of government\u201d. Presently, the public doesn\u2019t have information to evaluate as to whether the changes made in USPS will impact how mail-in voting will occur in the upcoming election. This is since there is no information that is readily available as it is breaking news and has recently been covered by news outlets. Currently, the Speaker of the House is requesting a hearing where the present Postmaster General is requested to appear and testify (https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html). These documents will be able to direct the course of the congressional hearing as it will give insight into the changes in operation at the United States Postal Service.\r\nExpedited Processing\r\n1. I hereby request expedited processing for this request as well. I am not a member of the news media however I am submitting this request through a platform (Muckrock.com), whose primary purpose is to disseminate information. As such, the mode of disseminating information is valid as meeting the first prong for being \u201cprimarily engaged in disseminating information\u201d.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public regarding the requested documents. The current subject matter is ongoing as shown through various news outlets covering the story. This is an urgent matter to all Americans as it directly relates to the processing of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election.\r\nList:\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-demand-postmaster-general-usps-chairman-testify-urgently-on-sabotage-of-postal-service.amp\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/trump-administration-postal-service-elections/index.html\r\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/taylor-swift-slams-trumps-calculated-dismantling-usps-rcna83\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/08/15/902811968/trump-offers-conflicting-statements-on-mail-in-voting-usps-funding\r\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/13/us-postal-service-whats-going-post-office-what-we-know/3360565001/\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/usps-vote-mail.html\r\n2. This is currently a breaking news story whose value would be diminished without these records. Also, there is currently a pending request to have the Postmaster General appear in Congress in order to testify. The previous news releases demonstrates the urgency in obtaining these records.\r\n3. The requested records clearly concerns federal government activity. This is since the records will explain the process taken that has caused USPS to have organizational changes. Also, it will determine whether there was any wrongdoing based on possible records that will show communications with specific words that will be instrumental in evaluating the decisions made by the Postmaster General.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarlos Gamez\n\n",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Gamez:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your August 17 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for records related to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to Postmaster General (PMG) Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"mail in ballots\", \"2020 election\", \"ballot(s)\", \"election fraud\", \"ballot fraud\".\r\n  2.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to PMG Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present having a subject matter relating to \"operational changes\".\r\n  3.  Memos or correspondence written to or from the OIG from 5/1/2020 to present containing \"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\".\r\n  4.  Email correspondence between high-ranking officials at the U.S. Postal Service from 7/1/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"Louis DeJoy\", \"changes\", \"ethics\", \"complaints\", \"2020 election\", \"mail in ballots\", and \"organizational changes\".\r\n  5.  All data sheets from 5/1/2020 describing organizational changes in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n  6.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n  7.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgement is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office, along with the St Louis Requester Service Center, is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Information on the USPIS is available on the Internet at: https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \"oversight authority\" for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause records related to items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 would be potentially maintained by the Postal Service, we have referred your request to their FOIA office for processing and direct response to you. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them online at https://pfoiapal.usps.com/, via email at foia12@usps.gov<mailto:foia12@usps.gov>, via phone at (202) 268-2608, via fax at (202) 268-5353, or in writing at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Service Records Office\r\n\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P830\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20260-4541\r\n\r\nRegarding item #3, in order for us to process this portion of your request, under C.F.R. Title 39 \u00a7 265.3(c) requires requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. If seeking information about a company, requesters should provide the exact name and address of the company (many companies use similar names). Therefore, we will need you to please provide a listing of the names of any OIG employees you wish us to search against. Limiting the number of names you provide will substantially increase the time it takes to locate and process any responsive records.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive the listing of OIG employee names, in order to conduct an adequate search for these records, we would need to do a data transfer of the entire mailbox of each individual you choose to name (to include inbox, sent items, and deleted items) and place these data files in a secure location. At this point, FOIA staff will be able to conduct key word search of \"\"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\", and/or any other search term you may suggest.  We would then need to review each data file for responsiveness before conducting a line-by-line examination to determine what information may be released in accordance with FOIA regulations. We understand this portion of your request to be for memos or correspondence related to \"organizational changes\" recently in the news at the Postal Service, not the OIG. Be advised e-mails are not considered an established system of records under the Privacy Act and would be considered for release only under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive a listing of named OIG employee profiles by COB September 15, we will presume you are no longer interested in pursuing this request and will close your file, but you may file again later. You may return the completed form via e-mail at foia@uspsoig.gov<mailto:foia@uspsoig.gov> or U.S. Mail at 1735 N. Lynn Street, Arlington, VA 22209.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

The FOIA allows agencies twenty (20) working days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) to process requests.  In unusual circumstances, agencies may qualify for further extensions, and may request a modified FOIA request and/or time frame for response.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).\r\n\r\n\u201cUnusual circumstances\u201d apply to the processing of a request if one or more of the following apply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another department or agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii).\r\n\r\nThis letter serves as timely notice that unusual circumstances apply to your request as a result of item outlined above. As such, we are extending the response period until December 2, 2022, instead of September 30, 2022, as stated in my previous correspondence.  You will be contacted on or immediately after that date.\r\n\r\nAgain, please accept my apologies for the delay response.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNancy P. Chavannes\r\nNancy P. Chavannes\r\nDeputy Chief FOIA Officer",

But now the area I live in is changing. Investors are coming in, buying the buildings they're renting to anybody they can rent to. The rents have gone up five, six, $700. Next door to me, there's a Ukraine, Ukraine owner. Well, first thing he wanted to do was make the building into a four flat. And I told him, You'll never do it while I'm living here.  And he says to me, he says, This is America. He says, this is freedom. He says, I can do anything I want. I told them if I was a younger man, I said I would beat the hell out of you because of freedom. Freedom says I can beat you up. And I says, I would have whipped your ass so fast. But he doesn't talk to me no more. ...\"\r\n\r\nAt which point the board president laughed heartily. \r\n\r\nVideo of this event can be found on the village's board meetings archive here:\r\n<https://play.champds.com/nilesil/event/236/s/4240>\r\n\r\nA complaint was lodged regarding the behavior of the board president with the Village of Niles Community Relations Commission at their August 2nd, 2023 meeting in public comment. \r\n\r\nAudio of this meeting can be found via this FOIA:\r\n<https://www.muckrock.com/foi/niles-8224/crc-meeeting-audio-8-2023-150153/#files>\r\n\r\nCommissioner Tony Dati made this statement regarding this complaint:\r\n\r\n\"So definitely can bring it up to him, I can bring it up to him, and talk to him about it. \r\n[Another speaker: By him are you referring to the mayor?]\r\nThe whole board, mayor and board.\r\n \u2026all right we\u2019ll definitely address all this and look into all this and try to have something prepared for our next meeting. \"\r\n\r\nIn the next meeting on October 11, 2023, this complaint was not addressed as promised. \r\n\r\nTo this effect, we are requesting all communications between Commissioner Tony Dati and any member of the Village of Niles board between the date of this meeting on August 2nd, 2023 and the following meeting on October 11, 2023.
