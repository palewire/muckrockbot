        "communication": "05/03/2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREFER TO:  218929/2017-0627 \n\nMs. Melissa Hill \nEmail: 32268-37981512@requests.muckrock.com \n\nDear Ms. Hill: \n\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act request dated 4/19/2017, and received by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on the same date, in which you requested records concerning Anarchism, Anarchist Extremism and/or Anarchist Extremists from 2015 to present. Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 218929.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 26 pages of responsive material.  Eight pages were found to be non-responsive and eight-teen pages are withheld in full. Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nWe are withholding third party information, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6). To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested. Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).  \nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees, under Exemption (b)(7)(C). Exemption (b)(7)(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The public interest under Exemption (b)(7)(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party. In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA, but rather, would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C).  \nWe are withholding specific law enforcement codes, techniques, and procedures used in our investigation pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(E) exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records or information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). The information withheld reveals various law enforcement file numbers and codes which are primarily used to store and retrieve law enforcement information. The information withheld also reveals specific law enforcement procedures and techniques used in this investigation. Disclosure of this information could enable individuals outside of the agency to circumvent agency functions and gain access to sensitive investigative information. Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division",

We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the extra-large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.fbi.gov%2Ffdps-1%2F%40%40search-fdps&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=B6S2vFgDgOWQqiCCwRvUsZQgDAHF1diXKG5fYH3T12M%3D&reserved=0> | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbi.gov%2Ffoia&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uaXvm%2Fg3l2HzET7puRKzFvk4XQEvSW%2FUHofbeKfFAng%3D&reserved=0> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D9F6A0.23F1CDF0][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]\n",

As you noted, you have transferred the request to Customs and Border Protection, presumably because some of the documents I requested originated in CBP. However, the following citatione appear to refer to DHS (and not CBP) documents:\r\n- DHS; IIR 4 006 0620 16; 27 FEB 2016; DOI 30 DEC 2015; Peluche HSO Transporting UDAS from Central America, Turkey, and China into the United States (footnote 8)\r\n- DHS; IIR 4 012 0079; 08 SEP 2016; DOI 14-24 APR 2016; Smuggling Routes and Methods from China to the United States (footnote 17)\r\n- DHS; IIR 4 042 0179 15; 29 MAY 2015; DOI 01 Mar 2015; CBP - Chinese Nationals Apprehended Near McAllen, Texas Provide Details of Their Travel Route to the United States (footnote 19)\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe your final response may have been made in error. Would you be able to reopen the request for just those three documents, or should I file a new one? I look forwards to hearing back from you soon.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMatthew",

For\r\nexample, pursuant to Section 552.261 of the Texas Government Code, the\r\nDistrict will charge ten ($.10) cents per page for paper copies, if\r\napplicable. The District will pass along other costs incurred. In the event\r\nthat the charges for the information exceed $100.00 you may be required to\r\npost a cash bond before soft or hard copies are made.

The request sought records related to water quality complaints and issues within the Albany, Schenectady, and Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) from January 1, 2018, to the present. I have not received a response, acknowledgment, or any communication from the Troy Water Department regarding my request. Pursuant to FOIL, the agency is required to respond within five business days.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, my original request sought the following information:\r\n\r\n1) The total number of water quality complaints received by your agency/authority/utility, broken down by year.\r\n2) A detailed summary of each water quality complaint, including the date, location, nature of the complaint, any actions taken, and the resolution or current status.\r\n3) Any reports, memos, or other documentation related to water quality complaints, investigations, and resolutions within the specified area and timeframe.\r\n\r\nI followed up on my original request with two subsequent emails on April 11, 2023, and April 26, 2023, requesting a response or an update on the status of my request. However, I have not received any acknowledgment or response from the Troy Water Department.\r\n\r\nThe summary denial of access to the requested records is in violation of FOIL. I respectfully request that you reconsider my request and provide the requested records or a valid explanation for withholding them within ten business days, as required by FOIL.\r\n\r\nIf my appeal is denied, please provide a written explanation for the denial and inform me of any further appeal procedures available under New York State law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to receiving your response.",

I appreciate your attention to this matter, and I would like to address some of the points you raised in your letter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I understand your concern about the method of submission and tracking of FOIL requests. However, I would like to clarify that my request was submitted through MuckRock, a widely recognized platform used for submitting and tracking FOIL requests. This platform is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and ease of use for both the requestor and the agency. It is not intended to circumvent any established procedures but to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the FOIL process.\r\n\r\nSecondly, regarding the issue of timeliness, I would like to remind you that according to Article 6 (Section 84-90) of the New York State's Freedom of Information Law, an agency is required to respond to a FOIL request within five business days of receipt. If the agency cannot provide the requested records within that timeframe, it must provide a written acknowledgment of receipt and a reasonable date by which the request will be granted or denied. In this case, I have not received such acknowledgment or estimated date.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to reiterate my commitment to working collaboratively with your agency to fulfill this FOIL request. I understand the importance of following proper procedures and am willing to cooperate fully to ensure that this process is carried out in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you reconsider your position and provide the requested records or a reasonable timeline for their provision. I look forward to your prompt response.",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, records have been redacted in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. RESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request.

Also please provide a list of certificated held by this ID number and the name attached to this ID Number. Your request was received in this office on 2/29/2024. \r\n\r\nAfter careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \r\n\r\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components.  Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions.  A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online:  https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information.  If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office.  Otherwise, respond back with your additional information. \r\n\r\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. McArthur:\r\n\r\nThe Office of Court Administration (hereafter \"the Office\") is in receipt of your request for records under the Texas Public Information Act, which we are construing as a request for judicial records under Rule 12<https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1456650/texas-rules-of-judicial-administration.pdf> of the Texas Rules of Judicial Administration.  A copy of your request, which was received by the Office on April 24, 204, is attached for reference.\r\n\r\nYour request seeks copies of records of the procurement and selection \"of the [court's] case management, docketing, and electronic filing systems\" and specifically requests a copy of the current and the previous contract with the current vendor, the request for proposals issued in procuring the vendor's services, responses from other vendors, and documents evaluating the proposals or justifying the decision. The Office is currently under contract to provide an electronic filing system (\"e-File 2.0\") for use in the courts throughout Texas. Your reference to the term \"the court's\" case management, docketing, and electronic filing systems implies a statewide system maintained by the Supreme Court of Texas. We are construing your request to refer to the e-File system. Many, though not all, of the local courts maintain their own case management systems which were procured at the county level. The Office is not the custodian of the records of the procurement or contracts of those local case management systems. To access records of local case management systems, you must file a public information request to the clerks of the district or county courts.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Office did procure the services of approximately three contractors on a separate project to develop a case management system for small or rural counties which would not otherwise procure an automated case management system. However, the Office procured contractors to be available to contract with the counties. Since the Office's contracts were not for statewide (or local) case management, docketing, or electronic filing services but were for contractors to be made available to contract with counties to obtain their own case management systems (if they chose to do so), this project did not seem to fit within the scope of your request. Please let me know if this is not correct and you wish to have copies of records relating to the procurement and contracting on that project.\r\n\r\nYou may find a copy of the current contract for e-File system at this webpage: https://www.txcourts.gov/jcit/electronic-filing/.\r\n\r\nA copy of the request for offer issued to procure the current contract is available here: https://www.txsmartbuy.com/esbd/212210180.\r\n\r\nA copy of the original contract and six amendments is attached to this email.\r\n\r\nA copy of the memo documenting the recommendation of the selected the vendor and the rationale for the recommendation is also attached.\r\n\r\nIt will take more time to review the other responses to the Office's request for offers. I will provide copies of those records to you within a reasonable time but not later than 14 days in accordance with Rule 12.6. I am sending the attached copies of records separately in the interest of responding promptly.\nRegards,\r\nScott Gibson\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nTexas Office of Court Administration\r\n512.463.1461",

I appreciate your assistance with this matter.\r\n\r\nI wanted to kindly express my preference to receive any responsive records through conventional means rather than through the portal. While I understand that the portal is meant to streamline processes, it presents some challenges on my end that I hope we can work around.\r\n\r\nUsing the portal as a requirement poses a few difficulties for me. Firstly, I have concerns about managing yet another set of login credentials. Keeping track of numerous passwords can sometimes become overwhelming, and I strive to maintain a manageable digital footprint.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, relying solely on the portal for record access may present accessibility issues. As much as possible, I try to ensure that my workflows are inclusive and accessible to all. Having alternative methods of accessing records ensures that everyone can participate fully.\r\n\r\nI hope you understand that my request stems from a desire for efficiency and accessibility, as well as considerations of compliance with legal standards regarding accessibility and data management.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the convenience the portal offers, I believe it should supplement rather than replace traditional methods of communication.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to arrange for the records to be delivered via email or another conventional means? I want to ensure a smooth and accessible process for both parties involved.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for your understanding and cooperation. Please let me know if there are any further steps I need to take on my end.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nEvan Rees\r\nMuckRock News",
