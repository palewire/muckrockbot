Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, relevant state court cases have established the importance of transparency and the public interest in accessing such records. In Doe v. Karpa, 524 N.Y.S.2d 176 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988), the court recognized the public's right to access records related to police misconduct. Similarly, in Schreiber v. City of Potsdam, 637 N.Y.S.2d 148 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996), the court affirmed the public's interest in obtaining records regarding law enforcement actions.\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Therefore, I kindly request a fee waiver for the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: +1 845-218-0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.
