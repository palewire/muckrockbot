On January 23, 2025, the Office properly extended the time to respond to your request by five (5) business days to January 31, 2025.  Your Request seeks the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A copy of every administrative subpoena received by [the Office] from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and/or the Department of Homeland Security between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2022.\r\n  2.  A copy of all email or mailed communications sent to or received from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and/or the Department of Homeland Security that pertains to administrative subpoenas received between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2022.\r\n\r\nThe Office has conducted a reasonably diligent search of its physical and electronic databases and has identified certain responsive records to your Request within its possession and custody.  The responsive record is attached with this correspondence.  However, the Office has redacted certain exempt information contained within the responsive records pursuant to applicable FOIA exemptions.  The Office\u2019s factual basis for this partial denial of your request is detailed below.\r\n\r\nThe Office has redacted unique identifiers, including social security numbers; driver\u2019s license numbers; and signatures (Ill. Att\u2019y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 14-015, issued March 25, 2014, at 11) from the responsive record pursuant to FOIA exemption 7(1)(b), which expressly exempts private information from disclosure.  5 ILCS 140/2(c-5); 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\r\n\r\nThe disclosure of the following information is a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and therefore the Office is withholding the following information: date of birth (IIl. Att\u2019y Gen. Pub. Acc. Op. No. 16-0098, issued November 7, 2016, at 12); other third-party names, for instance, the names of suspected who were never arrested and of other persons referenced incidentally in reports, such as relatives or neighbors (Ill. Att\u2019y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 31526, issued November 26, 2014, at 6).  5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c).\r\n\r\nNote:  You have the right to have any denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (\u201cPAC\u201d) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General.  5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).  You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to:  Public Access Counselor, Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd St., Springfield, IL 62701, (877) 299-3642, public.access@ilag.gov<mailto:public.access@ilag.gov>.  5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

This includes predictive models and ADSs built in-house as well as those built by vendors for the agency or those used by agency employees through third-party software.\r\n\r\n2) All contracts and statements of work regarding the purchase and/or creation of tools identified in response to part one of this request.\r\n\r\n2) A data dictionary/library for each predictive model and ADS identified in response to part one of this request. Please note: Data dictionaries list the names of data fields (i.e. column headers in a spreadsheet), they do not contain the actual data analyzed by models.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this request, please don't hesitate to contact me for further clarification.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of responsive documents, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

External portals or platforms requiring login credentials are inaccessible to me and must not be used.\r\nAccessible Formats: Any records or documents provided must be in screen-reader-compatible PDF formats, with plain-text summaries where necessary.\r\nConfirmation of Compliance\r\nPlease confirm in writing that all future correspondence will adhere strictly to the accommodations outlined above.\r\n\r\nThe lack of identifying information in your correspondence is deeply concerning and contradicts the standards of accountability and transparency outlined in FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552). Furthermore, failure to address my accommodation requests creates barriers to my access rights and violates federal disability rights laws.\r\n\r\nIf I do not receive a full response, including the identification of the responsible individual(s) and confirmation of compliance with ADA requirements, within five (5) business days (by January 3, 2025), I will have no choice but to escalate this matter. Such escalation will include filing formal complaints with the following entities:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (ADA enforcement)\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (FOIA oversight)\r\nRelevant congressional oversight committees\r\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\r\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands\r\nWithin five (5) business days, I require:\r\n\r\nFull name and title of the individual(s) responsible for prior responses regarding FOIA #F-2025-06600.\r\nDirect contact information, including email and telephone number, for future communications.\r\nEscalation Notice\r\nFailure to provide this information by January 3, 2025, will result in:\r\n\r\nFormal complaints to the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) for FOIA violations.\r\nADA compliance escalation to the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division.\r\nNotification to Congressional oversight committees responsible for FOIA and ADA compliance.\r\nI trust that your office will take immediate corrective action to address this issue and fulfill the obligations of transparency and accessibility under federal law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources",

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G.

Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Please note that although the Medicaid program is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, each individual state is responsible for administering the operations of their Medicaid program. CMS is not in possession of Medicaid claims records, and therefore we are unable to provide these state records. Therefore, after a careful search of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) files, i.e., a search reasonably calculated to locate records responsive to your request and employing reasonable standards, we were unable to locate any records responsive to your request.If you view our response as an adverse determination, you may appeal. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing and mail it within 30 days of the date of this letter to: The Principal Deputy Administrator, CMS, C5-16-03, 7500 Security Boulevard,Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850.

Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the\r\nfoundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal\r\nmandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can\r\novercome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.\r\n\r\nAmericans living with disabilities and their families are Americans\u2014full citizens of this nation, protected by the same Constitution that guarantees the rights and freedoms of every individual. We are not separate, lesser, or forgotten. We are Americans with the same unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nWe stand firmly on the principles of equality, dignity, and justice. Our voices matter. Our contributions matter. And our rights\u2014our Constitutional rights\u2014must be respected, upheld, and protected without exception or delay.\r\n\r\nWe are Americans with rights.

Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Please note that although the Medicaid program is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, each individual state is responsible for administering the operations of their Medicaid program. CMS is not in possession of Medicaid claims records, and therefore we are unable to provide these state records. Therefore, after a careful search of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) files, i.e., a search reasonably calculated to locate records responsive to your request and employing reasonable standards, we were unable to locate any records responsive to your request.If you view our response as an adverse determination, you may appeal. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing and mail it within 30 days of the date of this letter to: The Principal Deputy Administrator, CMS, C5-16-03, 7500 Security Boulevard,Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850.

Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the\r\nfoundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal\r\nmandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can\r\novercome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.\r\n\r\nAmericans living with disabilities and their families are Americans\u2014full citizens of this nation, protected by the same Constitution that guarantees the rights and freedoms of every individual. We are not separate, lesser, or forgotten. We are Americans with the same unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nWe stand firmly on the principles of equality, dignity, and justice. Our voices matter. Our contributions matter. And our rights\u2014our Constitutional rights\u2014must be respected, upheld, and protected without exception or delay.\r\n\r\nWe are Americans with rights.

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Please note that although the Medicaid program is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, each individual state is responsible for administering the operations of their Medicaid program. CMS is not in possession of Medicaid claims records, and therefore we are unable to provide these state records. Therefore, after a careful search of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) files, i.e., a search reasonably calculated to locate records responsive to your request and employing reasonable standards, we were unable to locate any records responsive to your request.If you view our response as an adverse determination, you may appeal. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing and mail it within 30 days of the date of this letter to: The Principal Deputy Administrator, CMS, C5-16-03, 7500 Security Boulevard,Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850.

By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal\r\nmandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can\r\novercome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.\r\n\r\nAmericans living with disabilities and their families are Americans\u2014full citizens of this nation, protected by the same Constitution that guarantees the rights and freedoms of every individual.

This review includes determining whether any information should be withheld from disclosure under the exemptions set forth in NY Public Officers Law section 87(2).  I note that any emails or attachments which include proprietary, confidential, or business sensitive information are required to undergo an additional review by ICF as set forth in NY Public Officers Law section 89(5).  This additional review entails NYSERDA seeking a confidentiality justification letter from ICF, ICF reviewing each responsive email and attachment sent to it and drafting a letter to NYSERDA with its confidentiality assertions.\r\n\r\nGiven this, NYSERDA anticipates completing its review of the responsive records no later than August 30.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nColleen Dawson\r\nSenior Counsel\r\n\r\nNYSERDA\r\n17 Columbia Circle | Albany, NY 12203-6399\r\nP: 518-862-1090 ext. 3454 | C: 518-928-7510 | Email: Colleen.Dawson@nyserda.ny.gov<mailto:Colleen.Dawson@nyserda.ny.gov>\r\nnyserda.ny.gov<http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/>\r\nfollow : friend : connect with NYSERDA<http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/Social-Media>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0]\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0]<https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About>  [cid:image003.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGqdNxvmqT0>\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon.\r\n\r\nFor this event shot by the WHTV Unit you do not need to file a FOIA request\r\nto review the material. Pre request, the event has been placed onto the\r\nClintonLibrary42 YouTube channel. The event has been placed at the\r\nfollowing link; [ President Clinton at Rally in Seattle, WA (1994) - YouTube\r\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj80HXnGg-8> ]. It may not immediately be\r\navailable for viewing, and if that is the case please allow a little bit of\r\ntime for it to be encoded for YouTube playback.\r\n\r\nThe event was adjusted to match the title assigned by the Federal Register\r\nand as printed by the Government Printing Office. The original title on the\r\narchived WhiteHouse.gov webpage was a press office assigned title prior to\r\nthe event entering the Federal Register.\r\n\r\nThis event consisted of two main taps and a roving camera. All three of the\r\nclips were included which encompasses the entirety of your request. There\r\nwas no further material from the Pike Place Market event.\r\n\r\nThere was a transition point in the footage of MT02990 to MT02991 at\r\napproximately 29:11 in the footage. As the material was originally shot on\r\n30 minute Betacam format there was a practical limitation of having two\r\ncameras run side-by-side to ensure all of the President's remarks were\r\ncaptured for record. Where appropriate we try to splice these transition\r\npoints together so they are seamless and to align better with what\r\nresearchers expect video to look like. I believe we got pretty close there\r\nwith the seam point. The first tape MT02990 was also observed to have high\r\nincoming audio levels from the Mult. It was adjusted to match MT02991's\r\nlevel which is more proper for the event's setting and not as distorted.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any immediate questions.\r\n\r\n- Herbert\r\n\r\nHerbert Ragan\r\n*Audio/Visual Archivist / **National Archives and Records\r\nAdministration / **William\r\nJ.

        "communication": "Dear Joe Meadors,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request dated\r\nJanuary 12, 2025 for records relating to death certificates for individuals\r\nthat were killed in action on the USS Liberty on the approximate dates of\r\nJune 1967. Your request was received in this office, A2 Textual Reference,\r\non the date of January 16, 2024 and assigned FOIA case number 25-20011.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have conducted a records review for Appendix C for the Court of Inquiry\r\nfor the USS Liberty in relation to the attack on the USS Liberty that\r\noccurred on June 8, 1967. During our records review we reviewed Record\r\nGroup 125: Records of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General. Unfortunately,\r\nwe were unable to locate a copy of this record. These records may remain\r\nwith the U.S. Navy's Judge advocate general. We did locate a scanned copy\r\nof this document online. This copy is held on the website The Liberty\r\nIncident (http://www.thelibertyincident.com/docs/courtofinquiry.pdf) Please\r\nnote that the identified website is not an official source of U.S.\r\nGovernment records, however, we have included the link for reference and\r\nnote that Appendix C can be located on page 47 of that document.\r\nAdditionally, we have attached a copy of Appendix C as it appears in that\r\ndocument. Appendix C appears to be a name list of those killed in action.\r\nWe recommend contacting the website www.thelibertyincident.com to determine\r\nthe origin of the source for the copy of the Court of Inquiry they retain\r\non their website. They may be able to identify the Agency or Office within\r\nthe U.S. Navy that currently holds the original records and they may be\r\nable to determine if copies of the Death Certificates were included with\r\nthe original Court of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring our records review we did locate files that may be relevant to your\r\nresearch. These records were located in the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nRecord Group 24: Records of the U.S. Navy Bureau of Personnel\r\n\r\nSeries Title: Miscellaneous Casualty Records, 1941-1971\r\n\r\nBox Numbers: 9 & 10\r\n\r\nFile Title: USS Liberty, 8 June 1967, 34 Crewmembers Dead (8 June 1967-9\r\nFebruary 1970)\r\n\r\nFile Title: USS Liberty \u2013 Incoming Messages & Notifications \u2013 MIA & Dead,\r\n1967 (1 of 2) (June 1967)\r\nFile Title: USS Liberty \u2013 Incoming Messages & Notifications \u2013 MIA & Dead,\r\n1967 (2 of 2) (June 1967)\r\nFile Title: USS Liberty \u2013 Incoming Messages & Notifications \u2013 Injured, 1967\r\n(10 June-1 July 1967)\r\n\r\nThe above materials are already open for public viewing in our research\r\nroom at the National Archives in College Park, MD, located at 8601 Adelphi\r\nRoad, College Park, MD. We are staffed to assist researchers with their\r\nwork by providing onsite reference services. Since there are no access\r\nrestrictions on these documents, there is no need to file a Freedom of\r\nInformation Act request with the National Archives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be happy to make the records and their finding aids available to\r\nyou or your representative in the Textual Research Room (Room 2000) here at\r\nthe National Archives at College Park, Maryland. Please visit our website\r\nfor information about visiting the National Archives in College Park, MD\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/college-park>, including how to schedule a\r\nresearch visit. If you are unable to visit our research reading rooms you\r\nmay consider hiring a private researcher to conduct research on your\r\nbehalf. The scope of your research, combined with our staffing limitations\r\nmay make this the most efficient way to provide you with professional\r\nresearch services. A list of private researchers who are familiar with\r\nNational Archives facilities is available on our Independent Researchers\r\nAvailable for Hire <https://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help> webpage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request. We do not consider this a\r\ndenial of your FOIA request. If you are not satisfied with our action on\r\nthis request, your options for appeal and dispute resolution are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have a follow up request please send your request to\r\narchives2reference@nara.gov. We hope you find this information useful in\r\nconducting your research.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJACOB A.

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request #1412777-000 for FBI records concerning File 062-HQ-62736, Postal Censorship.  The FBI has located approximately 83,000 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 523 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,335 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,875 days for processing.  \r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is June 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please respond to this email.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-4894\r\nStatus check?

I am appealing all applied exemptions in the records provided, particularly the application of b7e to records that are, at the time of my receiving them, eighty-three years old. The Bureau has previously disclosed law enforcement and intelligence techniques of this era, to include the interception of privileged diplomatic communications and collaboration with allied foreign intelligence services, methods that at the time would be highly damaging if disclosed but currently hold no value by remaining secret. The exemptions as applied in this release strain credulity and are prima facie absurd. I appreciate your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPaul Galante",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

You are seeking records pertaining to all FOIA requests made to the ICE FOIA office since November 5, 2024.. \r\n\r\nThese documents are located at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement website at https://www.ice.gov/foia-category/ice-foia-logs. \r\n**Please note that November and December 2024 FOIA requests are currently being worked on and will be posted soon. \r\n\r\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nChristina Martinez \r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission is in receipt of your request under the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law (RTKL). You requested, \"any records reflecting a complaint, charge, or disciplinary action concerning any violation (or alleged violation) of scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy.  Any records reflecting any warning issued to any employee concerning the scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy.  Any policy, guidance, regulation, or handbook concerning the scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy.  This request is limited to records generated on or after May 5, 2024.\"  A complete copy of your request is below for your ease of reference.\r\n\r\nYour request is denied, in-part, and granted, in-part, as described below.\r\n\r\nYour request is denied, in-part, as the RTKL provides that certain investigative records are exempt from public access or disclosure.  For example, a record of an agency relating to a non-criminal investigation is exempt from disclosure. See, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(17); and, Pennsylvania Game Comm'n v. Fennell, 149 A.3d 101 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016) (holding complaints submitted to agency non-public).  The non-criminal investigative exemption covers, \"[i]nvestigative materials, notes, correspondence, and reports; and, a record that, if disclosed, would...reveal the institution, progress, or result of an agency investigation.\"  65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.708(b)(17)(ii) and 67.708(b)(17)(vi)(A).  Therefore, to the extent any documents concerning the above-referenced matter(s) exists, such records are investigatory and the request is denied.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your request is denied, in-part, as written criticisms of an employee; grievance material, including documents related to discrimination or sexual harassment; and information regarding discipline, demotion or discharge contained in a personnel file are exempt from disclosure.  See, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.708(b)(7)(vi)(vii)(viii).\r\n\r\nAlthough records of a final action from an agency that results in a demotion or discharge are presumed public, the PGC performed an extensive search of its systems and determined it does not have records of a final action that resulted in a demotion or discharge for any violation of the scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy. The PGC does not possess these records.\r\n\r\nYour request is granted in the remainder.  Attached hereto, please find one (1) responsive record.  I have also provided three (3) links below for your reference.\r\n\r\nCriminal Conduct | Human Resources | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<https://www.pa.gov/agencies/hrmoa/programs/employee-relations/criminal-conduct.html#:~:text=The%20Governor%27s%20Code%20of%20Conduct,must%20be%20suspended%20without%20pay.>\r\n\r\nDiscipline | Human Resources | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<https://www.pa.gov/agencies/hrmoa/programs/employee-relations/discipline.html>\r\n\r\nEmployee Relations Policies and Laws | Human Resources | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<https://www.pa.gov/agencies/hrmoa/programs/employee-relations/policies-laws.html>\r\n\r\nPlease know that you have the right to appeal this response by writing to the Office of Open Records, 333 Market Street, 16th Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17101-2234.  Should you wish to file an appeal you must do so within fifteen (15) days of the mailing date of the agency's response.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nZachary Fahnestock\r\nAgency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Chief Counsel\r\nPennsylvania Game Commission\r\n2001 Elmerton Avenue\r\nHarrisburg, PA 17110",
