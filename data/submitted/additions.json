Alternatively, please consider waiving any fees, pursuant to \u00a7 4-206(e)(2)(ii) of the General Provisions Article, as this request is on behalf of individuals served by the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, a state government agency, which solely serves indigent citizens of Maryland.  As a result, my request for the above-listed public records is in the public interest.  I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

As of March 6, 0225 the following links were active to documents (at least one in .PDF format) containing multiple pages of admissions, applications and enrollment data that VMI removed from the site so they are no longer accessible: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/oie/VMI-Enrollment-Details.pdf\r\n\r\nIn addition to this specific document, all files in this root directory as of March 6, 2025 should be available:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/oie/\r\n\r\nThis page also had links to registration data that is not longer available:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.vmi.edu/academics/support/registrar/registration-and-enrollment/\r\n\r\nGoven these documents exist and were publically available as of March 6, 2025 there is not reason they cannot be provided expeditiously so no extension to the 5 day limit is justifiable. In addition, since these documents existed in those two directories and especially in https://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/oie/ a charge to search for documents does not appear to be justified.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
