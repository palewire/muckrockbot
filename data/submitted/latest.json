Based upon an initial review of your request, and an estimate of what is required to complete it, this agency has determined that it will be unable to respond to your request in full within the next twenty (20) business days.  The reasons we cannot process your request within the next twenty (20) business days include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The volume of the requests we received prior to yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The work needed to process said requests,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that this agency processes requests in the order in which they are received,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The anticipated size of the files from which you have requested records,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that the records you requested may not be contained within a single, readily identifiable, on-site source, and, most significantly,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that this Office\u2019s Records Access Officers (RAOs), are still tackling a Covid-related backlog of FOIL requests that accrued over a two-year period wherein, due to limited on-site staffing, we were unable to access our physical files.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, you can expect a determination on or about May 5, 2023,  which date is \u201creasonable under the circumstances of (your) request(s).\u201d within the meaning of Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a).  See Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454, 465 (2007) ([T]ime needed to comply with a request may be dependent on a number of factors, including the volume of the request and the retrieval methods.  Compliance with FOIL request may require substantial time and may not require agency to provide such records in a time other than that which is reasonable in view of the attendant circumstances).  In the determination any statutorily authorized fees incurred in processing your request will be listed.  These fees must be paid before this agency will release any records.  Pub Off. L. \u00a7 87(1)(b)(iii).\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive a determination by that the date set forth above, please do not hesitate to contact us.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nA copy of an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, \"Superstitions and Black Magic\". The report was issued by the OSS's Morale Operations (MO) branch sometime between January 1, 1943 and September 20, 1945, and dealt with the exploitation of superstition in psychological operations targeting the Axis powers of the Greater German Reich, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire of Japan. During the period between the creation of MO and the dissolution of the OSS, officers planned and/or carried out propaganda campaigns utilizing superstition as a key vector of attack; for reference, please see Operations Fantasia and Hermit in the Pacific Theater and OSS collaboration with Great Britain's Special Operations Executive in the promotion of German astrologist Louis de Wohl. This report is of public interest because it clarifies how the OSS overcame similar propaganda campaigns waged by the Greater German Reich during World War II.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation this request will interfere with any ongoing operations, nor should it reveal any current trade or defense secrets. The aforementioned operations occurred over 70 years ago, and the OSS ceased all operations in September of 1945.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Creem Magazine, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
