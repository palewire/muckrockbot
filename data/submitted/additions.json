        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe decisions issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals between October 20, 2020, and the date of processing of this request, arising from cases decided by the following IJs: \r\n\r\n1. Theresa Holmes-Simmons\r\n\r\n2. Scott D. Criss\r\n\r\n3. Stephanie Gorman\r\n\r\n4. Rodger C. Harris \r\n\r\n5. Amy Lee\r\n\r\n6. Maria Lopez-Enriquez\r\n\r\n7. Jeffrey R. Nance\r\n\r\n8. George W. Riggs\r\n\r\nTo be clear, these are cases that were classified at the BIA as either administratively closed, background check remand, and/or remand. I REQUEST THAT THE DECISIONS BE DELIVERED IN SEPARATE FOLDERS ACCORDING TO THE IJ THAT ISSUED THE UNDERLYING DECISION (that is, one folder with all of the remands from each IJ, please). \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this request is to help gather information, to provide to the public, about why the Charlotte Immigration Court has a much higher-than-average asylum denial rate compared to other non-detained immigration courts in the Fourth Circuit and what the reasoning has been when the BIA has overturned some of those denials. See TRAC, \u201cAsylum Decisions Vary Widely Across Judges and Courts - Latest Results,\u201d (Jan. 13, 2020), available at https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/590/.\r\n\r\nThe requested records will be made available to the general public via  a FOIA records clearinghouse (www.muckrock.com), and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am an attorney at a non-profit organization, CAIR Coalition (https://www.caircoalition.org/staff-directory). Thus, I request that fees be waived. However, in the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the response be provided electronically, by e-mail attachment if available, or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nF. Evan Benz, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
