        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Al Otro Lado and its #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, we request all currently effective IHSC Staffing Requirements for ICE facilities based on detention standard (NDS, PBNDS 2011, NDS 2019). \r\n\r\nWe request updated versions of the two matrices ICE previously supplied in response to a FOIA request. Those matrices were from May 2018. We are requesting the most recent version  of these documents. \r\n\r\nThis request seeks 3 tables. It is straightforward and requires a search of only a single custodian: ICE-ERO-IHSC. In the event a search of IHSC turns up nothing, we request an alternative search ERO-CMD, OAQ, and OCFO. \r\n\r\nWe suggest an adequate search would include the terms \u201cIHSC Minimum Staffing Requirements by Facility Size.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask that the agency designate this request for Simple Track Processing.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that our project, the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative of Al Otro Lado, recently secured a partial judgment on the pleadings and a declaratory judgment in the US District Court for the Central District of California that ICE engaged in an unlawful pattern and practice of violating FOIA\u2019s timing provisions. Owen v ICE, No 2022cv550 (CD Cal Jan. 12, 2023) (copy available here: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23689456/owen-v-ice-cd-cal-pattern-practice-declaratory-judgment.pdf.  We sincerely hope that the agency will heed the Owen Court\u2019s admonitions that FOIA\u2019s \u201c\u2018deadlines are not aspirational \u2014 Congress set them and expected compliance\u2019 and an \u2018agency does not have the authority to ignore unambiguous deadlines set by Congress[.\u2019]\u201d Id at 15.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide this records and carry out all mandatory actions within the timeframes Congress required.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of the following memorandums:\r\n\r\n1. \"Flying Saucer Type of Planes\", from Todos M. Odarenko to H. Marshall Chadwell, dated May 25, 1954;\r\n\r\n2. \"USAF Project Y\", from Frederic C. E. Oder to Todos M. Odarenko, dated May 21, 1954.\r\n\r\nBoth memos are referenced in a study written by National Reconnaissance Office historian Gerald K. Haines, \"CIA's Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-90\", first published by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in \"Studies in Intelligence\" in 1997. Mr. Haines cites the memos in the end notes, under note 41, in reference to Project Y, a flying saucer-like aircraft created by a Canadian manufacturer, A. V. Roe Canada. A third memorandum included as part of this note, \"Intelligence Responsibilities for Non-Conventional Types of Air Vehicles\", is already accessible in the Electronic Reading Room on the CIA's website (https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000015367.pdf). As such, I am requesting the release of the other two records, as they do not appear to be publicly accessible on the CIA's website, reproduced on reliable third-party sites like The Internet Archive or The Black Vault, or available via other means, online or off.\r\n\r\nThere is sufficient cause to believe there is public interest in these records. Countless stories have been written about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), colloquially identified as flying saucers or UFOs, since 2017. In December of that year, the New York Times published a story, titled \"Glowing Auras and \u2018Black Money\u2019: The Pentagon\u2019s Mysterious U.F.O. Program\", about a government research program known as the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Subsequent coverage of UAP and AATIP has appeared in The New Yorker, Washington Post, and other mainstream news outlets. Therefore, records on the government's historical relationship with this kind of research would contribute to the public's understanding of the UAP issue.\r\n\r\nThere should be no concerns over national security or a need to protect trade secrets. Project Y, later known as the Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar, was discontinued in 1961. Additionally, all individuals mentioned herein, including Todos M. Odarenko, H. Marshall Chadwell, and Frederic C. E. Oder, are deceased: Dr. Odarenko passed on July 7, 1975; Dr. Chadwell on June 3, 1980; and Col. Oder on May 11, 2006.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, and my bylines include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law\r\n\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nkatherine stathulis",
