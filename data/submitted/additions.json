The caller reported that the driver, later identified as Haley Ferguson, appeared to be intoxicated and a small child was with her. The footage of the initial interaction with Haley wasn\u2019t released because the juvenile could be seen in it. Therefore, we have begun the video from the time that the officer conducts sobriety tests on Haley. Haley was then arrested because of reasonable suspicion of DUI. Haley was charged with OWI (3rd offence), Resisting an officer and misdemeanor bail jumping.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMark D Nickelson",
