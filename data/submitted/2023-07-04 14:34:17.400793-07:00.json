The FPS 2 develops models to identify fraud waste and abuse and monitor the models to validate effective alerting.\r\n\r\nI am seeking:\r\n\r\n1) Contracts, memorandums of understanding, and statements of work between the department and any outside party regarding the implementation and development of FPS2 of any service to detect or predict fraud\r\n\r\n2) Documentation of FPS 2 or predictive models that the agency currently uses (including those used as aids to human decision making). This documentation should include, where available: executive summaries of the algorithm/model's purpose, lists of the data sources, breakdowns of how the model weights various input data, descriptions of the statistical or machine learning techniques employed, the results of validation and accuracy testing, disparate impact studies, and algorithmic impact reports.\r\n\r\n3) A data dictionary/library for each predictive or detection model or algorithm identified in response to items 1 and 2 of this requests.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of any internal or independent audits of the identified models or algorithms.\r\n\r\n5) Aggregate or disaggregated data, if any exists, breaking down the risk scores or outputs of the fraud model.\r\n\r\n6) Training data code and model files for the above algorithms.\r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of information regarding the use of predictive analytics will contribute significantly to public understanding of how CMS uses advanced machine learning technology. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory\r\nexemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to\r\nonly a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and\r\nprovide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me or call\r\nme. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under the provisions of the Freedom of Information\r\nAct (5 U.S.C. Section 552).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Bat, mascot for Carlsbad Caverns National Park.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design/re-design of the Carl S. Bat mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to NPS's decision to create a mascot for Carlsbad Caverns in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Carl S. Bat-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Carl S. Bat costumes. (The attached screenshots from NPS's social media suggest that Carl's costume got an update sometime between 2014 and 2022, so please produce records for the different versions.) Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Carl S. Bat.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Carl S. Bat (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007, and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some around 2019. \r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using Carl S. Bat as part of NPS's public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
