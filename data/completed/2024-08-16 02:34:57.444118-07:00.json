Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",

Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter; \r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter; RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024; \r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office has reviewed your request with the CPS Office of Student Support and Engagement and the CPS School Administration & Health Services Team and has been advised that the information you seek is not comprehensively tracked centrally in the regular course of business. Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools. As such, this information is not centrally tracked or can be counted. In order to provide you with information responsive to your request, a FOIA Officer would have to go to each school to conduct a search and create a new record which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, creating records and answering questions is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders. \r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Georgia Open Records Act \u00a7 50.18.70 et seq.,. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Below is a copy of the original request language:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of all guidelines, protocols, training materials, educational materials, and screening or diagnostic materials used by the university\u2019s athletics department related to the prevention of disordered eating, identification of student-athletes at risk of developing disordered eating, and establishing a chain of reporting for a student-athlete flagged as at risk for developing or exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating. Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders.\r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available.\r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Georgia Open Records Act \u00a7 50.18.70 et seq.,. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.\r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNarimes Parakul",

We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA2456.D092CD00][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

We have reviewed your request and wanted to follow up with more information, as well as to get direction from you about how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with state law and our policy and procedures regarding public access to University information (both linked below), there is a threshold of staff time beyond which time spent collecting and copying responsive records is charged to the requester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we are often able to search a single inbox for a select date range and keywords, conducting this search across 17 months of Dr. Urriola's inbox will put us over the threshold I mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to proceed with this request, as currently written, we would need to collect a $100 deposit. Should the final cost be above or below this deposit total, we would follow up with you before releasing the data to detail any balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said, it's also our understanding that Dr. Urriola's contributions do not generally involve the communications aspects of this work. It is quite possible that, should you pay the costs associated with collecting 17 months of data, that there will be little or no responsive data at the end of that search. We won't know for certain until we conduct a search for these records, but I wanted to be upfront about that possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in refining this search to reduce potential costs, which would primarily involve reducing the timeframe you've identified, I'd be happy to discuss that as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you'd like to proceed with this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nJake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks referenced above:\r\n\r\nhttps://policy.umn.edu/operations/publicaccess\r\n\r\nhttps://policy.umn.edu/operations/publicaccess-proc01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at University of Minnesota.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Unfortunately, the payment information you uploaded shows that payment is not made out to the correct contact and we will not be able to process it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my June 19 message, I shared that the check for payment must be made out to the University of Minnesota Board of Regents and marked with your request number (Ref No. 24-751). The payment you've uploaded specifically names an University employee and our Office of General Counsel. Again, we will not be able to process this payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot keep this request open and idle for several more weeks while this payment situation is resolved. If you are willing to pay directly or can get payment sent promptly through other means, we can hold the request into next week while we wait for that payment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are going to need to get the payment cancelled and reissued through Muck Rock, we will close the request and ask that you refile it once you've worked out the payment information with Muck Rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nJake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at University of Minnesota.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39. If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

The Normal track is for requests that can be processed in six to twenty workdays. The Complex track is for requests that can be processed in twenty-one to sixty workdays. The Exceptional/Voluminous track is for requests requiring more than sixty workdays for processing. The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing. Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nThis request falls into the Complex track.\r\n\r\nWe normally process requests on a first-in, first-out basis, however, due to the nature of your request and the circumstances surrounding this request, we will prioritize and process your request as the records become available. Please know that the Bureau\u2019s Management is very committed to providing responses to FOIA requests and remedying the FOIA backlog.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at BLM_WO_FOIA@blm.gov. Thank you for your interest in public lands and in programs and activities of the BLM.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:30a47f1d-a3b3-47fc-bb83-7b41916a62fa]",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",

For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is 1590533-000. \r\n\r\nWe reviewed the 3 pages that the FBI sent us.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \r\n\r\nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C).  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).\u00a0 Exemption 7(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0 The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.\u00a0 The public interest under Exemption 7(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party.\u00a0 In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA, but rather, would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.

        "communication": "Greetings,\r\n\r\nThis message is in regards to request  2024-FPRO-01665.\r\n\r\nMy request, filed April 29, 2024, was for \u201cAll feedback on the USPS plan to move processing operations from Reno, NV to Sacramento , CA that was collected in February 2024 via \u201cSurvey Monkey\u201d survey with the URL \u201chttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/mpfr-reno-nv\u201c\r\n\r\nYour amended fee estimate of May 23, 2024 categorized my request as from an \"other requester\" as justification for a fee assessment of  a minimum $140.70. I am appealing that  amended fee estimate. \r\n\r\nI believe I qualify as an educational and/or media requester, and for that reason the fees should be waived. My initial request did not specify my status. I am a journalism professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and this request was part of a public records class I teach. I will use this request, the appeal and communications related to it, and any documents obtained, in teaching that class. The records obtained will likely be used as part of public interest news media reporting--by students or other professional news media--on the USPS decision to move mail processing from Reno, NV to Sacramento, CA. I may also use this request and communications related to it in my academic research on public records. \r\n\r\nAs evidence of my status as an educational and/or media requester, you can view my professional bio and profile here: https://www.unr.edu/journalism/faculty-and-staff/directory/file-patrick. A description of the course I teach is here: https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2019/rsj-public-records-course. Some of my academic research on public records requests is here: https://journals.flvc.org/civic/article/view/119008\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this appeal.\r\n\r\nPatrick File\r\n",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to \"Filegate\", which arose in June 1996 around improper White House access in 1993 and 1994 to Federal Bureau of Investigation security-clearance documents. Access to the files, allegedly without permission, was given to Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, with estimates ranging from 400 to 900 unauthorized file disclosures.\r\n\r\nI request that processing be expedited, as there is widespread interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence. This is especially relevant given the upcoming election, in which Hillary Clinton (suspected by some of wrongdoing in 'Filegate') is a candidate. I certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I request that fees be waived, as the documents will be used to facilitate news stories which enhance the public's understanding of the government's handling of alleged wrongdoing. The documents will also be made available through the nonprofit Internet Archive's national security collection. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nI'm contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Filegate. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 2893 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  I can be reached via email at rbronson@fbi.gov, or you may call me at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRebecca Bronson\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\n540-868-1695",

I am writing to follow up on my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted to your office on March 17, 2024. The request pertains to: digital communications about a meeting with Aguada residents that took place on May 11, 2024 about their concerns over levee placements along the Madre Vieja channel.\r\n\r\nThe request also pertained to instructional materials, presentations, and presentation materials used to prepare for or used during the May 11 meeting with Aguada residents.\r\n\r\nAs of today, July 12, 2024, I have not received any response or communication regarding the status of my request. According to the FOIA regulations (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)), agencies are generally required to respond to FOIA requests within 20 business days from the date of receipt. It has now been well beyond that timeframe without any communication or indication of the status of my request.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the FOIA provides for legal remedies in cases of agency non-compliance, including the right to seek judicial review if an agency fails to respond to a FOIA request within the statutory time frame. While I hope to resolve this matter amicably and swiftly, I must insist on prompt action to fulfill my request or provide a specific explanation for any delay.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate update on the status of my request and an estimated timeline for when I can expect to receive the responsive records. If there are any issues or additional information needed to process my request, please do not hesitate to contact me at 787-449-4731 or carlosBP@protonmail.com.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",

In\r\nshort, though: your request, as is, may qualify for a 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut it does not qualify for a fee waiver. To qualify for a fee waiver, the\r\nrequest, among other things, must be narrowly tailored to preserve public\r\nresources, which it is not as it seeks records from a two year period from\r\nroughly 90 offices. Speaking more frankly, I can also tell you that a\r\nsearch in our e-mail records collection tool of \u201cfair work week\u201d\r\nunfortunately won\u2019t only return hits with \u201cfair work week\u201d -- it will\r\nreturn anything with \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d or \u201cweek\u201d in it, which I\u2019m sure you\r\ncan imagine will create countless (likely many thousands of) records that\r\nare not responsive to your request and that will need to be sorted through\r\nbefore we can provide you with the records that are responsive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to read through the attached policy and can confirm that\r\nyour request meets all of the qualifications for a fee reduction, I can\r\nproceed with the request as is and will grant you the 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut would ask for your patience as this request will take months of work to\r\ncomplete. I am also happy to work with you to help you reconfigure your\r\nrequest to be more specific (for example, by narrowing the search window,\r\nor seeking records from fewer offices) so that we can grant that full fee\r\nwaiver. If we do proceed with a fee reduction only, I will make sure to\r\ncommunicate a fee estimate before we actually begin processing your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed once you\u2019ve had a chance\r\nto read through the attached policy document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Michael Burns *|* Legal and Public Records Assistant*\r\n\r\nOffice of the Legislative Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice: 503.986.1243\r\n\r\n[image: http://intranet/CapitolImages/Oregon%20State%20Seal%20-%20Color.jpg]",

I am surprised to learn that your\r\ncollection tool does not allow for compound search terms or operators (e.g.\r\nfair AND work AND week). One way of working around this limitation might be\r\nto narrow the keyword search to certain fields, e.g. the email subject or\r\nattachment file name. Another possibility would be to search for records\r\ncontaining relevant bill numbers (SB878, SB888) instead of common words.\r\nBut I'm not sure if you can search specific fields or metadata of these\r\nemails. I would appreciate any further information or assistance you could\r\nprovide in tailoring my request.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nPeter",

        "communication": "Hi Peter,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad you asked, because it gave me an opportunity to check in with the team that pulls e-mails for us (our IT folks are the ones who pull the records, while we review, redact, and discuss/disseminate them with/to the various concerned parties.) What they told me is that compound search terms with operators do (read: should) work, and that if I am seeing results that contradict that we can investigate why. Since I frequently see evidence to the contrary, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to review with them the next time the issue comes up. It\u2019s quite possible that user error (i.e. using operators in lower case instead of all caps) yielded nonresponsive records in the past. Thankfully we do always find the correct records (assuming they exist)... we just tend to end up with a lot of separating the wheat from the chaff, which isn\u2019t practical for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe tool they use, by the way, is Office 365 eDiscovery. It doesn\u2019t allow you to limit what fields you\u2019re searching in, but if you\u2019re curious, this<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-keyword-queries-and-search-conditions?view=o365-worldwide> article discusses the ins-and-outs of how to use it.\r\n\r\nAs for your current request: really, I can limit it however you\u2019d like. The goal here is to make sure you are getting the records you want and are entitled to, so I\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re doing it right. I\u2019ll just need you to specify the conditions so I\u2019m not misinterpreting anything. We can use your original search terms, and can also add SB###, SB ###, Senate Bill ###, etc. to the list of terms. The search will find hits in both e-mails and attachments. The biggest issue remains the number of accounts you\u2019re asking us to pull records from, and the best advice I can offer is to limit your search to members of the Legislative Assembly and committees that actually worked on whichever bills you\u2019re interested in. You\u2019ll need to do the research on that if that\u2019s a route you\u2019d like to take, but OLIS<https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/previous-session-bills.aspx> is a great place to start.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll await further correspondence. Have a great day in the meantime.\r\n\r\nMichael",

I would like to add the bill number (828) as an alternate search term.
