This is to include any analysts' notes made during the processing of the requests, any standard worksheets completed by the analysts, any justifications for exemption invocations or other supporting documentation provided to the Appeals Authority, and any correspondence referencing the requests, including tasking orders, emails, and coordination documentation. However, any records previously released to the original requesters in unredacted form may be excluded from this request. Additionally, please provide the initial request letters for the 5 oldest open FOIA/PA requests.\r\n\r\nWhen processing this request, please note that the D.C. Circuit has previously held that agencies have a duty to construe the subject material of FOIA requests liberally to ensure responsive records are not overlooked. See Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau v. U.S. Customs Service, 71 F.3d 885, 890 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Accordingly, you are hereby instructed that the term \u201crecord\u201d includes, but is not limited to: 1) all email communications to or from any individual within your agency; 2) memoranda; 3) inter-agency communications; 4) sound recordings; 5) tape recordings; 6) video or film recordings; 7) photographs; 8) notes; 9) notebooks; 10) indices; 11) jottings; 12) message slips; 13) letters or correspondence; 14) telexes; 15) telegrams; 16) facsimile transmissions; 17) statements; 18) policies; 19) manuals or binders; 20) books; 21) handbooks; 22) business records; 23) personnel records; 24) ledgers; 25) notices; 26) warnings; 27) affidavits; 28) declarations under penalty of perjury; 29) unsworn statements; 30) reports; 31) diaries; or 32) calendars, regardless of whether they are handwritten, printed, typed, mechanically or electronically recorded or reproduced on any medium capable of conveying an image, such as paper, CDs, DVDs, or diskettes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Quinn",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed.

Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1.

Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Code \u00a7 7920.000 et seq.) received by the City on 06/08/2025. \r\nResponse: The City has reviewed its files and located records responsive to your request. The City anticipates producing responsive records by 7/22/2025.\u00a0 As an initial response to your request, please view the following link which contains responsive information.\u00a0\u00a0https://transparency.flocksafety.com/palo-alto-ca-pd \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact me by responding to this message. Your request mentioned: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1.

Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2.

Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpalo-alto-police-department-404%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-palo-alto-police-department-187608%252F%253Femail%253Ddacia.tavares%252540cityofpaloalto.org&url_auth_token=AAAdGkZVM5s1T3Gc4G57-xbCdMY%3A1uOTGf%3AMHiAG5Kflu9sRJq6DRHFsAwcXdB5vDGzSINlfbiW5ck\u201d \r\nThe Palo Alto Police Department has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. An installment of records responsive to your request has been uploaded to Box. The records consist of a 702-page document (RM-00043 thru RM-00744) and 0 (MB) of native data. You may inspect and/or download these records via this link: https://atg-wa.box.com/s/9fx3rleuohaviqf0sfzhx7j0akip6af4 . Please do so within 30 days. Records provided via Box are free of charge. You do not need a Box account to access the records. If a password is required to access the records, one will be provided to you in a separate email. Also uploaded with these responsive documents is a key to the codes indicated as black boxes with a code, e.g., [1a], centered. The key identifies the statutory basis for the exemption as well as a brief explanation for why the exemption applies. As you review the responsive documents, you will be able to refer to the key to identify the exemption and its application. We have made every attempt to apply consistent redactions on documents that contain the same information. In the event you locate documents that contain redactions that are not applied consistently, please let me know. If you prefer to receive these records on CD, USB thumb drive, or paper, there is a charge. Please see the AGO Public Records Fee Schedule for cost information. If you prefer one of these formats, please submit a check or money order to my attention within 30 days, in the amount specified on the Fee Schedule, payable to the Office of the Attorney General, and send it to the address below. Once payment is received, the records will be mailed. Please be advised that if you do not either download these records, access them for inspection, or submit payment for an alternate format on or before September 12, 2025, the request is considered to have been fulfilled and is closed on that date for failure to claim or review records. This means that the Attorney General\u2019s Office will not further address the request, and that is the date from which the Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review starts to run. Please contact me within 30 days via email or at Office of the Attorney General, Public Records & Constituent Services, P.O. Box 40100, Olympia, WA 98504-0100, if you have any questions. Thank you.

ISP acknowledges receipt of your FOIA request received on July 29, 2025.\r\n\r\nISP is unable to comply with the portion of your request seeking the number of individuals who are on the Sex Offender Registry (SOR) and probation or parole. A list of individuals on the Illinois SOR can be located at https://isp.illinois.gov/Sor/Disclaimer. A manual search of each individual on the SOR would be required to determine how many are on parole. Not only would this be unduly burdensome, but the information would have to be searched within the LEADS database which is exempt pursuant to Section 7(1)(a) of FOIA and 20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d). Further, ISP does not house records of individuals on probation.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to review by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) in the Office of the Attorney General (5 ILCS 140/9.5(a)). You may reach the PAC at:\r\n\r\n500 S. 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62701\r\n(877) 299-3642\r\npublic.access@ilag.gov\r\n\r\nYou also have the right to judicial review under 5 ILCS 140/11.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler\r\nIllinois State Police\r\nFreedom of Information Officer\r\n801 South 7th Street, Suite 1000-S\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62703\r\nISP.FOIA.Officer@Illinois.gov",

This request will need to be handled through the following process.\r\n\r\nPursuant to HRS \u00a792F, and the Office of information Practices Administrative Rules, \u00a72-71-19, when a person requests access to a government record under Part II of Chapter 92F, HRS, the agency may charge the requester:\r\n\r\n(a) (1) Fees for searching, reviewing, and segregating the record; provided that these fees shall be assessed in accordance with this chapter; and\r\n(b) An agency may require a requester to prepay the following before an agency begins the search for and review of records in order to respond to a request for access:\r\n\r\n(1) Fifty percent of the total estimated fees for searching, for reviewing, and segregating records when the estimated fees exceed $30;\r\n(2) One hundred percent of the estimated fees from previous requests, including abandoned requests, in accordance with subsection (d).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in any request for information to DCR, the following charges apply for responsive documents: 1) @2.50 for each 15-minute period of search time; 2) $5.00 for each 15-minute period of review time and segregation; and 3) $0.50 per page for documents copied/digitized. The information that you seek is not readily available and will require a manual search, review, and segregation time. The estimated cost cannot be calculated at this time as I need a response from the section where we would obtain this information from. I will keep you updated as soon as I can, you will be notified of the final balance with payment due prior to releasing the information should there be any.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCheyenne Evans\r\nDepartment of Corrections & Rehabilitation\r\nLitigation Coordination Office\r\nActing Departmental Program Officer / PREA Coordinator\r\nCertified DOJ PREA Auditor\r\n1177 Alakea St.\r\nHonolulu, HI 96813\r\n\r\nThis email (including attachments) is covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2510-2521 and is confidential.

Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage.

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request was sent to JMD by the US Marshals Service as a misdirected request. The identifying tracking number was 2025-USMS-001026.  For your information, the Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).

The renewal application date for the permit was September 30, 2020. The current NPDES permit is not accessible through the NPDES database for Puerto Rico administered by EPA Region 2.Meanwhile, in the EPA database for NPDES permits for Puerto Rico, there are multiple NPDES permits that have seemingly gone past their expiration date without being renewed. The database can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/puerto-rico-npdes-permitsTherefore, I request the following records:1) Every current NPDES permit for Puerto Rico. To aid in your search, a list of facilities can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/puerto-rico-npdes-permits2) Any document certifying which NPDES permits for Puerto Rico have been \"administratively extended.\"Keywords: \"administratively extended,\" \"Puerto Rico,\" and \"NPDES\"This request is for all records produced between January 1, 2015 and the date this request is processed.

A \u201ca spreadsheet containing all the academic dishonesty reports\u201d is not something maintained as a standing document but instead would be a function of a download of information from our conduct database.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that which college would not be an ordinal piece of data available as academic dishonest reports are tracked centrally and may only appear nominally depending on the field. If you are requesting narrative reports, please note this will impact our response timeline as they will require significant care for redaction purposes to protect student identities.\r\n\r\nYour request will likely be subject to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.36(1) and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  The FERPA statute and regulations (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99) prohibit educational institutions from releasing non-directory, personally identifiable student information from education records absent prior written authorization from the student.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(2)(A), 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.30.  \u201cPersonally identifiable information\u201d includes any \u201cinformation that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your response.\nBest,\r\n\r\nIan",

Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01599.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request. \r\n\r\nThe records you seek require a search in at least one other office within ATF.  Accordingly, your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request by ten additional days, as permitted by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. \r\n\r\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  Your request was assigned to the Complex track.  It was placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing. \r\n\r\nBecause this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of FOIA requests at this time, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nHirsh D.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 232 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 659 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 998 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have an initial installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent 56 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. No new or additional redactions have been made to this particular installment of records, and the responsive records appear just as they did when provided to the original requester. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email.

Accordingly, if we do not hear from you by February 7, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, you must click the link and either download the files or click on the files to open them, and you must notify us that you have accessed the files or that you are unable to access the records made available to you no later than February 7, 2022.

As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional 36 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (the original requester was the parent of the student whose education record it was). An Exemption Log for this record is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a fourth installment of records available for you. This installment represents one of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district\u2019s response to that request. While this installment contains only one request, it was a large request that took many months to fulfill. Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. The detailed redaction/exemption logs, as they were provided to the original requester, are included. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, these records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below. As requested, this is a public link and is not password protected.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request \u2013 MuckRock PRA Audit<https://epscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/09566_apps_everettsd_org/ElXAf7ErlKVImKD_IAMyMH4B_Ms8oDse0n_mjePZU2dECw?e=uOB7mN>\r\n\r\nThe system will not notify us when you access your records. Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by May 22, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, if receipt of the current installment is confirmed by the aforementioned deadline, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before May 27, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8563D.1954A0C0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

Please note that two of these requests were made by parents of students in the district, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names.

New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (request 20200930 1b LB).

For the following reasons, your request was deemed abandoned on August 28, 2022, and was closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn response to your request, you were notified of our district\u2019s practices, and your obligation as the requester to review or claim your records, on the following dates:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n1.       click the link above; and\r\n2.      download or click on the files; and\r\n3.      notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nInstallments of records were provided to you as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  January 7, 2022 \u2013 claimed by email on 2/22/2022\r\n  2.  February 11, 2022 \u2013 claimed by email on 2/22/2022\r\n  3.  March 18, 2022 \u2013 assumed as claimed by proof of USPS delivery\r\n  4.  April 22, 2022 \u2013 assumed as claimed by email on 6/27/2022\r\n  5.  May 27, 2022 \u2013 assumed as claimed by email on 6/27/2022\r\n  6.  July 28, 2022 \u2013 unclaimed, no response received by district\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 2022, the district provided a sixth installment of records via link to a shared folder.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, we seek the following clarifications of your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The appears to be a follow up to your most recent request which had a date range of January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Your renewed request reverted back to the initial date range ending November 4, 2021. Please clarify and confirm the date range of your request. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with the date range provided in your request today, for records between January 1, 2010, through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  In your former request for records, received by the district on October 9, 2023, you noted that \"Installments of Records previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Please clarify if this statement remains true, or if you would like us to produce installments previously provided to you again. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with your request as worded, and will reproduce any records responsive to this request that may have previously been provided. Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have concluded processing this request and have the responsive records available for you. These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. If you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA86BB.0CDDA6B0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

Included in this installment is the request dated December 13, 2022, which is provided out of chronological order as was communicated to you on February 26, 2025, as it was a large request requiring extensive redactions and exemptions from public disclosure. In addition, and back in reverse chronological order, this installment also includes four public records requests received by the district between August 1, 2022, and August 31, 2022, and the district\u2019s responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3). Additionally, an Exemption Log is also provided, which details the records withheld in their entirety as records exempt from public disclosure, and the explanation and statutory reason for their exemption.\r\n\r\nThe responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail to the address provided in your request:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405530109355133832421<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tLabels=4200211545779405530109355133832421> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.

These records include 149 public records requests received by the district between January 3, 2020, and March 20, 2022, and the district\u2019s responses to those requests. Please note that we acknowledge your request to receive records in reverse chronological order, however, there is one public records request dated March 21, 2022, that will be provided in the next installment of records, as it is a large request requiring extensive redaction of student and parent personal information and it is still being processed. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nThe responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail to the address provided in your request:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405530109355177048857<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tLabels=4200211545779405530109355177048857> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, correspondence, and documents on Leonid Leonidovich Vasiliev, aka L. L. Vasiliev (1891\u20131966). Dr. Vasiliev was a professor of physiology at the Institute of Brain Research at the University of Leningrad and served on the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has identified Dr. Vasiliev as a subject of interest in documents in its CREST system, available via its Electronic Reading Room. One such document titled \"Parapsychology in the USSR\" can be found in the CREST system under document number CIA-RDP96-00792R000500210002-8. A copy of that document can be found at the following link: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000500210002-8.pdf\r\n\r\nFor verification of Dr. Vasiliev's death, please see page 2 of document number CIA-RDP96-00792R000500210002-8 which states: \"After Vasiliev's death in 1966, the center of soviet parapsychological research partially shifted from Leningrad to Moscow, where IPPOLIT KOGAN, Director of the Section for Bioinformation on the totally soviet scientific and technical A.S. Popov Institute for Radiotechnology and Electrical Communication was located.\"\r\n\r\nAs further verification that the CIA has created records on Dr. Vasiliev, CIA-funded researchers and adjacent military institutions interacted with and/or monitored Dr. Vasiliev before and after his passing. \r\n\r\nDr. Stephen Abrams, spoke and corresponded with Dr. Vasiliev between at least 1962 and 1966. A report created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1965 states of Abrams: \r\n\r\n\"On January 4, 1965 ABRAMS contacted the U. S. Embassy, London, to report his tentative acceptance of a Soviet Government research grant covering two years work at the University of Leningrad and at this time he inquired as to what effect this acceptance would have on his American citizenship ... ABRAMS on this occasion revealed that he had been on close terms with a Czech scientist residing in Czechoslovakia and described as a 'staunch anti-Communist'. ABRAMS advised he met this scientist through a Soviet scientist, Professor (FNU) VASILIEV. ABRAMS also made one or more trips to the Soviet Bloc during which he had discussed with Professor VASILIEV the research grant he claimed to have, beginning the summer of 1965.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of Dr. Abrams's FBI file containing the above passage can be found at the following link: https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/fbifiles/historical/stephenabrams-fbi1.pdf\r\n\r\nPrior to the Soviet research grant referenced in the quoted passage, Dr. Abrams received funds through the CIA's Project MKULTRA, as part of subproject 136. This subproject, per a project proposal, ran from August 1961 through July 1962 and covered research into an \"Experimental Analysis of Extrasensory Perception.\" \r\n\r\nA copy of that project proposal can be found at the following link: https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017395/page/n11/mode/1up\r\n\r\nThe CIA has publicly acknowledged Dr. Abrams's role in agency-funded MKULTRA research. In 2003 it approved the release of an article titled \"Parapsychology in Intelligence: A Personal Review and Conclusions\" by Dr. Kenneth A. Kress, originally published in volume 21, issue 4 of \"Studies in Intelligence\" (winter 1977). Footnote 2 on page 8 of this article identifies a draft report written by S. I. Abrams and titled \"Extrasensory Perception\", publication date December 14, 1965. Dr. Abrams is referenced by name in the following portion of the footnoted paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"In 1961, the  reports induced one of the earliest U. S. government parapsychology investigations when the chief of CIA's Office of Technical Service (then the Technical Services Division) became interested in the claims of ESP. Technical project officers soon contacted Stephen I. Abrams, the Director of the Parapsychological Laboratory, Oxford University, England. Under the auspices of Project ULTRA, Abrams prepared a review article which claimed ESP was demonstrated but not understood or controllable. The report was read with interest but produced no further action for another decade.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of that article can be found in the CREST system under document number CIA-RDP80-00630A000100010001-8 and at the following link: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000200030040-0.pdf\r\n\r\nDr. Vasiliev was a noted expert in the area of extrasensory perception (ESP), hence the correspondence between Abrams and Vasiliev. Dr. Vasiliev published a book on the subject of ESP, \"Mysterious Phenomena of the Human Psyche,\" in 1959, and it was later translated into English and published by New York University Press in 1965. Separately, the United States Air Force funded another translation in 1967 under AF 33(657)-16408. A copy of that translation with corresponding paperwork can be found at the following link: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0661891.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the CIA created records responsive to Dr. Vasiliev, given his interactions with Dr. Abrams and potentially other American researchers in the field of parapsychological research. Therefore, I am requesting all CIA records, correspondence, and documents on Leonid Leonidovich Vasiliev, aka L. L. Vasiliev.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Any agency interactions with Soviet researchers would help to broaden academic and public understanding of parapsychological research during the Cold War. Given the CIA's involvement in Project Star Gate, later known as Project Grill Flame\u2014a joint effort with the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Department of the Army involving remote viewing and ESP research\u2014records on Dr. Vasiliev would clarify how such research started and under what circumstances. Additionally, any such records on Dr. Vasiliev might potentially disabuse the public of some of the wilder conspiracy theories involving Project MKULTRA and Project Star Gate that have arisen since information on both was made available for public consumption.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

SF-716 forms are filed annually and may also be identified as Agency Security Classification Costs Estimates.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. \r\n\r\nCase law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request are moot for the purposes of determining the fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",
