This request is about the FBI's Terrorists Screening Center data.\r\n1. Provide documents that show a list of the countries that the TSDB is distributed to, as of 2023.  Also provide the contact organization in the country.\r\n2.  Provide documents that show the graphical trend of numbers added to the TSDB since 2003.\r\n3.  Provide documents that show the monthly reports of \"encounters\" in the United States for the last 5 years. \u201cEncounters\u201d means that a listed TSDB name is encountered by police or sheriff's dept in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored. The term \u201cdocument\u201d includes both the principal document responsive to the request as well as any studies, exhibits, supporting documentation or supplement thereof.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 110,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence.\u201d Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 713-306-8287. I will appreciate your prompt processing of this request as mandated by the FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWinter Owen Calvert\r\nMember, Board of Directors\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O. Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX 77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWinter Calvert",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to the sexologist Li Shiu Tong (\u674e\u5146\u5802) born: January 9th 1907 - died: October 5th 1993). Li Shiu Tong was an LGBTQ activist in the early 20th century. Li Shiu Tong was a companion of a Jewish German sexologist named Magnus Hirschfeld who was forced into exile by the Nazis. \r\n\r\nLi Shiu Tong's colorful life and death in obscurity have been described in numerous articles online, such as this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-asian-canadian-gay-activist-whose-theories-on-sexuality-were-decades-ahead-of-their-time-180834\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s, Li Shiu Tong enrolled at Harvard University and reportedly began engaging in gay rights advocacy. From the 1940s to 1974 he repeatedly entered the United States and enrolled in various universities. From 1974 until his death in 1993 Li Shiu Tong was a resident of Vancouver, Canada. It would logical to assume that a Chinese academic advocating for gay rights from the 1940s to the 1970s caught the bureau's attention. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the sexologist Li Shiu Tong (\u674e\u5146\u5802) from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Li Shiu Tong held by the Boston and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Li Shiu Tong. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Li Shiu Tong.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Li Shiu Tong.\r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together in having this request resolved. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

I am an assistant editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Including any document or file inserted into Mr. St. John\u2019s student records in regards or related to the incident referenced in this document. \r\n\r\nI request a copy of all disciplinary action(s), documents, or files generated during the time period in which Marley Nesta St. John was a student at Santa Monica community College. \r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that Santa Monica Community College is responsible for its police department and any missing documents to this case \r\nIt is requested that Santa Monica Community college produce all police reports that were generated by and for Santa Monica College Police Department, the staff at Santa Monica College, the office of judicial affairs at Santa Monica College, the Dean of students,  including any documents or information that were circulated or otherwise made available to  employees , professors, or other faculty in regards to Marley Nesta St. John\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been previously stated that there are no audio or video records or recordings existing in regards to this incident. Why have these important records not been retained ?\r\n Captain Carter did without question make his own digital recording on a device he had at his disposal at that time.   Including Captain Carters recording is of great importance. These recordings are a accurate and exhaustive evidentiary accounting of the incident which resulted I the clear violation of Mr. St. John's civil right's guaranteed under the constitution. Mr. St. John was unlawfully threatened without course or reason that would necessitate threats of violence, intimidation and persecution of an individual who was not threat to anyone.  Mr. St. John was clearly injured and wearing a cast on his broken foot.  Mr. St. John did nothing illegal whatsoever and simply recording the unnecessary and unlawful actions of Mr. Hernandez, who was in charge of the admissions department on that day. It was Mr. St. John's right to record the prejudicial way he was being trearted. Choosing to do so, in order to keep an accurate and complete record of that in which was taking place and that in which he was being subjugated to by Mr Hernandez and the Santa Monica College Police officers who were present that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the officers arrived at the request of Mr. Hernandez at the admissions department officers of the College Police Department identified themselves as Mr St. John was seated Peaceably and quietly Keeping to himself.   Mr. Hernandez then stated that Mr. St. John had been disruptive and abusive.\r\n The Police department officers at the scene did nothing to attempt to resolve the situation or help Mr. St. John With any difficulties he may  have been having. Nor did they attempt too ascertain the validity of the accusations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The SMC PD responding officers did in fact, and without question made demands and ordered Mr. St. John to produce  documents to prove his United States citizenship by surrendering  his passport for inspection, which is governed by United Nations charter and is only applicable to be demanded and or seized At international borders or inspection areas that have been previously established well marked, and those subject to such demands Had willingly done so by entering into these border areas.  These protocols were not followed and without any lawful reason or investigative necessity did in fact make threats of being arrested and trespassed from the school indefinitely and spending time in Santa Monica jail if he did not surrender his, protected documents and sensitive personal records contained in his passport. He attempted to explain to officers involved that what they were doing, was in fact, illegal and unconstitutional, and they had absolutely no right whatsoever or reason or investigative purpose to demand under the color of law his documents and passport from Mr. St. John.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. St. John refused, the officers physically assaulted Mr. St. John by violently and forcefully pushing his face to include the upper half of his torso and his shoulders, arms and hands forward onto the table in which she sat thereby detaining and arresting Mr. St. John at that moment, they then forcefully removed St. John\u2019s documents, unlawfully,  violating his civil rights assaulting him committing theft of a government document that they were not entitled to receive from Mr. St. John with the implied threat of more violence. Should he in any way shape or form verbally resist any further or physically attempt to maintain possession of his personal documents . After the violent and illegal theft of property , Assault and battery, Invasion of privacy intimidation as well violations of his civil rights officers and Mr. Hernandez did in fact take photocopies of Mr. St. Johns passport inspecting every page and the v visas contained therein.\r\n \r\nWhile remaining seated Mr. St. John explained to the officers that they had no right to do what they did , having done so at the direction of Mr. Hernandez did not justify their actions.

Including any document or file inserted into Mr. St. John\u2019s student records in regards or related to the incident referenced in this document. \r\n\r\nI request a copy of all disciplinary action(s), documents, or files generated during the time period in which Marley Nesta St. John was a student at Santa Monica community College. \r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that Santa Monica Community College is responsible for its police department and any missing documents to this case \r\nIt is requested that Santa Monica Community college produce all police reports that were generated by and for Santa Monica College Police Department, the staff at Santa Monica College, the office of judicial affairs at Santa Monica College, the Dean of students,  including any documents or information that were circulated or otherwise made available to  employees , professors, or other faculty in regards to Marley Nesta St. John\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been previously stated that there are no audio or video records or recordings existing in regards to this incident. Why have these important records not been retained ?\r\n Captain Carter did without question make his own digital recording on a device he had at his disposal at that time.   Including Captain Carters recording is of great importance. These recordings are a accurate and exhaustive evidentiary accounting of the incident which resulted I the clear violation of Mr. St. John's civil right's guaranteed under the constitution. Mr. St. John was unlawfully threatened without course or reason that would necessitate threats of violence, intimidation and persecution of an individual who was not threat to anyone.  Mr. St. John was clearly injured and wearing a cast on his broken foot.  Mr. St. John did nothing illegal whatsoever and simply recording the unnecessary and unlawful actions of Mr. Hernandez, who was in charge of the admissions department on that day. It was Mr. St. John's right to record the prejudicial way he was being trearted. Choosing to do so, in order to keep an accurate and complete record of that in which was taking place and that in which he was being subjugated to by Mr Hernandez and the Santa Monica College Police officers who were present that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the officers arrived at the request of Mr. Hernandez at the admissions department officers of the College Police Department identified themselves as Mr St. John was seated Peaceably and quietly Keeping to himself.   Mr. Hernandez then stated that Mr. St. John had been disruptive and abusive.\r\n The Police department officers at the scene did nothing to attempt to resolve the situation or help Mr. St. John With any difficulties he may  have been having. Nor did they attempt too ascertain the validity of the accusations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The SMC PD responding officers did in fact, and without question made demands and ordered Mr. St. John to produce  documents to prove his United States citizenship by surrendering  his passport for inspection, which is governed by United Nations charter and is only applicable to be demanded and or seized At international borders or inspection areas that have been previously established well marked, and those subject to such demands Had willingly done so by entering into these border areas.  These protocols were not followed and without any lawful reason or investigative necessity did in fact make threats of being arrested and trespassed from the school indefinitely and spending time in Santa Monica jail if he did not surrender his, protected documents and sensitive personal records contained in his passport. He attempted to explain to officers involved that what they were doing, was in fact, illegal and unconstitutional, and they had absolutely no right whatsoever or reason or investigative purpose to demand under the color of law his documents and passport from Mr. St. John.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. St. John refused, the officers physically assaulted Mr. St. John by violently and forcefully pushing his face to include the upper half of his torso and his shoulders, arms and hands forward onto the table in which she sat thereby detaining and arresting Mr. St. John at that moment, they then forcefully removed St. John\u2019s documents, unlawfully,  violating his civil rights assaulting him committing theft of a government document that they were not entitled to receive from Mr. St. John with the implied threat of more violence. Should he in any way shape or form verbally resist any further or physically attempt to maintain possession of his personal documents . After the violent and illegal theft of property , Assault and battery, Invasion of privacy intimidation as well violations of his civil rights officers and Mr. Hernandez did in fact take photocopies of Mr. St. Johns passport inspecting every page and the v visas contained therein.\r\n \r\nWhile remaining seated Mr. St. John explained to the officers that they had no right to do what they did , having done so at the direction of Mr. Hernandez did not justify their actions.  He has absolutely no power to request them to do anything like that.  Mr. St. John.  Mr. St. John was obviously injured, and in a cast of his leg to be very obvious that Mr. St. John was in no condition act in a violent manner nor display any threats or postures of violence towards anyone whatsoever he was seated at the time with his hands in plain sight.\r\n\r\nFor having such an incident take place it is not creditable that there were no video preserved from the security cameras or any reports made other than the one single report that was provided.
