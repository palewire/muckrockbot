        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request concerns Executive Order 14185 (\"Restoring America\u2019s Fighting Force\"), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/03/2025-02181/restoring-americas-fighting-force. I request a copy of the report required by Section 5 of the Executive Order, which provides: \"Department of Defense Internal Review.  The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an internal review that documents actions taken in pursuit of DEI initiatives, including all instances of race and sex discrimination and activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system.  The report shall be delivered to the Secretary of Defense within 90 days of the date of this order.\"\r\n\r\nThat report was due on or before April 27, 2025.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nThe Department has previously granted FIRE expedited processing. See, e.g., FOIA No. 25-F-2201.\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely an Executive Order requiring a report to the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the public's feedback may impact the final report required of the  Task Force's final report required of the Secretary of Defense to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy on or before July 26, 2025. (See Sec. 7(b) of the Executive Order.)  If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-intelligence-arm-dia-pausing-dei-mlk-holocaust-remembrance-and-other-observations/\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-radical-gender-ideology-dei-initiatives-military\r\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jan/29/pete-hegseth-creates-new-pentagon-task-force-ban-r/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3302523/trump-executive-orders-military-excellence/\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5277155/trump-military-transgender-dei-iron-dome-orders\r\nhttps://freebeacon.com/latest-news/die-dei-trump-signs-executive-order-banning-woke-program-in-military/\r\nhttps://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/01/hegseth-stands-anti-dei-task-force/402623/\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-01-30/hegseth-dei-defense-department-promotions-academies-16654199.html\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dod-creates-task-force-abolish-dei-offices-promote-systemic-racism\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5129386-west-point-cadet-clubs-ordered-disband/\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/branches/air_force/2025-03-20/air-force-base-dei-compliance-visits-17205950.html\r\nhttps://www.expressnews.com/news/article/dei-hegseth-trump-military-dei-air-force-20230989.php\r\nhttps://san.com/cc/naval-academy-removes-close-to-400-books-linked-to-dei-following-dod-order/\r\nhttps://www.fedweek.com/armed-forces-news/dod-task-force-visiting-installations-to-observe-dei-rollback/\r\nhttps://www.iheart.com/content/2025-02-06-west-point-shuts-down-campus-clubs-related-to-race-gender-amid-dei-attacks/\r\nhttps://www.campusreform.org/article/hegseth-orders-end-affirmative-action-admissions-service-academies/27419\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114409-pence-hegseth-military-promotions-race-sex/\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nFurther, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important public interest. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIf a portion of the responsive records become available before the entire request is complete, I respectfully request that the DOJ provide records on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

All requests for public records will be governed by the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 ILCS 140/1, and you may be receiving a redacted version of the requested records. IMPORTANT INFORMATION - if you requested footage of an encounter captured on an OFFICER WORN BODY CAMERA, the following applies. \r\nThe Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act (50 ILCS 706/10-20) provides that recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, unless certain exceptions dictate otherwise. (706/10-20(b)). \r\nIf a 706/10-20(b) exception exists, a request for body worn camera footage is processed in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1 et seq). \r\nFootage that is flagged, due to the filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.  Generally, if the footage is not flagged, footage is only subject to release under FOIA to the extent that the subject of the footage or that subject\u2019s attorney is the recipient. \r\nIf the requested footage falls into one of the exceptions above and is subject to FOIA as permitted by the Body Worn Camera Act, you must demonstrate that you are an authorized recipient. If you are making a request as the subject of a record, please provide photo identification. \r\nIf you are making a request on behalf of the subject of a public record, provide identification of the subject and a signed authorization sufficient to show that you are entitled to receive the same information as the subject. \r\n PHOTO IDENTIFICATI ON\u00a0is likely REQUIRED in order to identify you as the subject of the encounter with law enforcement who is seen on the body camera footage. \r\n \r\nUpon receipt of all required materials (photo ID, authorization, or fee, for example), your request will be processed in five (5) business days.\u00a0 If you would not otherwise be entitled to the requested record and have not provided the necessary materials in order to process the request, it will be denied following five (5) business days. \r\nPlease login to \"My Request Center\" to update your account information, track the status of your request and receive requested records when they become available. \r\n This is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account.
