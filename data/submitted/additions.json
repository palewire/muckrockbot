Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Acting Director, the prior head of ICE\u2019s Custody Management Division, and the agency\u2019s Acting Director during both the Trump and Biden Administrations, Tae Johnson is the single official with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by him about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving Johnon\u2019s emails for historians and experts to understand his response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
