Raw data collected through the Insurance Regulation Filing System (IRFS) as uploaded and submitted by insurance companies between 2000 and the date this request is submitted. \r\n\r\n2. The Catastrophe Claims Data for all hurricanes listed on the page (https://floir.com/tools-and-data/catastrophe-reporting) and source data files for the summary tables and maps in CSV or machine-readable format and at the county and zip code levels. \r\n\r\nThe summary tables and maps are already public, so I believe the underlying data exists. \r\n\r\nSee, for example, Hurricane Michael: https://www.floir.com/Office/HurricaneSeason/HurricaneMichaelClaimsData.aspx\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlice Tianbo Zhang",
