This should include all official communications, memos, directives, and policy documents he authored or was involved in.\r\n\r\nMeetings and Correspondences: All schedules, meeting notes, and correspondence involving Mr. Cohen-Watnick related to his duties in these roles.

I will also expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.\r\n\r\nAs I am making this request in the public interest, for non-commercial use, I request that you expedite the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
