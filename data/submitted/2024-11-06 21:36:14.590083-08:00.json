Further, \"A CIA official said the agency takes \u201cany claim of coercion, or perceived coercion, extremely seriously and fully cooperated with NIH\u2019s review of this matter, and have offered access to any information requested.\u201d Link to the CNN Article: https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/health/nih-havana-syndrome-study/index.html\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeonid Ber",

The disclosure of information that I am seeking is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of operations and activities of the government and I have no commercial interest in the requested material. As the EPA develops new environmental regulations and emission standards, it is critical that there be transparency around EPA meetings and communications, especially as these meetings and communications may include non-governmental interested parties.\r\n\r\nThe request concerns the operations or activities of the government. The topic of the request concerns calendars that point to the activities of the government, including activities related to creating policy and passing regulations that impact the health and safety of the public. Furthermore, the requested materials will shed light on the activities of the EPA during a time when a relatively new administration is taking on ambitious environmental regulations.\r\n\r\nDisclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities. The information requested includes calendars of EPA officials during a period in which the EPA is working to develop and set new environmental regulations and emissions standards. Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the EPA\u2019s operations because the information requested will shed light on who EPA officials are meeting with, including government and non-government officials, and in turn, help the public understand what topics and stakeholders the EPA is considering during this time. With this information, the public will be better able to provide comment and otherwise participate in the regulatory process.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of requested information will likely result in public understanding. The information will help the public better understand the EPA's activities and operations as it develops new environmental rules and regulations. Documented is seeking this information because it is of interest to a large portion of the public, including the many concerned citizens that regularly acquire this type of information through our extensive range of publications. These publications include websites, blogs, newsletters, reports, press statements, social media networks such as Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Documented\u2019s work reaches a broad audience by being featured in television, radio, print and online news articles and interviews, including Bloomberg, the Guardian, the Huffington Post among others.\r\n\r\nDocumented plans to compile the information from this request into a distinct, original work that will be released to the public through the manner described above. Moreover, Documented has the expertise and experience to disseminate the information received and ensure that disclosure of records will contribute to public understanding of operations at EPA.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of requested information will contribute significantly to public understanding. Information contained in material disclosed as a result of this request will contribute significantly to public understanding. Disclosure of information requested will provide new information to the public regarding agency operations during a time when a new administration has set ambitious climate goals and policy. This request is being sent during a time when there is immense urgency to address climate change and therefore, it is important that the public have a clear understanding of the EPA\u2019 activities and operations.\r\n\r\nAs public momentum around addressing the climate crisis continues to grow, it is critical that the public have access to information that will allow them to better understand the main government agency tasked with setting environmental regulatory policy. Greater transparency around who EPA officials are speaking and meeting with during this time will enable the public to understand whose interests are being considered and whose voices the EPA is listening to. For this reason, disclosure of the requested information will have significant impact on public understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requester has no commercial interest in the disclosure and therefore public interest in disclosure is greater than the commercial interest in the request. Documented does not have a commercial interest in the request. Documented seeks to inform the public about government activities and to serve the public interest by sharing materials disclosed through this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nColette Rosenberg",

For example, you may find his New York Post obituary at the following link: https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/business/billionaire-home-depot-co-founder-bernie-marcus-dead-at-95/\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

I am an assistant editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

These accommodations are essential to allow my full and equitable participation in every aspect of this request, as supported by ADA and Section 504 standards.\r\n\r\n1. Exclusive Email Communication Requirement\r\nDirective: All responses, updates, and communications must be sent directly via email to AabiWR@live.com. Do not use physical mail, phone calls, portal-based communications, external links, or any platform outside of direct email.\r\nPurpose: This ensures uninterrupted, immediate access to all correspondence and records without barriers, facilitating a fully accessible review process.\r\n\r\n2. Full Text in Email Body with Attachment\r\nDirective: Provide the full text of each response within the body of the email, alongside any attached documents available for download.\r\nPurpose: Including the full text in the email body allows for seamless, direct access to information, ensuring that all content is accessible without the need for additional downloads or platform navigation.\r\n\r\n3. Accessible Document Formatting\r\nDirective: Attach all records as individually labeled PDFs, organized by category and date. Each document should be clearly indexed for ease of reference.\r\nPurpose: This organization and accessible format support ADA accommodations, allowing for clear, barrier-free document review and navigation.\r\n\r\n4. Complete and Transparent Documentation\r\nDirective: Provide all requested records in full, without redactions unless legally mandated. If redactions are necessary, cite the specific legal exemption or statute applied and include a summary where possible to maintain context.\r\nPurpose: This ensures full transparency and access to all relevant information, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of each record without unnecessary limitations.\r\n\r\n5. Detailed Justifications for Redactions or Denials\r\nDirective: For any redactions or denials, provide a clear, detailed explanation for each item, including the specific legal statute or exemption used.\r\nPurpose: This accommodation ensures transparency and accountability in the review process, allowing for clarity on any withheld information.\r\n\r\n6. Guidance for Complex Records\r\nDirective: For records containing complex financial, legal, or medical terminology, provide summaries or simplified explanations to facilitate understanding.\r\nPurpose: This accommodation supports accurate interpretation of information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge, to ensure full comprehension.\r\n\r\n7. Identification of Responsible FOIA Officer(s) and Decision-Makers\r\nDirective: Provide the full names, titles, direct email addresses, and phone numbers of each FOIA officer, decision-maker, or supervisory personnel responsible for this request.\r\nPurpose: Clear identification of all involved personnel supports accountability and enables direct communication if clarification or follow-up is required.\r\n\r\n8. Confirmation of Accommodation Compliance\r\nDirective: Confirm receipt of this request and explicitly acknowledge that each accommodation will be fully applied in all responses and communications.\r\nPurpose: This confirmation ensures that my accessibility needs are fully understood and respected by all handling this request, providing assurance of compliance.\r\n\r\n9. Expedited Processing \r\nDirective: Due to the urgency of the public interest in this matter, I request expedited processing of this FOIA request as mandated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(a).\r\nPurpose: Expedited processing supports timely access to records essential for immediate public and legal oversight, especially in matters affecting vulnerable populations or public welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Standards for Compliance\r\nThis request and appeal are based on the following legal mandates:\r\n\r\nConnecticut FOIA (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242) \u2013 Mandates full, prompt, and unambiguous access to public records.\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) \u2013 Requires equitable access to all records and processes for individuals with disabilities.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) \u2013 Guarantees equal access and ADA accommodations, particularly in public agency processes affecting disabled individuals.\r\nImmediate Response Required: Confirm receipt of this appeal, provide a timeline for compliance with the requested accommodations, and commit to a specific delivery date for comprehensive disclosure of all requested records. Partial compliance, unjustified redactions, or further obstruction will prompt escalated legal and federal oversight to enforce adherence to FOIA, ADA, and federal whistleblower protections.\r\n\r\nBy meeting these statutory requirements, CHRO and DSS can fulfill their legal and ethical obligations for transparency, accountability, and procedural integrity.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com",

Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many of the requested records are likely exempt from disclosure pursuant to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records containing information the University acquired in confidence and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 1040, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that pertain to pending litigation to which the University is a party (Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.200);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Correspondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor\u2019s office (Govt. Code 7928.000\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Preliminary drafts or notes that are not retained by the University in the ordinary course of business are protected from disclosure because the public interest in withholding those records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Govt. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7927.500 and 7922.000);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUCOP CPRA Office\n",
