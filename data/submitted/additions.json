Please also include emails for which Jadine Chou is copied (cc or bcc) for this time span.\r\n\r\nI am not requesting the emails themselves; this is a request for email metadata, including senders, recipients, date and time, subject line, and any attachments.\r\n\r\nThis is a non-commercial request. If there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance. Because this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit Lucy Parsons Labs, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ICLS 140/6(c).\r\n\r\nI prefer for the responsive records to be sent electronically. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if clarification is needed.\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nLucy Parsons Labs",
