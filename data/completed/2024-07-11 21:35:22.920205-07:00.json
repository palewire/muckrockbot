From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Unfortunately, the \"playtime\r\nreport\" is just the data that's available within the i-ready system;\r\nthere's no option  within the software to export that data, nor do we have\r\naggregate data by school or district, just a YTD total of playtime minutes\r\nfor each class at each school. Putting that data into a shareable format\r\nwould involve manually tabulating data for each school. As per our\r\noriginal estimates this would be many many hours of staff time.\r\n\r\nNow that I better understand the software, I also took another look at the\r\nsample you'd provided from Warwick(?) schools; I see that they have some\r\ndata access included in their contract. I will find out if our contract\r\nprovides for the same, and we will reach out again to the vendor to see if\r\nthey have the ability to provide similar data for us. I'll let you know if\r\nthat pans out, and then you can decide how to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n*Thank you kindly,*\r\n\r\nRyan Vandehey\r\n\r\nPublic Records Officer & Media Relations Representative\r\n\r\nPortland Public Schools\r\nCommunications Department | Office of the Superintendent\r\n\r\nCell: 971-678-6103\r\n\r\nPronouns: he/him/his",

Guarino (DoB: 9/14/1967), the Sodexo operations manager assigned to MCC until February 2022.\r\n\r\n## Specific records\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following specific records:\r\n1.) Any communications with Sodexo regarding the lawsuit or Roger Guarino's status at MCC or the MCC Association.\r\n2.) Any communications between MCC, the MCC Association, or  Roger Guarino regarding the lawsuit or any steps taken by MCC or the MCC Association in response to the lawsuit.\r\n3.) Any communications with any other educational institution regarding Roger Guarino, including any communications with the University of Arkansas - Little Rock, where Sodexo reassigned Roger Guarino to another position that involved interacting with children despite being aware of the child molestation lawsuit.\r\n\r\n## Applicability of FOIL to the  MCC Association, Inc \r\n\r\nI contend that records maintained MCC Association, Inc, a non-profit associated MCC, are within the scope of the New York Freedom of Information Law. Such records constitute \"material received by a corporation providing services for a State university and kept on behalf of the university\" (Encore Coll v. Auxiliary Serv NY Court of Appeals (1995) 87 N.Y.2d 410,414) and are thus \"a record subject to disclosure under FOIL\" (id.).\r\n\r\n## Fees\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees in excess of $200, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdward",

Once contacted, the company providing our open records management system indicated that we can run a report that displays basic information on the requests submitted, including: reference number, create date, request status, customer name, and basic description of public record desired. \nAccording to that company, there . To capture the communications information, the requests will need to be exported one at a time. is no way to run a report that shows all correspondence or communications related to the requests \nAdditionally, approximately 163 of these 1,750 requests were filled out manually, in-person at our front desk. These handwritten requests were scanned into the online system.

Your request mentioned: Please provide all FOIA requests sent to McLennan County and all entities under the McLennan County umbrella and all departments in the McLennan County System from January 1st 2024 to 06/17/2024. We do not need any responsive document just the original request and any communications related to that request, we do not need the actual responsive documents. \nFurther clarification is required to complete your request: Dustin Chapman forwarded an email stating you would accept the $73.36 charge for the manual request and a bulk pull of the rest, but I need to confirm in writing that you are waving your request for \"any communications\" that go with each request since those would have to be pulled individually if you are still wanting them. Please confirm in writing that you are waving that portion of your request and I can continue. Thank you. Respond to this email with the details requested above. Upon receipt of clarification, the McLennan County Sheriff's Office will further respond to your public records request as required by law. For questions or additional information, please reply to this email. Sincerely, Lisa Foster \nRecords \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Open Records Request Portal (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXf-2BjtJqt2dHoqDdFRIHkBPHGWMOA4-2BxvG16RM1bx2PEQ88xYavF7SDw7vGsjj2Aw456tooE9-2BjQu-2FIWhdjT61bAgFbv7gOEFpVTxeQ-2FKoejxYh6O_qyIcOwuygsI0WqwjM028jb5Y9LgrC-2Fel3HsXl5voGGSmUK36IQWS0Thguh8aRfv-2FhJ0PBbFQZuz9382wAHtFd9tWCZCUD4lCqLFZUtZ2Kvl-2BvdQYQbIRg-2BJV4a13r8L7d0YTtfka2hvfwPkYdo4MC97uysXC0vVuYpiVSH0zU9ZIcYYYqmyvoc0iTQuYx-2Bvux0Mpp4zw9appjh9aI4psb4qQuaECmZDcMX7uKsFbHaUyvByNmGpmt266V3YSNYBmzvXuvAaN45gACp-2FCgk7qC1nekJ7zYsTUREgk5Com4kVKy57-2FbS6yEvCv-2FUBBslVjQkVVZy45kW3N8cxnKqNl-2Fi4wMODqavn-2B7MdafxfVsiFU05-2Bykp2pO8o4XvtXRvK1co5sSd2S5YaOCUm-2BMuVutQ-3D-3D)\n",

It partially fulfills item #3 on the list, however, items #1, #2, and #4 remain unanswered/denied.  If I cannot obtain these contracts, footage, or complaints through your organization please let me know, as per NRS 239.0107(1). If this is the case, I would also appreciate direction to the correct agency. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I believe the NPRA law requires agencies to provide reasoning for the denial of public records (NRS 239.0107(d)).\r\n\r\nI recognize fulfilling the totality of my original request would result in the search for a large number of documents, so if it helps, the purpose of my request is to understand the relationship between UNR and Starship through their contracts and agreements, as well as marketing plans. I also want to understand the relationship between UNR students and Starship through incident reports and video footage.  If you find that you do have the records that I am looking for, and need more time to gather them, please provide me with a date that they will be ready by. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help, and let me know if you need me to provide more clarification. \r\n\r\nMy best,\r\nBrooke Germain",

Some of the information requested is not available in a report.  However, I have attached as much as is possible at this time.  Additionally, please find our response to your Public Information Request. Identifying factors (Names) have been redacted in accordance with \u00a74-501 of the General Provisions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The list requested by you, albeit a public record, is also a \"personal record\" pursuant to Section 4-501 of the General Provisions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland because it names the employee. While the PIA makes it clear that the salary of a public employee is subject to disclosure, Section 4-401 of the General Provisions Article makes it unlawful for an employee of a governmental unit to willfully and knowingly allow inspection or use of a public record that names or, with reasonable certainty, otherwise identifies the individual by an identifying factor. Amongst other things, Section 4-501(c)(3)(iv) & (v) of the General Provisions Article states that the Custodian must disclose to persons of interest/employees: 1) whether the personal information is generally available for public inspection and 2) whether the personal information collected is made available, transferred or shared with any other entity other than the Custodian.   \r\n \r\nIt could also be argued that this is a part of the employee's personnel record. [But for the exemption of the salary of a public employee], Section 4-311 prohibits inspection of an employee's personnel record except by the employee, an elected or appointed official who supervises the employee's work or an employee organization described in Title 6 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, none of which are applicable in this case.\r\n \r\nIt is our practice to disclose job titles and salaries only per the above listed provisions of the Annotated Code of Maryland.",

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with the RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file a RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Cmmw. 2012). As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a Right-to-Know\u00a0Request pursuant to the RTKL and will process it as an informal request.  You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request. Please note that if you resubmit your request as a written request pursuant to the RTKL, the City will deem your informal request to have been withdrawn.\u00a0  The City\u2019s Open Records Policy can be found here:\u00a0  https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/   The statewide form appears at the end of the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. If you require a hard copy of the form and/or policy, please let me know and one will be provided.  The City reserves the right to assert any and all grounds of denial in its final response to your request.
