I seek access to records in your possession regarding the activities of the Guerini crime family, specifically relating to:\r\n\r\n1. Their involvement in dock strikes and union activity during the post-World War II period.\r\n2. Their participation in political violence in post-war France.\r\n3. Their role in heroin trafficking, particularly connections between Europe and the United States during the mid-20th century.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\n\r\nTimeframe: 1945\u20131960.\r\nGeographic Focus: Primarily France and Europe, with connections to the United States.\r\nFocus Areas: Organized crime, labor union influence, political unrest, and narcotics trafficking.\r\n\r\nSpecific Records of Interest:\r\n\r\n-Investigations, surveillance, or intelligence reports related to the Guerini crime family or their associates.\r\n-Records detailing international collaboration or law enforcement efforts targeting organized crime and narcotics trafficking.\r\n-Reports on labor unrest or political violence where organized crime may have played a role.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request:\r\nThis request is made for historical research purposes to understand the influence of organized crime on labor movements, political events, and international narcotics trafficking. The information sought is of public and scholarly interest and pertains to understanding transnational organized crime during the post-war era.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nI am not requesting personal information or records that identify confidential informants, third parties, or victims. My request pertains solely to records documenting the activities of the Guerini family or broader patterns associated with their influence.\r\nIf any records contain sensitive material, I request that redacted versions be provided in accordance with FOIA requirements.  Please include any records that originated from predecessor agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, etc.).  If any portion of this request is denied, I request a detailed explanation of the exemption(s) applied and a Vaughn Index describing withheld records and justifications for non-disclosure.\r\n\r\nFile Categories to Search:\r\nPlease search any relevant investigative, intelligence, or archival files pertaining to:\r\n1. Narcotics trafficking (e.g., heroin smuggling routes from France to the U.S.).\r\n2. Labor movements and union activity (e.g., dock strikes influenced by organized crime).\r\n3. Political violence or unrest in post-war France tied to organized crime.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. Please feel free to contact me here if clarification or additional information is required to process this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please include any records that originated from predecessor agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, etc.).  If any portion of this request is denied, I request a detailed explanation of the exemption(s) applied and a Vaughn Index describing withheld records and justifications for non-disclosure.\r\n\r\nFile Categories to Search:\r\nPlease search any relevant investigative, intelligence, or archival files pertaining to:\r\n1. Narcotics trafficking (e.g., heroin smuggling routes from France to the U.S.).\r\n2. Labor movements and union activity (e.g., dock strikes influenced by organized crime).\r\n3. Political violence or unrest in post-war France tied to organized crime.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. Please feel free to contact me here if clarification or additional information is required to process this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

According to a document released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Ronin 3.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Ronin 3,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

According to documents released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production in 2022. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm. Incident number or other unique identifier for each arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nn.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1.

I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne.

Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm.
