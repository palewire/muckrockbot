These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased). Meanwhile the public interest in such the historical study of OCDETF cases has been established by reviews of the Management Information System by the National Archives.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "I am merging some of the language into this request from a request that I am withdrawing due to insufficient specificity, request 60889.\r\n\r\nMy limited understanding of the workings of NIAID records management is that it appears that I cannot query for communications from outside sources without specifying an NIAID \"custodian\". This is disappointing, but not something I can change. For reference, the following language is from withdrawn request 60889:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Emails to or from drtedros@who.int, or any other communications to or from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the WHO. Similarly for the following email addresses and individuals:\r\n\r\nvankerkhovem@who.int, Maria Van Kerkhove of\r\ngreint@who.int (Dr Thomas Grein)\r\nryanm@who.int (Mike Ryan)\r\nJeremy Farrar - chief scientist at the World Health Organization, may not be using who.int email address in official capacity\r\nsterng@who.int (Gabriellea Stern)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, broadly, any individuals and email addresses associated with the who.int top level domain.\"\r\n\r\n ---\r\n\r\nI would like to amend this current request (60900) with the following language to prebut certain redactions:\r\n\r\nIn the government's response to several other FOIA requests, hundreds and hundreds of pages of responsive records originating from the WHO were redacted under exemption (b)(5).\r\n\r\nFor example, an attachment in one such request titled \"WHO Confidential Situation Report, Saturday, 13 June 2020\", in an email from moffettd@who.int, sent on Saturday, June 13, 2020 4:24 AM.\r\n\r\nCountless other examples abound in the responsive records for other requests. GORAN call notes. Slide decks. Various reports and drafts of reports.\r\n\r\nIn Lucaj v. FBI, No. 16-1381 (6th Cir. 2017), The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled:\r\n\"Key to answering this question is the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe first condition of Exemption 5 is no less important than the second; the communication must be \u2018inter-agency or intra-agency.\u2019\u201d Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. Indeed, the first condition here is all-important. However broad the term agency can be, see Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, Bureaucracy at the Boundary, 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 841 (2014), FOIA offers, for our purposes, a more limited definition: \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 means each authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), cited in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) (elaborating that \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 as defined in section 551(1) of this title includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency\u201d). So, to be inter-agency memorandums or letters, the RFAs must have been sent from an authority of the Government of the United States to an authority of the Government of the United States. The OIA, undoubtedly an authority of the Government of the United States, sent the RFAs to the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed country, undoubtedly not authorities of the Government of the United States. The RFAs\u2019 recipients having failed to meet\r\nFOIA\u2019s definition of agency, we hold that the RFAs from the OIA to the Central Authority of Austria and the unnamed country are not inter-agency. And given that the RFAs are not intra-agency either, they may not be withheld under Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\n...and later in the ruling:\r\n\"But in the end, Congress chose to limit the exemption\u2019s reach to \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), not to \u201cmemorandums or letters among agencies, independent contractors, and entities that share a common interest with agencies.\u201d In view of our responsibility to \u201cnarrowly construe[]\u201d FOIA\u2019s exemptions, see Schell, 843 F.2d at 937 (quoting Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)), our response today echoes that of the Supreme Court and Congress: however important it may be for the OIA to have frank communications with the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government, however common the interest between the OIA and its international partners, the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government are not, so far as Congress has defined the term, agencies. Therefore, the RFAs from the OIA to these countries are not \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters\u201d within the scope of Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this, all responsive communications to and from agencies of *foreign* governments must be released under the law, they may not be redacted or withheld under (b)(5). According to the court opinion, this applies no matter if they're deliberative, predecisional, or redactable under any (b)(5) privilege. If the NIH FOIA officers cannot provide a superseding court decision, they will be in violation of law. I am willing at this point to retain legal counsel.\r\n\r\nThis should include all manner of foreign documents previously incorrectly redacted or withheld under (b)(5), including but absolutely not limited to GORAN call notes, slide decks, various reports and drafts of reports, emails that were sent to many other recipients in addition to being to or from the NIH, and anything similar.\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, several responsive records in the aforementioned FOIA request (and other, similar, requests) appear to have been withheld entirely under (b)(4). GORAN call notes are one such record.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act explains of exemption 4:\r\n\r\n\"The exemption also affords protection to those submitters who are required to furnish commercial or financial information to the government by safeguarding them from the competitive disadvantages that could result from disclosure.4 The exemption covers two distinct categories of information in federal agency records, (1) trade secrets, and (2) information that is (a) commercial or financial, and (b) obtained from a person, and (c) privileged or confidential\"\r\n\r\n(And)\r\n\r\n\"The D.C. Circuit's decision in Public Citizen represented a distinct departure from what until then had been almost universally accepted by the courts -- that a \"trade secret\" encompasses virtually any information that provides a competitive advantage. In Public Citizen, a \"trade secret\" was more narrowly defined as \"a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort.\"8 This definition also incorporates a requirement that there be a \"direct relationship\" between the trade secret and the productive process.9\"\r\n\r\nI find it highly questionable that the GOARN call notes - about an ongoing disease outbreak - contain entirely \"commercial or financial\" text. I also find it wildly unlikely that the GOARN calls were only ever about the implementation of specific manufacturing techniques.",
