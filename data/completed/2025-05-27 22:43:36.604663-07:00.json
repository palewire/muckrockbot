Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records revealing the deliberations of agency officials used to reach a decision. \r\n\u2022 Preliminary Drafts and Similar Materials \u2013 Government Code section 7927.500 \u2013 Any preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business are exempt from disclosure. \r\n\u2022 Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Official Information Privilege \u2013 Government Code section 7927.705, Evidence Code sections 1040 \u2013 Information acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his or her duty and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public prior to the time the claim of privilege is made. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Records Related to Law Enforcement or Security \u2013 Government Code section 7923.600 \u2013 Records of complaints to, or investigations conducted by, or records of intelligence information or security procedures of \u2026 any state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Public interest balancing test - Government Code section 7922.000 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. \r\nPlease log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records: City Records Request - N000380-042225  Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\nKindest regards, Laura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk",

Unfortunately, we do not currently have funding to cover the cost of the full record request.\r\n\r\nInstead, I\u2019d be very grateful if you could provide the name, title, work email, and phone number of  supervisory-level staff at the Iowa Department of Corrections who are responsible for overseeing or coordinating mental health services or programming within state correctional facilities.\r\n\r\nI understand this may fall outside of a formal records search and hope this more limited request is feasible without significant cost. Any partial guidance or contact information you\u2019re able to share would be sincerely appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",

That is completely understandable. I would appreciate it if you could share documents with me as they are identified and reviewed.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if possible, could you please retrieve these materials first? Being emails and documents sent to the Planning Department between January 15, 2024, and February 15, 2024. These would be addressed to leadership in the Planning Department\u2014Chief James Jemison, Director Aimee Chambers, and Director Abdul-Razak Zachariah\u2014from Margaret Turner of Greater Boston Legal Services. It\u2019s possible that members of the City of Boston Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Community Advisory Committee were included on some or all of this correspondence.\r\n\r\nThank you also for your recommendation regarding records that do not include staff from the BPDA or Planning Department. I appreciate your suggestion to follow up with the City\u2019s Public Records Office for those materials.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlice",

Meaning these are all the employees who work at the institution? Wanted to ask since there were only 48 positions.\r\n\r\nAnswer: The information provided was for Administrators. All other employees are in a CBA. \r\n\r\n- Is there anything to indicate the actual salary and their FTE? \r\n\r\nAnswer: That is the actual salary as FTE. \r\n\r\n2. Are these \"groups\" official pay grades for the employees?\r\n\r\nAnswer: There are ranges based on benchmarking for recruitment and retention. \r\n\r\n3. Are there job descriptions for these staff positions?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Only have job descriptions for Administrators. Clerical (ESPA), Security (ESPA) Maintenance and Operations (TSPA) is civil service: https://www.niagaracounty.gov/employment/job_specs_for_civil_service_positions.php. Rates are also in the CBA\u2019s that were already provided, and faculty is in the handbook which is attached as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything else needed.\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nKristin Leszkowicz",

Any and all agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), authorizations, or written permissions between the City of Clinton and Laurens County (or any of its departments) that authorize Clinton Sanitation to dispose of waste at the Laurens County Transfer Station (formerly the old Laurens landfill).\r\n\r\n2. Weigh tickets, intake logs, daily reports, manifests, billing statements, or invoices documenting any waste received from the City of Clinton or its sanitation department, including waste routed to Twin Chimney landfill.\r\n\r\n3. Internal emails, letters, or communications between Laurens County staff or officials and the City of Clinton (or its sanitation department) regarding trash disposal, dump site access, or waste transport arrangements.\r\n\r\n4. Any records or documentation maintained by Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department that reference the City of Clinton\u2019s use of county-operated waste facilities or routes used to deliver municipal waste.\r\n\r\nThis request follows a prior FOIA submission that was denied based on the claim that no responsive records exist. However, recent public statements from a sanitation worker have confirmed daily waste disposal operations by Clinton at the Laurens County Transfer Station, which is operated by the Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department. This indicates responsive documents do, in fact, exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdwin Chadwick",

You should receive it soon.\r\n\r\nThis request was submitted in good faith, and recent statements from a sanitation worker with direct knowledge contradict the County\u2019s prior response that no records exist. I\u2019m simply seeking clarity and transparency on a matter of public concern, and I would appreciate your continued cooperation in processing the request as written.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any further steps I need to complete.

The search parameters you provided yielded 6,872 e-mail messages and attachments. In order to comply with this request, the metadata for each of the over 6,872 e-mail messages would have to be downloaded and reviewed to determine if it is responsive to your request or is exempt from disclosure. To upload, read, and review the data and redact information not public under FOIA would take hours upon initial review of each email and would require review by multiple CPS FOIA Officers. It would also require research as student information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Illinois School Student Records Act. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS. This\u00a0is\u00a0NOT\u00a0an automatic\u00a0denial\u00a0of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3 (g), we are asking that you narrow your request to more manageable proportions by replying to this email. If you do not narrow your request within 5 business days, this request will be closed. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. \r\nThank you for your request.

RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . Under the rules of FOIA, identifiable student-level confidential information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, section 7.5(r) exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/2(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been excluded pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Lastly, records have been redacted pursuant to Section 7(1)(d)(iv) which allows a public to withhold records/information that would unavoidably reveal the identity of a complainant or witness. In case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor: Office of the Attorney General: 500 South 2 nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Rand V. Araskog.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma North-Best\r\n    \r\n    Attachments:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    https://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/EmmaBest/100337/Rand_V._Araskog_Former_Chief_of_ITT_Corp._Dies_at_89_-_The_New_York_Times.pdf\r\n    \r\n    https://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/EmmaBest/100337/Fee20category20and20search20parameters.pdf\r\n    Upload documents directly:\r\n    https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ffederal-bureau-of-investigation-10%252Frand-v-araskog-118596%252F%253Femail%253Dfoipaquestions%252540fbi.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj2DhBAMB3M81TmD2Oe8C8-1M%3A1mKtJq%3ASuXoNWH1MNdFBZTn-i2I4H6RWbg\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

Duplicates from each year do not need to be completed. At a minimum, photos for 2023 - 2024 should be included. \r\n\r\nPrecedent: Santa Ana Police Department and LAPD have released their photos. A reminder that nothing in California Penal Code 832.7 mentions photographs in personnel records are kept confidential. Not only that, but videos and pictures of officers are regularly shared on social media. \r\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-las-second-lawsuit-against-journalist-over-police-headshots/ \r\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-13/city-of-la-officers-city \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipation cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoey Scott \r\nThe City of Torrance has reviewed its files and have located some records responsive to your request. Other information pertaining to your request from other departments/divisions may not be available at this time. \r\nPlease find the records pertaining to the information requested attached along with this message. If you created an Account using the online Torrance Public Records Center, you may also log in and download your documents using the request number provided above. \r\nThank you for your interest in the City of Torrance. This is a PARTIAL RELEASE, and your request is still OPEN. \r\nSincerely, \r\nNicholas Casis \r\nManagement Aide",

All of her information should be disclosed and readily available from VMI.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I also request records of any [2] proposed and/or enacted changes to said policies made on or after Nov. 6, 2024 until date of search, if such documents exist.\"\r\n\r\nRequest #1: Our complete Policies and Procedures are available in the public domain and as such, we are not required to provide them (2 AAC 96.100 (b)). I draw your attention to the following policy numbers:\r\n\r\n  *   202.15: Standards of Conduct\r\n  *   804.01: Special Management Prisoners\r\n  *   806.02: Prisoner Hygiene, Grooming and Sanitation\r\n  *   806.04: Prisoner Uniform\r\n  *   807.02: Access to Health Care Services\r\n  *   807.05: Use of Pharmaceutical Products\r\n  *   807.09: Medical Experimentation\r\n  *   807.23: Treatment and Management of Gender Dysphoria\r\n  *   807.24: Treatment and Management of Female Prisoners\r\n  *   808.09: Prisoner Housing\r\n  *   808.10 Prisoner Marriages\r\n  *   811.04: Search Upon Admission\r\n  *   811.05: Prisoner Property\r\n  *   811.08: Prisoner Orientation\r\n  *   812.10 Prisoner Employment\r\nThe (2022) Alaska DOC Gender Dysphoria Clinical Care Guide is attached.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use the following resources, available online: National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Standards for Health Services in Prisons, NCCHC Standards for Health Services in Jails, and NCCHC Standards for Mental Health Services in Correctional Facilities.\r\n\r\nRequest #2: No such records exist.\r\n\r\nBy regulation, this response technically constitutes a partial denial of your records request (because certain records you request do not exist).  For that reason, I am required to provide you the following information. I have been delegated the authority to deny public records requests for the Department of Corrections; you may administratively appeal this denial to the agency head, by complying with the procedures of 2 AAC 96.340.  You may pursue immediate judicial review of this denial by seeking an injunction from the Superior court under AS 40.25.125.  Choosing not to pursue an injunction in Superior court will have no adverse effect on your rights in the administrative appeal.  An administrative appeal from the denial of a request for public records requires no appeal bond.  Copies of 2 AAC 96.335 - 2 AAC 96.350 are enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nBetsy\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DBC8A1.D796B670]",

A copy of the Request is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 10/20/2022, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Acknowledged receiving my FOIA Request on 10/18/2022 and reported the following Tracking Numbers for it: 23-00135-F, 23-00499-F, 23-00566-F, 23-00567-F, 23-00568-F, 23-00569-F, 23-00570-F.  Veterans Health Administration stated in that Acknowledgement that the Requested Records, if they exist, will be maintained by Veterans Health Administration; as well as other divisions of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including the VA Office of the Inspector General, all of which VHA is coordinating with to satisfy the Request.  A copy of VHA's 10/20/2022 Acknowledgement is attached to this Letter within \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 11/17/2022, I received an \"Agency Final Response\" to my FOIA Request from Government Information Specialist Barya Offer, on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  The sum of Offer's purported \"Agency Final Response\" is, \"please see the Agency Final Response regarding your request\"; with an attached PDF file named \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial.pdf\".  Said file is a letter from Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthhee G. Bellamy of the VA OIG Release Information Office - notifying me that VA OIG assigned Tracking Number 23-00006-FOIA to my Request, among other things.  A copy of VHA's 11/17/2022 \"Agency Final Response\" is included in the \"Appendix A\" attachment to this Letter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" letter from VA OIG on 11/17/2022 is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix B\"; and declares \"we were unable to locate any responsive records pertaining to your request\"; yet only as the Request pertains to Inspector General Michael J. Missal in VA OIG Records.  Unfortunately, VA OIG's Response to my Request is a false statement of fact; provable by one of many Records in my possession which would have to be included in any satisfactory Response to my Request, notwithstanding whether that Response is from VA OIG, VHA or otherwise applicable officse / divisions of US DVA.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned Record in my possession is an e-mail I sent to Inspector General Missal and others on 05/27/2022 regarding VCOEB, that a simple search for the text \"VCOEB\" will produce upon querying Inspector General Missal's e-mail correspondence between 05/01/2022 and Present.  Given that e-mail was not returned to sender and Inspector General Missal directly corresponded with me several times in the recent past from the same e-mail address; and because information about a Federal Advisory Committee that holds Public Meetings in Open Session on Public land for Public attendance (as Publicly Noticed in the Federal Register), is not qualified to be suppressed due limited National Security provisions under 5 U.S.C. Statutes governing FOIA - apparently the minimum effort to satisfactorily Respond to my Request is beyond some U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Officials' intent to perform...  Despite VA OIG's purported \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" Letter probably cost Federal Taxpayer's far more to produce than performing the simple searches to lawfully satisfy and Respond to my Request will; presuming Public Records required to satisfy my Request were not unlawfully tampered with. Even in that hypothetical scenario though, the Records are obtainable from one of many archives US DVA is Mandated to retain as National Security against the tampering or loss of such Records.  A copy of my aforementioned 05/27/2022 e-mail to Inspector General Missal and one of many e-mails Inspector General Missal sent me from the same address he received my 05/27/2020 e-mail at, are attached to this Letter as \"Appendix C\".\r\nNotwithstanding the validity or lack thereof in VA OIG's Response to a portion of my Request through VHA, the partial Response is not a legitimate, full Response to my Request; despite it being uncannily misrepresented as such by false statements of fact.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is at least procedurally failing to Respond to my Request on time in accordance with Federal Public Law.  I reassure you the Requested Records regarding a Federal Advisory Committee with a Public Law Mandate and Charter to improve outcomes for Veterans via Public Meetings held in Open Session here in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran Homelessness - are delays of Public Records offering a direct positive impact on disabled homeless Veterans' probability of survival and General Welfare of U.S. Taxpayers  Contrarily, the ongoing and baseless delays Responding to my Request are negatively impacting disabled homeless Veterans and Federal Taxpayers, until and unless the Request is fully and legitimately Responded to.\r\n\r\nGiven my maintained Good Faith in the majority of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Staff's Public Integrity and capacity to ethically perform their duties in accordance with the Department's true Mission - I expect nothing less than the People of the United States of America do in this matter; a swift, comprehensive, accurate and satisfactory Response to my Request in accordance with Our Rights, Public Laws and increasing expenditures to expect no less of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' performance in respect thereof.\r\n\r\nI declare under under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
