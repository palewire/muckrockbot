Specifically, I am interested in complaints related to First Amendment auditing.\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment auditing refers to the practice of individuals recording and photographing government officials or buildings in public spaces, as a means of asserting their First Amendment rights to free speech and the press. This practice has become increasingly common in recent years, including at postal facilities.\r\n\r\nI am requesting any records or documentation related to complaints or investigations of violations of Article 7, in relation to videoing and photography, at postal facilities or involving postal inspectors and or postal employee staff . This includes complaints related to First Amendment auditing.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any letters, memoranda, reports, emails, or other records related to these complaints or investigations, including any records of disciplinary action taken against postal employees or inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",
