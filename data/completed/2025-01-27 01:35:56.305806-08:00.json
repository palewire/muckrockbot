        "communication": "Hello Brian,\r\n\r\nThis email shall act as the Planning Department's response to your request\r\nfor public records. This response applies only to records that exist and\r\nare in the custody of the Planning Department. (See \"A Guide to the\r\nMassachusetts Public Records Law\", (2022) p. 32, n. 115).\r\n\r\n\u202fSpecifically, you requested:\r\n\r\n*\"...all emails from Dec 2024 related to the Boston Water and sewer\r\nproject.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n\u202fThere is a\u202fpresumption\u202funder the Massachusetts Public Records Law that\r\ngovernment records are public; however, government records custodians are\r\npermitted to redact or withhold portions of public records, so long as a\r\nspecific exemption to the law is cited.\u202f(See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))\r\n\r\nThe Planning Department has exercised (2) exemptions in reviewing your\r\nrequest:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Privacy Exemption: We have redacted the personal email addresses and\r\n   cell phone numbers belonging to individuals that appear in the responsive\r\n   records. When redacting this personal information, the Planning\r\n   Department relied upon the second clause of the privacy exemption set forth\r\n   in *G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c)*. It is the position of the Planning\r\n   Department that the release of personal email addresses and cell phone\r\n   numbers would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In\r\n   taking this position, the Planning Department believes that such\r\n   information constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" as\r\n   personal email addresses and cell phone numbers are not typically otherwise\r\n   available for public consumption. In weighing the protection of privacy\r\n   interests versus the public interest in disclosure, the Planning Department\r\n   ultimately determines that providing this information would amount to an\r\n   unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the individuals. Further, any\r\n   public interest in the disclosure of personal email addresses and cell\r\n   phone numbers does not outweigh the privacy interest held by the\r\n   individuals.\r\n\r\n   2. The Deliberative Process Exemption: We have withheld (2) emails and\r\n   (2) working drafts of a Purchase and Sale Agreement based on the\r\n   Deliberative Process Exemption. The Deliberative Process Exemption is\r\n   intended to avoid release of materials that could taint the deliberative\r\n   process if prematurely disclosed. Its application is limited to\r\n   recommendations on legal and policy matters found within an ongoing\r\n   deliberative process that are contained within inter-agency or intra-agency\r\n   memoranda or letters. The City's internal planning for the development\r\n   of the BWSC Parking Lots is ongoing and, as such, any and all documents\r\n   concerning the City's ongoing internal planning are protected from\r\n   disclosure under the deliberative process exemption. (See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7\r\n   7(26)(d))\r\n\r\nIn answer to your public records request, please find the responsive\r\nrecords through the link below:\r\n\r\n*PRR 12.18.2024 - BWSC Communications_December 2024*\r\n<https://bpda.box.com/s/9t0zx85m15p5m5ae0ikfy7sps4b2ql9v>\r\n\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. (G.L. c.\r\n66,\u202f\u00a7\u202f10A; 950 CMR 32.08)\nBest,\r\nDanielle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*----*\r\n\r\nDanielle Cournoyer (pronouns she/her/hers)\r\n\r\n Public Records Specialist\r\n\r\n Planning Department\r\n\r\n City of Boston\r\n\r\n 617-918-4448 (w)",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request all records related to or mentioning Anita Perry's participation in Department of Energy delegations and foreign trips. Records should include, but are not limited to, written and electronic correspondence regarding her participation, records related to the cost of her travel, her qualifications, and her official duties and schedule as a member of these delegations. I also request all memoranda and records related from the Office of General Counsel's review of Anita Perry's participation in department delegations. \r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy press office confirmed Anita Perry's participation as a delegate in at least two foreign trips in this E&E News report:\r\nhttps://www.eenews.net/stories/1060065063\r\nThe story also contains DOE's confirmation of the Office of General Counsel's review of Anita Perry's participation in department delegations.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the news media, I request a waiver of fees for this request. I am a reporter whose work has been published with McClatchy Newspapers, The Investigative Fund and Al Jazeera English. I am currently pursuing journalistic projects in the employ of outlets including The Investigative Fund, Climate Home and MuckRock. I am requesting this information for the purposes of newsgathering for MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFrank Matt",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Ms. Miller,\r\n\r\nWe have received the request you submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for:\r\n    1. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the words \"Omicron\" and/or \"B.1.1.529\" and/or \"GR/484A\" and/or \"21K\" between the dates of 1/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n    2. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"breakthrough\" between the dates of 1/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n    3. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"effectiveness\" between the dates of 1/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\nBased on past searches of Dr. Fauci's emails, this request will be exceedingly voluminous.  Please be advised that there is an extensive backlog at this time and the FOIA requires us to process requests in the order they were received.  Also, because of Dr. Fauci's dual role, requests for his emails must also be reviewed by NIH, HHS, and the White House prior to release. Thus, defining your search parameters as narrowly as possible will assist us in getting materials to you as timely as possible.  Suggestions for narrowing this request include: amending the request to emails sent by Dr. Fauci (this will mostly exclude spam and news clips and will better target Dr. Fauci's actual communications on a subject); reducing the time frame from over a year to two to four weeks or less; and excluding attachments. Broad terms like \"effectiveness\" seldom generate useful results unless combines with other limiting terms.  Combining terms to target a request to a specific area rather than just requesting tens of thousands of pages has been an effective strategy for our successful requesters.  For example:\r\nAll emails sent by Dr. Fauci for the time period <recommend 2-4 weeks> containing the terms ((\"Omicron\" OR \"B.1.1.529\" OR \"GR/484A\" OR \"21K\") AND \"breakthrough\") excluding attachments.\r\nLastly, I again ask you to kindly provide links to material supporting your request to be classified as a \"freelance journalist\" and therefore not subject to fees.  The search fees for this search will be significant so I will await your response to request the search.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRobin L.

To ensure that my request is fulfilled completely, please make sure to specifically certify that no other responsive documents exist beyond those provided by your agency as part of this request at the time of their delivery to me.\r\n\r\nRegarding your request for links to prove my status as a freelance journalist, you can view my portfolio at the following link: https://www.erinmariemiller.com/clips\r\n\r\nI have previously been classified as a media requester by the CDC under the FOIA and see no reason why my status would be any different with the NIH.

If you need any further information, please feel free to reach out.\r\n\r\nAs far as your suggestions for narrowing my search, feel free to narrow my search to the following parameters instead:\r\n\r\n- All emails sent by Dr. Fauci between 11/1/2021 and 1/6/2022 containing the terms (\"Omicron\" OR \"B.1.1.529\" OR \"GR/484A\" OR \"21K\") AND \"breakthrough\" including all attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the responsive documents must be reviewed by such a large number of government officials and agencies before they are provided to me, I would like to ensure that the complete set of responsive documents makes its way to me, even if some of those documents include redactions. To ensure that my request is fulfilled completely, please make sure to specifically certify that no other responsive documents exist beyond those provided by your agency as part of this request at the time of their delivery to me.\r\n\r\nRegarding your request for links to prove my status as a freelance journalist, you can view my portfolio at the following link: https://www.erinmariemiller.com/clips\r\n\r\nI have previously been classified as a media requester by the CDC under the FOIA and see no reason why my status would be any different with the NIH. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am willing to pay up to $25 for this request. If the fee exceeds that amount, please notify me for permission prior to beginning work on the request.\r\n\r\nThank you again,\r\n\r\nErin Miller",

All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the words \"Omicron\" and/or \"B.1.1.529\" and/or \"GR/484A\" and/or \"21K\" between the dates of 10/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\n2. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"breakthrough\" between the dates of 10/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\n3. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"effectiveness\" between the dates of 10/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\nNone of the search terms cited in this request should be interpreted by your agency as being case sensitive during the search and retrieval process while fulfilling this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents and information will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a freelance journalist whose work is frequently published in print and online by news outlets and magazines at the local, regional and national levels. As a member of the media, I request a waiver of all fees. Because more than a year has elapsed since my request was submitted on 12/21/2021, I expect that your office will provide all of the requested records at no charge, as required by federal law regardless of my media status.\r\n\r\nBecause my request was filed over two years ago, I also expect that your office will provide the requested records as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlese feel free to contact me at this email address if you need any additional information, or if you have any questions. Because this request has taken so long, I prefer that all communications regarding my request be in writing moving forward, in case I need to pursue legal action against your office to obtain the requested records.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Miller",

This investigation is known to have used mail covers. The following file numbers are associated with Penetrate: 65-HQ-67842, 65-SJ-398, 65-MM-2940. The HQ file number is also cited in previously released records on MIRA, which potentially identify Penetrate as Filiberto Inocencio Ojeda-Rios, the subject of a 1970 fugitive case (https://archive.org/details/MovimentoIndependentistaRevolucionarioEnArmas/SJ-100-12315_4_04_70/page/n75/mode/2up).\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Documents that are not in the possession of the City, including documents that do not exist, are not public records. And, Ohio public entities have no obligation to create records in response to a request, or to compile information from existing records to create a new record, if a responsive record does not already exist. See State ex rel. Kerner v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., 82 Ohio St.3d 273 (Ohio 1998) and State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154 (Ohio 1999). \r\nThe records have been released to the City of Cincinnati Public Records Center. You can log into the system by clicking the following link and download your responsive records. \r\nCity Public Records Request - C005520-112124 \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nChelsea Milligan \r\nAdministrative Technician",

EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a01.6(a)(1)(D) information (in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to EO 13526)\r\nl.

If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Sai:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on November 4, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201call other\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  Your fee waiver request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2025-DA-01536-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Gina Lee at (202) 692-5228 or electronically at Gina.Lee@usda.gov<mailto:Gina.Lee@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA.<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB3119.43C2B9A0]\r\nGina Lee\r\nFOIA Analyst Contractor\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFOIA Division\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\n1400 Independence Ave., SW\r\nWashington, DC  20250\r\n\u260e  (202) 692-5228\r\n\u2709   Gina.Lee@usda.gov<mailto:Gina.Lee@usda.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

This request is made solely to raise public awareness and for educational purposes. I believe this issue holds considerable public interest, particularly in light of a December 2012 article, which stated the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had been investigating allegations of human trafficking within the Church of Scientology. The investigation may have been conducted by the Tampa field office, with lead investigator Justin Deutsch.\r\n\r\nHere is the article referencing the investigation.\r\n\r\nhttps://tonyortega.org/2012/12/13/homeland-security-investigating-scientology-for-human-trafficking/\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCassie Sipe",

Your request was received in this office on 8/23/2024. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-ICFO-55733. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

I am able to receive these files via USB, CD, DVD, or other digital formats, if available. I am requesting, specifically, audio from the dates of December 5th, 6th, and 7th. in the year 2022. As law requires, the retention of E911 audio should be available for no less than one year, this request will hopefully be fairly easy to fulfill.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHTP",

The files I'm mentioning are:\r\nFrom November Emails:\r\nSV223390163_911_Call.wav\r\nSV223390165_911_Call.wav\r\n[...]\r\nSV223410234_911_Call.wav\r\n\r\nWhereas the second batch of calls and radio traffic you provided (December emails) came with both 911 calls as well as the radio traffic, the above batch of calls did not. For example:\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390177_911_Call.wav.m4a\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390177_Radio_Traffic.wav.m4a\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390185_911_Call.wav.m4a\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390185_Radio_Traffic.wav.m4a\r\n\r\nThe Radio Traffic portion seems to be missing. Did it hopefully get processed and saved somewhere accessible, but possibly just not attached? If the files can be found, please attach them when you can.\r\n\r\nIf the files are no longer available, I'm not going to request that you re-work this request, rest assured. However, I am hopeful that the other data may be available and that this might just have an easy resolution!\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well,\r\nTake care.",

Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file. \r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel \r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow \r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/peter.fugiel/140788/2024-08-01_C169558_Fugiel-LEG_Seattle-Council-select-metadata.csv \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-council-219%252Fselect-secure-scheduling-council-emails-170805%252F%253Femail%253Dmuckrockseattle%252540mycusthelp.net&url_auth_token=AAAbJQToMIQHI1KMRcuzZrve4-c%3A1sZjGp%3AGHU1GXum0pus9tCKOc9CIy8O4-AZfCBLGClic8gMa1s \r\nThe records being made available to you at this time include 2/3rds of the records you indicated. \r\nTo download your records, please: \r\n \r\n  * Navigate to the Public Records Request Center. \r\n  * Select 'My Records Request Center'. \r\n  * Select 'View My Requests'.

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is November 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Dear Kristopher Rios:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on June 14, 2024. The request was originally submitted to the Department of Veteran Affairs, who then routed the request to the OIA.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201call other\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2024-REE-05419-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Mr. Nicholas Mantzaris electronically at Nicholas.Mantzaris@usda.gov<mailto:Nicholas.Mantzaris@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DABE63.025B0450]\r\nNicholas Mantzaris\r\nFOIA Analyst - Contractor\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\n1400 Independence Ave., SW, Room 4049D\r\nWashington, DC 20250\r\n(202) 690-5228\r\n\u2709     Nicholas.Mantzaris@USDA.gov<mailto:Nicholas.Mantzaris@USDA.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records captioned, labeled, mentioned or describing Major Case 216.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
