In an effort to provide you with the specific records that will be most helpful to you, by way of this e-mail, we ask for your assistance in clarifying and narrowing your request.\r\n\r\nUCLA does not operate on a centralized system, and as such, we must reach out to a custodian directly. We are not able to search in a centralized system for all University records (or the records of an entire department such as UCLA police department) to figure out who may be the holder of a certain document or email.\r\n\r\nBecause your request currently lists no names of UCLA staff whose records you specifically seek, we request that you specify UCLA staff names and/or titles. Otherwise, we are not able to conduct a search for records.\r\n\r\nWe will keep your request open for 10 business days from the date of this email.\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nUCLA Information Practices\r\nrecords@ucla.edu\r\n(310) 794-8741",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Rose Terse,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 2025, the City of Medina Police Department received your public records request for the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords related to the department\u2019s Flock Safety system:\r\n\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\n\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period of December 1, 2024, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\n\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period of December 1, 2024, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\n\r\n3. A list of network share settings that include:\r\n\r\n3a. Flock networks shared with me\r\n\r\n3b. Networks that I\u2019m sharing\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in their original electronic, machine readable format. For example, please provide csv or spreadsheet files where applicable. Please do not redirect me to your transparency portal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City was able to provide records for the following:\r\n\r\n* Organization Audit in Flock - released on 6-12-2025\r\n\r\n      3a. Flock networks share with me - released on 5-22-2025\r\n\r\n      3b. Networks that I'm sharing - released on 5-22-2025\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding request #2. Network Audit in Flock, the City has no public records meeting the description.  Our agency did not own, prepare, use, retain, or possess, or access the records that you are requesting and therefore, these are not public records under the State Public Records Act.  To be a \"public record\" under Public Records Act, information must be (1) a writing (2) related to the conduct of government or the performance of government functions that is (3) prepared, owned, used, or retained by a state or local agency.  Here, these records do not meet that criteria.  See Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 880-882 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City has determined that your request has been fulfilled. This is now considered closed. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.550(6), you have one year from the date of this letter to seek judicial review of this request. If you have any questions regarding your request, please respond within twenty (20) days of this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBarbara Marxer\r\n\r\nMedina PD\r\n\r\nRecords\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Medina, WA.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

As you know, your request specifically sought \"[r]ecords that detail the extent of your office's usage of GPS technology to monitor people in the Sheriff's office's custody. This includes individuals under pretrial, sentences, on SORB, or any other custodial status. If such a program exists, I request records that show the number of individuals currently on GPS monitors, and their status.\"\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Essex County Sheriff's Department has multiple facilities - the Middleton House of Correction in Middleton, MA, the Essex County Pre-Release and Re-Entry Center (\"ECPRC\") in Lawrence, MA, and the Women in Transition (\"WIT\") facility in Salisbury, MA. I am advised by Department officials that every inmate at the ECPRC, both sentenced and pretrial inmates, has a GPS monitoring device. The Department reserves the right to place a GPS monitoring device on a sentenced inmate at the WIT if the Department deems it necessary.\r\n\r\nWhile you requested data on the number of inmates with GPS monitoring, the overall number fluctuates daily due to new intakes, releases, etc. As of June 23, 2025, the total number was 100 - the breakdown was 92 sentenced and 8 pretrial. There are also 3 sentenced inmates who have GPS monitoring but are not in the Department's direct custody.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJordan Elizabeth Mitchell\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nEssex County Sheriff's Department\r\n20 Manning Avenue\r\nMiddleton, MA 01949",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

These and other records thus made available will, we hope and expect, be referenced in research papers and other writings, and the mere availability of them makes the public aware of an entire field of government operations (namely, collaboration with Hollywood) of which the public is largely not aware. This increased awareness, in turn, has the potential to transform the way the public sees films. Furthermore, I am the editor-in-chief of a research magazine published by said foundation  called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" to which I also contribute articles (including a recent article on NASA's relationship to Hollywood). The magazine explores, among other topics, Hollywood's relationship to the federal government, and such documents indeed are cited in the magazine.\r\n\r\nI therefore repeat my request for a waiver of fees, having rebutted the finding that this work does not contribute in any significant way to the public's understanding of government. \r\n\r\nIn the event that this waiver request is not accepted, I still wish you to process the FOIA request, under the stipulations stated in the original request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

        "communication": "Good Afternoon MuckRock News and Alisia Rios:\r\n\r\nPlease note that in the state of Maryland, \"Under GP \u00a7 4-206, an official custodian may charge reasonable fees for the search and preparation of records for inspection and copying.[...] Search fees are the costs to an agency for locating requested records. Usually, this involves the cost of an employee\u2019s time spent in locating the requested records. Preparation fees are the costs to an agency to prepare a record for inspection or copying, including the time needed to assess whether any provision of law permits or requires material to be withheld.\"  See Maryland Public Information Act Manual.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court of Maryland has indicated that an agency may appropriately require prepayment of fees. See Glass v. Anne Arundel County, 453 Md. 201, 212-13 (2017). And, requesting prepayment of fees before providing responsive records does not amount to a denial of the request. Glass , 453 Md. at 236-37.\r\n\r\nYour request dated March 6, 2025, which was received on March 18, 2025, is broadly worded and would require diversion of resources to conduct an exhaustive search. Therefore, the college is requesting that you (1) focus your request on specific records that are not already accessible via the college\u2019s website or otherwise publicly available, (2) confirm your willingness to pay the estimated associated fees for fulfilling this search prior to commencement of such search, and (3) if more time is required than estimated, pay any additional fees prior to the release of responsive records (if any). To be clear, the college has not denied your request.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://howardcc.libguides.com/bot, which contains many records regarding the governance and operations of the college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nDelisle Warden\r\n\r\nVice President for Policy and General Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice: 443.518.4470\r\nhowardcc.edu<http://www.howardcc.edu/>\r\n\r\n[cid:120ce402-016f-416d-984e-93c3efd29d61]\r\nThis email may contain material that is confidential, privileged, or attorney work product for the sole use of the intended recipient.

After reviewing the president's list again, the classifications seem to be cut off, preventing me from being able to make an appropriate match. Also, I noticed that the salary schedule in the CBA is titled \"B.\" The president's report had various grades for incumbents, starting on page 12, that do not seem to line up with the one on the CBA \"B\". Some have grades 1-7, and the salary structure starts at 8. Also, some have different letters and numbers that are not indicated in the CBA. (Pages 1-11 have no classifications or grades.). Is it possible that I don't have the appropriate CBA?",

These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for information, that information is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the information is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort.&nbsp;The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City is typically afforded ten (10 days) from the date of receipt of your request to make a determination whether your request seeks disclosable public records.&nbsp;In accordance with the California Public Records Act, pursuant to Government Code section 7922.535(c)(1)-(4), the City will require an extension of that deadline of up to an additional fourteen (14) days to make such a determination because of the reasons checked as follows:\r\n\r\n[ X ]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to search for and collect the requested records from facilities separate from the office processing the request.\r\n\r\n[&nbsp;X ]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.\r\n\r\n[ X ]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for consultation with another department or agency that has substantial interest in the response to the request.\r\n\r\n[&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to compile data, to write programming language or a computer program, or to construct a computer report to extract data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the City will determine whether it possesses records responsive to your Request on or before May 19, 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of San Rafael, CA.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

A comparable request submitted recently to another regional law enforcement agency was processed with a significantly shorter timeline and a projected fulfillment date of May 27, 2025. This suggests that the records I\u2019ve requested\u2014 which are routinely maintained by public agencies\u2014 may be reasonably accessible without requiring such an extended delay.\r\n\r\nI understand that some of the materials may require review or redaction. However, under RCW 42.56.520, agencies are required to provide the \u201creasonable estimate\u201d of time necessary to produce records, and I respectfully ask for more detail as to what is contributing to this 60-business-day estimate.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I also request that responsive records be released on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than in a single, delayed release. I am open to narrowing or prioritizing specific sections of my request to assist in timely fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and attention. I look forward to your response and hope to work collaboratively to ensure the timely release of these important public records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAurora Quinn",

Salary Records: Current and historical salary data for all personnel, including base pay, overtime, special assignment pay, and bonuses. \r\nI will be coordinating your records request with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). My apologies for the very long estimate that was initially sent to you. I was out of town and one of the records staff at JCSO sent that estimate based on their perception of the size of your request. We do actually intend to produce records by installment as records are located, compiled and review is completed. A few of your request items are relatively simple and can correspondingly be produced relatively quickly. However, unless I'm misunderstanding any details, the overall scope of your request appears to be massive. I have taken the liberty of numbering each of the bulleted items in your request, for ease of reference. I would guess that 27 of your requests, taken together, comprise a significant portion, probably a majority, of all of JCSO's administrative records. Many of the requested records will require detailed review and redaction which is a time-consuming process. Some of the requested records will also require third party notice to be sent to subjects of the records, which will also add to the overall processing time for those records. Given limitations in personnel and the need to prevent excessive interference with other essential operations, it will take a period of many months to complete all 27 items of your request. But, as I mentioned, we will produce records by installment as they are compiled, prepared and reviewed. Some of the records you are requesting exist in paper files only. The county charges 10 cents a page for scans of paper records, so there will be some charges for certain installments along the way. The total cost of all charges will almost certainly be well in excess of $25. Each time we anticipate charges for a certain installment, we will first send you an estimate of the charges, showing an estimate of the number of pages to be scanned. We estimate that public records responsive to this request will be available within nine business days from today, on or before 5/30/2025. If public records become available in advance of this estimate we will contact you promptly. Conversely, if the County encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will contact you promptly with a revised estimated date. Thank you for your patience in awaiting this information.

I appreciate your transparency about the challenges involved, including the time required for review, redaction, and third-party notifications, as well as the potential costs associated with scanning paper records.\r\nUnderstanding the broad nature of my request, I want to be mindful of limiting costs and minimizing any operational burden on Jefferson County. To that end, I would be happy to work with you to identify an initial set of 10\u201315 high-priority categories that can be compiled and released earlier in the process. If you could advise which of the requested items are more readily accessible or less resource-intensive to produce, that would help me focus the request accordingly. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide a simple tracking update or log indicating the current status of each category as they move through review and preparation. This would help me monitor progress and plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your willingness to produce records on a rolling basis and for providing advance estimates of any anticipated charges. I look forward to receiving the first installment of records by May 30, 2025, or sooner if available, and to working collaboratively toward a transparent and timely resolution.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAurora Quinn",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\nHello Aurora, \r\nWe have reviewed each of the items in your request and identified a few items which can be completed expeditiously. We have also identified some other items for which we have either no responsive records or very few responsive records. Unless you have any objection, we will process those requests first and then move on to larger and more time-consuming requests. The items we identified for this \"first round\" are numbers \r\n1, 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, and 20. \r\nYou asked for something like a tracking update or log to track the progress of each item.\u00a0 The best way to approach this is to create a new request in our public records request system for each item when we begin working on it. These will be essentially sub-requests. The sub-requests will give both you and us an easy way to track the progress of each item. All of the records produced for an item will be stored in that item's sub-request and provided via the sub-request. Also all communication regarding each item, including time estimates for providing installments of records can also be conducted via the corresponding sub-request. All of the sub-requests will appear as individual requests in your account and each of them will have its own reference number that gets generated when it's entered. I'll be creating a few of these sub-requests today and you'll get an automatic acknowledgement email from each one as it's created. \r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or objections about any of this. \r\nThank you, Ken Hugoniot \r\nJefferson County Public Records Administrator \r\n1820 Jefferson St. \r\nPort Townsend, WA 98368 \r\n(360) 385-9174 \r\nkhugoniot@co.jefferson.wa.us (mailto:khugoniot@co.jefferson.wa.us)",

Before proceeding with payment or next steps, I would like to take time to refine the scope of the requested records to ensure clarity and reduce unnecessary time and cost for both parties.\r\n\r\nI am currently reviewing the following 27 requested items and will be preparing a refined, tiered list identifying:\r\n\u2022\tWhich items apply to current employees only vs. former employees (and how many years back, e.g., last 3\u201310 years),\r\n\u2022\tWhich apply specifically to sworn officers vs. administrative staff,\r\n\u2022\tWhich categories should be prioritized first for delivery.\r\n\r\nI also acknowledge that you have already provided:\r\n\u2022\tThe personnel roster of current employees (Item #1) via the Muckrock portal,\r\n\u2022\tA formal response indicating no responsive records for Item #10 (Early Intervention System Data),\r\n\u2022\tA formal response indicating no responsive records for Item #20 (Body-Worn Camera Misuse or Policy Violations).\r\n\r\nWhile I reserve the right to revisit these items or seek administrative appeal later, if necessary, I will focus for now on refining the scope of the remaining requests. Please also note that I intend to process all communications and records delivery solely through the Muckrock portal to keep everything centralized. Once I finalize and submit the refined list, I will follow up regarding payment arrangements and next steps.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation.

One of those reports (EEO4-GEMS_2015-2022) was generated for this records request from data that remains from the legacy database. The other two reports were previously generated in the legacy database in 2017 and 2015 and were located among files maintained by human resources.

The Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (PAO) provided two versions of their Brady list. The list in PDF format is the currently used list which is more up to date. The Excel spreadsheet version is the previously-used version which is no longer kept up to date, but it contains some information that is not included in the current list. The PAO issues potential impeachment disclosure (PID)\u00a0letters pertaining to both Jefferson County Sheriff officers and Port Townsend Police Department officers, so those are included in the responsive records. Please log in at the following link to retrieve your responsive records: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003642-052225  These may be all of the responsive records, but it appears that there is at least one PID letter missing. I will need to inquire with the PAO regarding any remaining unlocated records. Meanwhile, if you have any additional questions or issues pertaining to the records produced in this installment, please don't hesitate to contact me. If any additional records are located, we estimate the next installment to this request will be available within five\u00a0business days from today, on or before 7/11/2025. If you experience any difficulties accessing the Public Records Center or downloading your documents, please contact me as soon as possible for assistance. Sincerely, Ken Hugoniot \r\nPublic Records Administrator \r\nCentral Services \r\nJefferson County \r\n360-385-9174",

Dear Aurora  Quinn, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office received the following public records request from you on April 30, 2025: (3) Internal Affairs Complaints Logs \r\nPlease provide logs or records of complaints filed against sworn officers from January 1, 2015 to the present, including: \r\n* Date of complaint \r\n* Name(s) of officer(s) involved \r\n* Badge number(s) \r\n* Nature/type of complaint \r\n* Summary of allegations \r\n* Status and outcome \r\n* Date investigation closed \r\n* Disciplinary action taken (if any) \r\nIn response to your records request, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has provided the full internal affairs log that is maintained by their office. The log includes all types of internal affairs incidents combined in one table. In addition to complaints the log includes use of force incidents, pursuits, workplace injuries and equipment/vehicle damage incidents. The log does not include: \r\nBadge number \r\nDate investigation closed The disposition column contains a small amount of information about disciplinary action taken for investigations that were upheld, but the information doesn't appear to be entirely consistent. For current employees, badge numbers can be located by cross-referencing employee names from the IA log with names in the current employee roster, which I've included in the downloads with the IA log file. Since the records of all investigations will be provided to you in response to other items in your overall records request, those documents will include all the details of the investigations, including the date that the investigations were closed and any disciplinary action that was taken. Please log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve your responsive documents: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003640-052225  All responsive records have been produced and the request is now closed. This completes, closes, and provides Jefferson County's final, definitive response to this request. If you have any difficulty retrieving your documents, please contact me for assistance as soon as possible. Jefferson County will take no further action on this request. If you have questions regarding the processing of this request or would like to initiate an administrative appeal regarding the response to your request, please do so at your earliest opportunity.\u00a0You may also seek judicial review of our response to your request for a period of one year, beginning as of the date of this message, consistent with RCW 42.56.550.

Your request was received by this office on October 24, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA. Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as an \u201dnews media\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1 Section 2(b)(4)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords containing the following statistics for the academic years indicated:\r\n\r\n1. Number of Honor Court Complaints or referrals (by source, such as cadet, faculty, staff, other, if possible) to the VMI Honor Court by academic year, race, ethnic background, and gender (further broken out by race and ethnic background), also identified as athlete or non-athlete.\r\n\r\n2. Number of the Honor Court Complaints in #1 that were investigated by the same demographic breakdown.\r\n\r\n3. Number of Honor Court Investigations in #2 that where Honor Court Charges were referred to the Superintendent for trial by the same demographic breakdown and indicated as approved for further action or disapproved by the Superintendent by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n4. Number of Cadets charged by the Honor Court whose charges were dismissed by the Superintendent based on pre-trial motions or for other reasons (with reasons if available) by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n5. Number of Cadets charged by the Honor Court who pleaded guilty to the charges by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n6. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court and found innocent by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n7. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court, Found Guilty and dismissed by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n8. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court, Found Guilty, whose cases the Superintendent subsequently dismissed and allowed them to stay at VMI by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n9. Number of Honor Court Cases where the Honor Court charged cadets but the Superintendent used his authority to adjudicate the case while the Corps was away from VMI (Summer Break, Furloughs, etc.) under the authority granted to him by the changes to the Honor System to make it more equitable by the exact demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n10. Number of Honor Court Convictions appealed to the Board of Visitors Appeals Committee, and the result (appeal granted or denied) by the same demographic breakdown.\r\n\r\nData requested for the following Academic Years\r\n\r\n2019 - 2020\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nPreviously, similar statistics were made public through the media and the Barnes and Thornburg Investigation report before the requested years. The outgoing VMI Superintendent highlighted his accomplishments in ensuring racial equity, specifically for Black cadets. Still, the VMI Board of Visitors has not released his performance data in response to questions raised regarding their decision not to renew his contract. Other public documents contain statements regarding his successful efforts to provide personal oversight, review in these areas, and offenses, and prevent biased application of disciplinary actions (particularly against Black Cadets) to ensure equity. This updated data is relevant for the public to know the impact of his involvement in these areas identified as issues in the investigation.\r\n\r\nThis request is specifically NOT requesting any Personally Identifying Information (PII) on any of the individuals involved. VMI no longer announces the names of cadets dismissed for Honor Violations and those involved in Honor Court Cases are strictly prohibited from disclosing the the identities of these cadets, so there is no situation where this general information, which it is reasonably expected must be maintained to meet the committments to equity in the One Corps, One VMI Plan, responses to the Barnes and Thornburg Report, and VMI's repeated Committment to making changes to the honor ssystem so it is more equitable woudl violated any current or former cadet's privacy.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables. \r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if school districts or job titles are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so. \r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Cadet rank announcements or other records with a breakout by race, gender, and athlete vs non-athlete for the following academic years:\r\n\r\nAY 2020 - 2021\r\nAY 2021 - 2022\r\nAY 2022 - 2023\r\nAY 2023 - 2024\r\nAY 2024 - 2025\r\nAY 2025 - 2026\r\n\r\nSome of this information is posted, such as https://www.vmi.edu/news/headlines/2024-2025/cadets-lead-the-way-rank-announcements-celebrated.php, but it does not include race, gender, or NCAA status.\r\n\r\n2. The targets or goals VMI set for diversity in leadership (rank opportunities) by race, gender, athlete, and non-athlete for the AYs listed above.\r\n\r\nMaj. Gen. Wins and the VMI Inclusive Excellence program set goals for diversity and publicized successes in making the Corps more diverse in its makeup and, especially, in rank opportunities, while increasing leadership opportunities for cadets. It appears from the recent list that there was success in this area, but it is difficult to determine without the statistics, and for these successes, there should be goals to determine if they were met.\r\n\r\nIf these are available by links, I am willing to accept those.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

For AY 2024 - 2025 - The Honor Court Procedures Manual, Poster, and/or Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) (However it is termed)\r\n2. For AY 2024 - 2025 - Honor Court  Voting Ballot for trials with any instructions or guidance given orally or in writing.\r\n3. For AY 2024 - 2025 - Voting ballot for the Corps to elect Honor Court Members, with any instructions or guidance given orally or in writing.\r\n4. For AY 2024 - 2025 - Any instructions or guidance given orally or in writing to Honor Court witnesses.\r\n5. For AY 2024 - 2025 - Any training for Honor Court Members or Jurors\r\n6. The Final Report of the Superintendent's ad hoc committee that reviewed the Honor Court Standard Operating Procedures (HC SOP) and reported out to the Superintendent in August 2021.\r\n7. For AY 2021 - 2022, AY2022-2023, AY2023 - 2024, AY2024-2025, the reports developed by the The Honor Court, along with the Superintendent\u2019s Representatives to the Honor Court and in coordination with the Chief Diversity Officer  that, in accordane with VMI's implementation of the B&T Report recommendations, \"...includes demographic and DEI-related data\" and are \"...devoid of personal identifiable information, will facilitate an annual assessment of the effectiveness of these new measures in ensuring equity throughout the honor system.\u201d - Whereas these were specifically designed not to include PII, they should be fully releaseable.\r\n\r\nAll of these are standard current records (1-6) or records that VMI stated they will routinely maintain (7), so they should be readily available.'\r\n\r\nI AM ALSO REQUESTING THE MISSING DOCUMENTS FROM MY PREVIOUS FOIA  25 - 82, as The response you sent only included records up to AY 2020 - 2021.  THEY ARE MISSING AY 2022 - 2023, AY 2023 - 2024, AY 2024 - 2025. Also, this is missing some of the other information I requested, such as the number of cases referred for trial that the Superintendent dismissed either before trial or after conviction, with the same demographic breakdown. I said I would take incremental responses to my request as you gathered the files, but you never sent me any after the first tiny batch.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEND THEM\r\n\r\nUnder FOIA 25 - 82 I requested the following information:\r\n\r\n1. Number of Honor Court Complaints or referrals (by source, such as cadet, faculty, staff, other, if possible) to the VMI Honor Court by academic year, race, ethnic background, and gender (further broken out by race and ethnic background), also identified as athlete or non-athlete.\r\n\r\n2. Number of the Honor Court Complaints in #1 that were investigated by the same demographic breakdown.\r\n\r\n3. Number of Honor Court Investigations in #2 that where Honor Court Charges were referred to the Superintendent for trial by the same demographic breakdown and indicated as approved for further action or disapproved by the Superintendent by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n4. Number of Cadets charged by the Honor Court whose charges were dismissed by the Superintendent based on pre-trial motions or for other reasons (with reasons if available) by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n5. Number of Cadets charged by the Honor Court who pleaded guilty to the charges by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n6. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court and found innocent by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n7. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court, Found Guilty and dismissed by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n8. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court, Found Guilty, whose cases the Superintendent subsequently dismissed and allowed them to stay at VMI by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n9. Number of Honor Court Cases where the Honor Court charged cadets but the Superintendent used his authority to adjudicate the case while the Corps was away from VMI (Summer Break, Furloughs, etc.) under the authority granted to him by the changes to the Honor System to make it more equitable by the exact demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n10. Number of Honor Court Convictions appealed to the Board of Visitors Appeals Committee, and the result (appeal granted or denied) by the same demographic breakdown.\r\n\r\nData requested for the following Academic Years\r\n\r\n2019 - 2020\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nPreviously, similar statistics were made public through the media and the Barnes and Thornburg Investigation report before the requested years. The outgoing VMI Superintendent highlighted his accomplishments in ensuring racial equity, specifically for Black cadets. Still, the VMI Board of Visitors has not released his performance data in response to questions raised regarding their decision not to renew his contract. Other public documents contain statements regarding his successful efforts to provide personal oversight, review in these areas, and offenses, and prevent biased application of disciplinary actions (particularly against Black Cadets) to ensure equity. This updated data is relevant for the public to know the impact of his involvement in these areas identified as issues in the investigation.\r\n\r\nThis request is specifically NOT requesting any Personally Identifying Information (PII) on any of the individuals involved. VMI no longer announces the names of cadets dismissed for Honor Violations and those involved in Honor Court Cases are strictly prohibited from disclosing the the identities of these cadets, so there is no situation where this general information, which it is reasonably expected must be maintained to meet the committments to equity in the One Corps, One VMI Plan, responses to the Barnes and Thornburg Report, and VMI's repeated Committment to making changes to the honor ssystem so it is more equitable woudl violated any current or former cadet's privacy.\r\n\r\nThe response you sent only included records up to AY 2020 - 2021.  THEY ARE MISSING AY 2022 - 2023, AY 2023 - 2024, AY 2024 - 2025. - PLEASE SEND THEM.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that the dataset provided is raw data and may contain errors and/or omissions. Please be advised that the District does not comprehensively the track members of the Wellness Team at each CPS school. Thus, this portion of your request is asking the District to create a new record to answer your question. However, we are providing you with a dataset that lists the schools that have an active Wellness Team \r\nThe Freedom of Information Act requires a public body to provide existing public records, subject to certain exceptions. The request must reasonably describe the requested records. A reasonable description requires the record to be reasonably identified as a record not as a general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the [public body] does not generally create. (See Krohn v. Department of Justice, 628 F.2d 195 (1980)). Second,\u00a0 FOIA obligations apply to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32,\u00a0 \u00a0 540 N.E.2d 11, 13 (1989) (quoting Krohn v. Department of Justice, 628 F.2d 195, 198 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11.

There should be 34 pages in total.\r\n\r\nMy billing address is as follows:\r\n\r\nH Kordansky, \r\n11 Lord Austin Drive,\r\nBromsgrove,\r\nWorcestershire,\r\nB60 1RB,\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDawn Kordan\r\n\r\nPlease see below for the NARA (Francesca McCorkle) response which I have been asked to forward to you:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHello Dawn Kordan,\r\n\r\nI completed processing the records you requested from the National Archives\r\nand Records Administration under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) tracking\r\nnumber RD 88508.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to 100-HQ-440067 on Herbert Allen Kordan.\r\n\r\nI completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. Please be\r\nadvised, I have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing\r\nrecords and applying FOIA exemptions for this request. Information was\r\nreleased to the greatest extent possible. Below is a summary of my review:\r\n\r\nRecords Requested\r\n\r\nTotal Pages\r\n\r\nPages Released in Full\r\n\r\nPages Released in Part\r\n\r\n100-HQ-440067 on Herbert Allen Kordan\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nI withheld information protected under section (b) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C.\r\n552). The specific reasons for the denials are:\r\n\r\nTYPE OF INFORMATION WITHHELD\r\n\r\nFOIA EXEMPTION or STATUTE\r\n\r\nidentities of confidential sources\r\n\r\n(b)(7)(D)\r\n\r\nYou or your designated representative may view the file(s) at the National\r\nArchives at College Park, Maryland.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

Superior Court&nbsp;(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.&nbsp;In addition, some of the records you are requesting are not City records as they are not prepared, owned, used or retained by the City of Fremont. The City of Fremont is not an ALPR operator as defined in Civil Code section 1798.90.5. The aggregate data provided is all that is available. The City of Fremont has 97 mobile ALPR cameras.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the requests seek documents containing information gathered as part of an individual criminal investigation case file or intelligence file, these records are exempt from disclosure under Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 7923.600 and 7927.705 and Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1040(b)(2) and 1041.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent the requests seek records that are not part of an individual criminal investigation or intelligence file but would reveal the City\u2019s operational/technical strategies, confidential informants, the public interest in not disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in disclosing, since releasing such records to the public would jeopardize public safety, the safety of allied public safety agencies and the ability of the police to safely implement safety and security measures to protect the community.&nbsp;Furthermore, disclosure of this information to the public would allow individuals to defeat or avoid the City\u2019s efforts regarding public and officer safety, property protection, and apprehension of fleeing suspects.&nbsp;As a result, this information is exempt from disclosure under Government \u00a7 7922.000 and Evidence Code \u00a7 1040(b)(2).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent the requests seek information that is documented in copyrighted work or contain copyrighted work, federal law limits the reproduction by the City under the Copyright Act, 17 USC \u00a7 101 et seq. The City requires a waiver or permission from the copyright owner before reproducing copyrighted works. To the extent the request seeks information in documents containing business or industry information protected by the trade secret privilege, the City cannot disclose the information pursuant to Civil Code \u00a7 3426.1.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease note that the City is still in the process of searching and/or reviewing other potentially responsive documents. Assuming other responsive documents exist, the City will provide them to you as soon they are available. The City reserves the right to withhold and/or redact any records or information that may be exempt from disclosure under state or federal law, and/or other applicable legal privileges including, but not limited to deliberative process, attorney client, and attorney work product privileges. If there are records you feel should be disclosed notwithstanding this response, or you would like to discuss your requests and this response further, please respond using this portal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* D2 Policy Automated_License_Plate_Readers__ALPRs_.pdf\r\n\r\n* PRA 25-970 H1 FPD User List.xlsx\r\n\r\n* 25-970 E3 Camera Locations.xlsx\r\n\r\n* 2024 COPS TEP Application-Final.pdf\r\n\r\n* 2024 COPS TEP Award Package.pdf\r\n\r\n* PRA 25-970 B1 Detections past 30 days.pdf\r\n\r\n* PRA 25-970 B2 HITS 2025.pdf\r\n\r\n* Flock Safety Phase 2 Deployment Plan.eml\r\n\r\n* FW Fremont PD __ Flock Safety Update.eml\r\n\r\n* Re Advanced search.eml\r\n\r\n* Re Flock ALPR Extended Retention.eml\r\n\r\n* Re Flock Deployment and Quote.eml\r\n\r\n* Re Fremont camera locations.eml\r\n\r\n* Re FW Fremont PD __ Flock Safety Update.eml\r\n\r\n* G1 email 1.pdf\r\n\r\n* G1 email 2.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocument links are valid for one month.\r\n                   After July 20, you will need to sign in to view the document(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Fremont.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>\r\n",

This is the only platform we use to upload documents. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a response to the City of Fremont's Public Records Act request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the requests seek information that is not contained in identifiable records, the Public Records Act does not impose a duty on the City to create a record to respond to your request.&nbsp;Haynie v. Superior Court&nbsp;(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.&nbsp;In addition, some of the records you are requesting are not City records as they are not prepared, owned, used or retained by the City of Fremont. The City of Fremont is not an ALPR operator as defined in Civil Code section 1798.90.5. The aggregate data provided is all that is available. The City of Fremont has 97 mobile ALPR cameras.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the requests seek documents containing information gathered as part of an individual criminal investigation case file or intelligence file, these records are exempt from disclosure under Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 7923.600 and 7927.705 and Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1040(b)(2) and 1041.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent the requests seek records that are not part of an individual criminal investigation or intelligence file but would reveal the City\u2019s operational/technical strategies, confidential informants, the public interest in not disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in disclosing, since releasing such records to the public would jeopardize public safety, the safety of allied public safety agencies and the ability of the police to safely implement safety and security measures to protect the community.&nbsp;Furthermore, disclosure of this information to the public would allow individuals to defeat or avoid the City\u2019s efforts regarding public and officer safety, property protection, and apprehension of fleeing suspects.&nbsp;As a result, this information is exempt from disclosure under Government \u00a7 7922.000 and Evidence Code \u00a7 1040(b)(2).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent the requests seek information that is documented in copyrighted work or contain copyrighted work, federal law limits the reproduction by the City under the Copyright Act, 17 USC \u00a7 101 et seq. The City requires a waiver or permission from the copyright owner before reproducing copyrighted works. To the extent the request seeks information in documents containing business or industry information protected by the trade secret privilege, the City cannot disclose the information pursuant to Civil Code \u00a7 3426.1.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease note that the City is still in the process of searching and/or reviewing other potentially responsive documents.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?
