Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: or any other emails corresponding to this individual including jaromeg@earthlink.com, .\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2000 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request #1412777-000 for FBI records concerning File 062-HQ-62736, Postal Censorship.  The FBI has located approximately 83,000 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 523 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,335 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,875 days for processing.  \r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is June 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please respond to this email.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-4894\r\nStatus check?

I am appealing all applied exemptions in the records provided, particularly the application of b7e to records that are, at the time of my receiving them, eighty-three years old. The Bureau has previously disclosed law enforcement and intelligence techniques of this era, to include the interception of privileged diplomatic communications and collaboration with allied foreign intelligence services, methods that at the time would be highly damaging if disclosed but currently hold no value by remaining secret. The exemptions as applied in this release strain credulity and are prima facie absurd. I appreciate your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPaul Galante",

        "communication": "Dear Julieta Cardenas:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on April 8, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA. Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201cnews media\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nOnce we initiate processing, a search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case Number, 2024-OSEC-03866-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Olga Colacicco by email at olga.colacicco@usda.gov<mailto:olga.colacicco@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov%20>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

        "communication": "05/03/2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREFER TO:  218929/2017-0627 \n\nMs. Melissa Hill \nEmail: 32268-37981512@requests.muckrock.com \n\nDear Ms. Hill: \n\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act request dated 4/19/2017, and received by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on the same date, in which you requested records concerning Anarchism, Anarchist Extremism and/or Anarchist Extremists from 2015 to present. Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 218929.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 26 pages of responsive material.  Eight pages were found to be non-responsive and eight-teen pages are withheld in full. Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nWe are withholding third party information, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6). To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested. Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).  \nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees, under Exemption (b)(7)(C). Exemption (b)(7)(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The public interest under Exemption (b)(7)(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party. In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA, but rather, would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C).  \nWe are withholding specific law enforcement codes, techniques, and procedures used in our investigation pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(E) exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records or information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). The information withheld reveals various law enforcement file numbers and codes which are primarily used to store and retrieve law enforcement information. The information withheld also reveals specific law enforcement procedures and techniques used in this investigation. Disclosure of this information could enable individuals outside of the agency to circumvent agency functions and gain access to sensitive investigative information. Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to your FOIPA request #1422659-000 for FBI records concerning Legion of Doom. We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the extra-large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.fbi.gov%2Ffdps-1%2F%40%40search-fdps&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=B6S2vFgDgOWQqiCCwRvUsZQgDAHF1diXKG5fYH3T12M%3D&reserved=0> | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbi.gov%2Ffoia&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uaXvm%2Fg3l2HzET7puRKzFvk4XQEvSW%2FUHofbeKfFAng%3D&reserved=0> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D9F6A0.23F1CDF0][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]\n",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is Matthew Petti from the National Interest. I am writing in regards to your final response to my request,  2020-FQFO-01437. As you noted, you have transferred the request to Customs and Border Protection, presumably because some of the documents I requested originated in CBP. However, the following citatione appear to refer to DHS (and not CBP) documents:\r\n- DHS; IIR 4 006 0620 16; 27 FEB 2016; DOI 30 DEC 2015; Peluche HSO Transporting UDAS from Central America, Turkey, and China into the United States (footnote 8)\r\n- DHS; IIR 4 012 0079; 08 SEP 2016; DOI 14-24 APR 2016; Smuggling Routes and Methods from China to the United States (footnote 17)\r\n- DHS; IIR 4 042 0179 15; 29 MAY 2015; DOI 01 Mar 2015; CBP - Chinese Nationals Apprehended Near McAllen, Texas Provide Details of Their Travel Route to the United States (footnote 19)\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe your final response may have been made in error. Would you be able to reopen the request for just those three documents, or should I file a new one? I look forwards to hearing back from you soon.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMatthew",

The\r\nDistrict will begin to compile the information requested and determine\r\nwhether or not any of the information is believed to be confidential by law\r\nor excepted from public disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis process may take up to ten (10) business days. Should the District\r\nneed additional time to comply with your request, you will receive notice\r\nof the reason for the delay and an approximate date the information will be\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid diverting funds from the educational process, it may be necessary\r\nfor the District to recover the cost of providing the information. For\r\nexample, pursuant to Section 552.261 of the Texas Government Code, the\r\nDistrict will charge ten ($.10) cents per page for paper copies, if\r\napplicable. The District will pass along other costs incurred. In the event\r\nthat the charges for the information exceed $100.00 you may be required to\r\npost a cash bond before soft or hard copies are made. The district will\r\nprovide a cost estimate before processing requests anticipated to be\r\ngreater than $40.  Typically, there is no charge for information that is\r\nreadily available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or desire additional information, please feel\r\nfree to contact our office.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWendi Faughn\r\n\r\n\r\n<https://aldineisd.org/>\r\n\r\nWendi Faughn\r\n\r\nParalegal for Public Information Officer\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ashney Shelly*\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Department",

The request sought records related to water quality complaints and issues within the Albany, Schenectady, and Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) from January 1, 2018, to the present. I have not received a response, acknowledgment, or any communication from the Troy Water Department regarding my request. Pursuant to FOIL, the agency is required to respond within five business days.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, my original request sought the following information:\r\n\r\n1) The total number of water quality complaints received by your agency/authority/utility, broken down by year.\r\n2) A detailed summary of each water quality complaint, including the date, location, nature of the complaint, any actions taken, and the resolution or current status.\r\n3) Any reports, memos, or other documentation related to water quality complaints, investigations, and resolutions within the specified area and timeframe.\r\n\r\nI followed up on my original request with two subsequent emails on April 11, 2023, and April 26, 2023, requesting a response or an update on the status of my request. However, I have not received any acknowledgment or response from the Troy Water Department.\r\n\r\nThe summary denial of access to the requested records is in violation of FOIL. I respectfully request that you reconsider my request and provide the requested records or a valid explanation for withholding them within ten business days, as required by FOIL.\r\n\r\nIf my appeal is denied, please provide a written explanation for the denial and inform me of any further appeal procedures available under New York State law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to receiving your response.",

I appreciate your attention to this matter, and I would like to address some of the points you raised in your letter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I understand your concern about the method of submission and tracking of FOIL requests. However, I would like to clarify that my request was submitted through MuckRock, a widely recognized platform used for submitting and tracking FOIL requests. This platform is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and ease of use for both the requestor and the agency. It is not intended to circumvent any established procedures but to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the FOIL process.\r\n\r\nSecondly, regarding the issue of timeliness, I would like to remind you that according to Article 6 (Section 84-90) of the New York State's Freedom of Information Law, an agency is required to respond to a FOIL request within five business days of receipt. If the agency cannot provide the requested records within that timeframe, it must provide a written acknowledgment of receipt and a reasonable date by which the request will be granted or denied. In this case, I have not received such acknowledgment or estimated date.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to reiterate my commitment to working collaboratively with your agency to fulfill this FOIL request. I understand the importance of following proper procedures and am willing to cooperate fully to ensure that this process is carried out in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you reconsider your position and provide the requested records or a reasonable timeline for their provision. I look forward to your prompt response.",

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
