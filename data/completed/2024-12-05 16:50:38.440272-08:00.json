Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.

You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.

        "communication": "Respectfully, your response appears evasive. The original request identified the records with \"reasonable specificity\" given the limited information and vague statements by VMI officials. The VMI superintendent stated during BOV meetings and his representatives stated to the media and in other public forums that VMI requires  the cadet on staff of The Cadet newspaper to have a \"faculty advisor\" as a condition of recognition and receipt of what the superintendent and his staff repeatedly referred to as a \"Permit\" to operate. I cannot identify the specific record(s) that the Superintendent and his staff refer to that gives them this legal authority since no VMI administrator including the Superintendent has identified them to date. In fact, request specifically asked for \"all records substantiating and supporting the legal authority the VMI Superintendent has to direct an independent student newspaper have a faculty advisor or withold \"privileges\" (however VMI defines them) from cadets unless they agree to a faculty advisor.\" This request asks specifically for those records. The FOIA requirement for specificity is only so a reasonable person given the information can reasonably be expected to locate responsive records. It is not a requirement that each record be accurately names and specifically identified. I also gave you the opportunity to clarify if this directive is in the form of a lawful order that the Superintendent is somehow empowered to issue and provide that order and the supporting legal foundation for it.\r\n\r\nMaj. Gen. Wins publically stated that VMI supports freedom of speech \"under certain restraints\". He did not specify what those \"constraints\" are. The request asked specifically for \"all records of what those restraints and constraints are with their legal foundation relative to the First Amendment.\" \r\n\r\nIn both cases if the public knew what authorities, restraints and constraints Maj. Gen. Wins was referring to for these actions then there would not be a need to request them under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nDuring the ExCom by Maj. Gen. Wins stated that and a large number of the Commandant\u2019s staff and \u201cthe entire Executive Staff\u201d except the athletic director were involved in developing the Permit and the MOU. The statement was made that it was \u201cfully coordinated\u201d and ready to go. \"We've had the Dean personally involved taking, uh, taking a stab at getting this thing.... I would say that, umm, uh, it, it's a, it's been amazing to me that over, uh, the period of all this time that it's taken, uh, that it has taken the, the direct involvement of the Superintendent and/or the direct involvement of, uh, the Dean, uh, to get this done.\" Also, \" \"through the efforts of, uh, pretty much the entire executive staff, with the exception of the athletic director, we've been working on the development of a permit and an MOU for the eight or nine members of The Cadet staff. ... I think one of the things that, through this process, particularly with MY direct involvement we went back based on the direction I gave and, and we're gonna apply the permit just like we've applied every other permit.\" The request is specific as to all records related to these interactions. The FOIA requirement for specificity is only so a reasonable person given the information can reasonably be expected to locate responsive records. It is not a requirement that each record be accurately names and specifically identified.\r\n\r\nFinally, the request asks for \"all correspondence and other records of any kind sent to and/or received by VMI Board of Visitors President John Adams, former VMI BOV President Thomas Watjen, and/or VMI Supeintendent Cedric Wins sent to or from any person or organization, VMI and/or VMI Alumni Association staff, contractor and/or employees on the subject of The Cadet newspaper as well as any records, correspondence, records, etc. sent to or received from the VMI Alumni Agencies as well as internal VMI records regarding The Cadet newspaper for the period October 4, 2024 to the date the agency begins identifying records to fill my request.\" You filled a previous request for these same records but stated that records I requested and know to exist were not within the date range of my original request and so I needed to resubmit with a broader date range. You filled that request and you should be able to fill this one. To further clarify and eliminate what appears to be your confusion in this, the scope of this request is from the date of the last document provided in my previous request to the date of this reply to your comments. Whereas I cannot reasonably know who exactly sent correspondence to the BOV and exactly what institute officials were involved it is unreasonable to require I identify specific records and persons. The FOIA requirement for specificity is only so a reasonable person given the information can reasonably be expected to locate responsive records. It is not a requirement that each record be accurately names and specifically identified.\r\n\r\nI trust this clarifies the issue and my request will be filled expeditiously.\r\n",

Responsive documents include, but are not limited to, drafts and revisions of the proposed rule, testimony and recordings from public hearings, analyses, summaries, reports, memoranda, letters, emails and attachments prepared, issued, or received by the Commissioner, members of the Wage Board, or Department of Labor staff during the period 7/1/2017\u20136/30/2019. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made for non-commercial research purposes. The requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer to receive the responsive records in an electronic format through the online portal or by email attachment. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Additionally, access is denied to information which, if disclosed , would jeopardize the capacity of an agency or an entity that has shared information with an agency to guarantee the security of its information technology assets, such assets encompassing both electronic information systems and infrastructures pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (i).

If any responsive or cross-referenced records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, please provide all records related/pursuant to their destruction/transfer. This includes but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Confirmation of destruction and destruction slips\r\n- File Numbers or other forms of ID of the aforementioned destroyed records\r\n- Documents/records with any references to the destruction of the aforementioned destroyed records.\r\n- Transfer slips\r\n- Any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records\r\n\r\nI want **ALL** records identifiable with this request, even though reports based on those records may have been sent to department headquarters or other department offices, and even though there may be duplication between sets of files. Please produce all records with their administrative markings intact, and all reports, memos, and documents to include any and all administrative pages. In any responsive material, please black out rather than white out or cut out material.\r\n\r\nI request the administrative case file (including search slips and processing notes, i.e email correspondence and text messages) for this request. When searching email records, please search for any tracking information/identification assigned to this request, including but not limited to appeal number/ID, request number/ID, tracking number/ID, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nWherever possible, please release responsive documents as individual files. Compiling all responsive documents into a single PDF reduces accessibility and ease of use, providing unnecessary complication. \r\n\r\nGiven the anticipated amount of responsive pages, I'm requesting for interim releases of responsive records (otherwise known as a \"rolling release\"). \r\n\r\n**I ask that you understand that I am requesting any and all records concerning the subject in any way, including but not limited to those listed in the General Index and any and all other indexes.** \r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nDebra White Plume (Lakota: Wioweya Najin Win, August 20, 1954 \u2013 November 10, 2020) was a Lakota political activist and water protector. She fought to protect the traditional Oglala Lakota way of life. \r\n\r\nWhite Plume was born and raised on the Pine Ridge Reservation and was a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe. Her father was John Baptiste Reshaw, and her mother was Bernice Ione (Swallow) Stone.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, she was one of the first persons to join the American Indian Movement's Wounded Knee Occupation, which took place on her reservation in southwest South Dakota.\r\n\r\nWhite Plume founded Owe Aku (Bring Back the Way) in 1999, an advocacy group dedicated to cultural preservation and the protection of Lakota treaty rights through nonviolent direct action. She was the executive director of the group until her death. Her group also advocated for sobriety amongst Native Americans with the controversial slogan, \"Sober Indian, Dangerous Indian\", which she describes as the empowerment of oneself through traditional teachings with \"a mind free of manipulation, and clear thinking that creates an Indian who dares to stand up for the rights of his or her people and the rights of Mother Earth\".\r\n\r\nIn 2011, she was arrested outside the White House during a protest over the Keystone pipeline project. In 2015, she was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Cameco to stop it from expanding its operations at Crow Butte.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, she helped establish camps for protesters against the Dakota Access pipeline and played a leading role in organizing protests or nonviolent action against both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline protests. She stated while at Standing Rock: \"I'm Lakota, I'm a woman, and water is the domain of the women in our nation, and so it's our privilege and our obligation to protect water. If somebody wants to label me, I guess it would be water protector.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Quinn",

In addition, we are providing the records in PDF as we do not have the ability to securely release records in any other format.

Given that you are not claiming any exemptions, therefore nothing to redact, and your ability to \"securely\" release records is irrelevant. Likewise, you haven't claimed any withholding for the email headers or structural metadata, which were destroyed by your export to PDF, so those must be released as requested.\r\n\r\nThe form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C), (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA and FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508). Any email client or server can easily save the emails in one of the formats requested. It is \"readily reproducible in that form or format\", which is the legal standard.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

Sai \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR174937 \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRe:  2025-HQFO-00639 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), dated 10/22/2024, and to your request for a waiver of all assessable FOIA fees.  Our office received your request on 10/22/2024.  Specifically, you requested \r\n\r\n1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. \r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. \r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. \r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although DHS\u2019 goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances under 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  The DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.11(k) set forth six factors DHS must evaluate to determine whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met:  (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government,\u201d (2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities, (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons, (4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \u201csignificant,\u201d (5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, and (6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. \r\n\r\nUpon review of the subject matter of your request, and an evaluation of the six factors identified above, DHS has determined that it will conditionally grant your request for a fee waiver.  The fee waiver determination will be based upon a sampling of the responsive documents received from the various DHS program offices as a result of the searches conducted in response to your FOIA request.  DHS will, pursuant to DHS FOIA regulations applicable to non-commercial requesters, provide two hours of search time and process the first 100 pages at no charge to you.  If upon review of these documents, DHS determines that the disclosure of the information contained in those documents does not meet the factors permitting DHS to waive the fees, then DHS will at that time either deny your request for a fee waiver entirely, or will allow for a percentage reduction in the amount of the fees corresponding to the amount of relevant material found that meets the factors allowing for a fee waiver.  In either case, DHS will promptly notify you of its final decision regarding your request for a fee waiver and provide you with the responsive records as required by applicable law. \r\n\r\nIn the event that your fee waiver is denied, and you determine that you still want the records, provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester you will be charged for any search time and duplication beyond the free two hours and 100 pages mentioned in the previous paragraph.  You will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication and search time at the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  In the event that your fee waiver is denied, we will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.  This office will contact you before accruing any additional fees. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate component(s) of DHS for responsive records.  If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.  Please be assured that one of the analysts in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.  We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-HQFO-00639.  Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743.",

Additionally, there is only one designated individual in this position at DHS. Please confirm that this interpretation is correct by November 26, 2024.\r\n\r\nIn this specific request, 2025-HQFO-00639, the first three (email) records are confined to the primary email address used by the DHS Chief FOIA Officer. It is not confined by 'office', as that's not how email works. It's also not based on the \"FOIA box\" or similar; it's based on the identified officer's email.\r\n\r\nThe fourth record (FTE FOIA employees) in this request is confined to the DHS Office of Privacy.\r\n\r\n> This also means that similar requests sent to other DHS components will be administratively closed, as our office would be the only one with records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\nI do not agree or consent to this. \r\n\r\nFOIA applies to each individual \"agency\", \"whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency\", not only to Departments. 5 USC 552(f)(1), 551(1). See e.g. Energy Research v. Defense Nuclear Facilities, 917 F. 2d 581, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1990) \r\n and Sussman v. US Marshals Service, 808 F. Supp. 2d 192, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\r\n\r\nSimilar requests sent to DHS component agencies refer to that agency's own chief FOIA officer (or equivalent, whatever their formal designation), not to DHS'. The \"expressly limited\" clause is explicit on this, and was written to specifically preclude your proposed interpretation that would have requests which were made specifically to DHS component agencies be ignored. In any case, even if it were ambiguous, I have now clarified my intent, which is binding.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

Information in personnel and medical files, as well as similar personal information in other files, that, if disclosed to a requester, other than the person about whom the information is about, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
