Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nIf your department does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian\u2019s name and address.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Richard Allen was convicted and sentenced October 31st 2024 and the judge assured that after the gag order was lifted at sentencing trial exhibits would be made public as the transcript is being prepared. She has since then instructed her court reporter to advise the public that possibly someday these will be made available. Considering the length of time I am asking for all exhibits used in the trial that were not sealed.  Indiana Public Records Act \"APRA\" Indiana Code 5-14-3 et seq requires these exhibits to be made public. Considering the volumne of these exhibits some delay is understandable. Four months is no longer understandable and the excuses given to the media who have requested them are ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Officers responded to an alarm activation at approximately 3 a.m. and found Morgan inside, taking cigarettes from behind the counter. Upon questioning, he claimed he had entered the store to use the bathroom. Officers recovered multiple partially consumed items from his pockets. During his arrest, Morgan allegedly resisted being placed in a patrol car and spat on an officer. He was charged with burglary, petit theft, resisting an officer without violence, and battery on a law enforcement officer.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nMade initial contact with Morgan inside the Walgreens.\r\nConducted the search and recovered stolen items.\r\nDocumented his statements and resistance to arrest.\r\nTransported Morgan to the police station or jail.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",
