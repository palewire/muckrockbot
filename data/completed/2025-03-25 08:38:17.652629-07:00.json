        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBackground on the CBP One\r\nMost asylum-seekers who come to the U.S. border through Mexico are expelled under the Title 42 Order initiated during the prior administration and continued by the Biden administration. More than 2 million such expulsions have occurred in roughly two years\u2014many of whom are bona fide asylum-seekers who fear serious harm, persecution, and torture in Mexico. Some of the expelled are removed to their origin state by Mexican immigration officials. Others perish in Mexico, or re-attempting the dangerous entry into the U.S. in order to avoid that fate. \r\n\r\nFor some \u2014 roughly 700 per day as an aggregate number encompassing all Southern CBP Ports of Entry \u2014 the U.S. government allows exemption from Title 42 and entry into the U.S., notwithstanding that order. \r\n\r\nA U.S. government-required app called \u201cCBP-One\u201d serves as the hub for making exemption requests. Here is the CBP One Privacy Impact Assessment: https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhscbppia-068-cbp-one-mobile-application \r\n\r\nThrough CBP-One, civil society organizations and Mexican immigration officials (INM) are afforded a dedicated number of exemptions. These parties then identify qualified exemption-seekers and inform CBP that they wish to cross under a Title 42 exemption. Exporting data from the CBP-One app, CBP then sends spreadsheets to INM indicating who will be allowed to present at a POE and claim a Title 42 exemption. Because the exemption process is among the only lawful paths to protection for people fleeing violence, access to exemption numbers from CBP, and the corresponding requirement to use CBP One to claim these exemptions by information CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFO) who\u2019s on the list, has become a coveted, and thus, a commodity. The organizations CBP has unilaterally chosen have monetized access to CBP One, charging rates varying from $2,000 to $6,000 to individuals for the privilege of claiming an exemption. Many other organizations have objected to CBP One\u2019s intrusive surveillance and opted out altogether. \r\n\r\nThis Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeks an answer to a very simple set of easily answerable questions: \r\n1. \u201cHow many people have sought Title 42 exemptions through the CBP One app since its rollout by CBP?\u201d \r\n2.  \u201cHow many people did CBP grant Title 42 exemptions after receiving their information through the CBP One app since its rollout by CBP?\u201d  \r\n3. \u201cHow many civil society organizations has CBP authorized to facilitate Title 42 exemptions using CBP One?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnswers we Do NOT seek to through this FOIA: (a) personally identifiable information (PII) regarding individuals presented as applicants for exemptions through the CBP One app. Who, what, when, or where people crossed is not the subject of this request. \r\n\r\nRather, we simply want to know the total number of people granted Title 42 exemptions through CBP One, and the number of civil society orgs CBP has authorized to facilitate Title 42 exemptions using CBP One? \r\n\r\nDescription of Records Sought:\r\nWe request access to the following agency records from CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations and/or the Migrant Crisis Action Team: \r\n\r\n1. Any record demonstrating the total number of Title 42 exemptions sought through the CBP One app since its inception. (Note: We do not seek cumulative or duplicative records. Any single record evidencing this information will suffice.)\r\n2. Any record demonstrating the total number of Title 42 exemptions granted by CBP after receiving the applicant\u2019s information via the CBP One app. (Note: We do not seek cumulative or duplicative records. Any single record evidencing this information will suffice.)\r\n3. Any record demonstrating the total number of civil society (i.e., not government) who have used the CBP One app to facilitate Title 42 exemptions? \r\n\r\nWe believe the most likely custodians of these records will be CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFO) and/or the Migrant Crisis Action Team (MCAT). We believe these records are most likely stored in an excel spreadsheet containing data exported from CBP One or a related interface. We believe these sheets are, at minimum, stored on a shared drive. We further believe CBP\u2019s Office of Information Technology (OIT) could facilitate a prompt and adequate search for response records. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), we hereby request Expedited Processing of this request, and hereby certify that the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.1746: \r\n1. Humanitarian issues and national policy debates around Title 42 are a matter of widespread media interest about which serious questions exist as to the government\u2019s performance of its duties and legal obligations. So serious, in fact, that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held on November 15, 2022, that Title 42 was arbitrary and capricious when issued. Evidence in the Huisha Huisha case from CDC whistleblowers indicates the public health determinations on which Title 42 are allegedly based originated outside of CDC, and are unsupported by scientific consensus. \r\n\r\n2. December 22, 2022, is reportedly the date on which Title 42 will cease to be in effect. Public reporting in Axios reflects the Biden administration expects a high volume of individuals may return and seek admission and protection under humanitarian laws including the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture. \r\n\r\n3. CBP One has created a massive market for exemption payments in Mexico, with demands from some CBP-chosen organizations ranging from $2000-$6000 per individual seeking exemption through CBP One. With roughly 700 exemptions available per day, this represents a ~$10M-~$30M/week government-created market for entry to the U.S. using the CBP One app. This amounts to as much as $1.5bn in fees paid by migrants in a given year.\r\n\r\n4. This commodification of safety has put individuals and organizations at risk of extortion by cartels in Mexico.\r\n\r\n5. CBP has had actual awareness of these extortion risks to civil society organizations, as applied to CBP One, for at least several weeks prior to the filing of this FOIA request.\r\n\r\n6. Failure to promptly search for and provide responsive records will harm our project\u2019s ability to accurately confirm unofficial assessments of the scope of the CBP One market BEFORE the scheduled end of Title 42, which will be vital to effectively advocating a workable future for the CBP One app. Processing this request in the ordinary course would render the records sought useless for the purposes we seek them because we could still be waiting for records months or even years after the policy change on the ground is set to occur. \r\n\r\nFOIA Information Demands\r\nPursuant to 5 USC 552, on behalf of Al Otro Lado\u2019s #DetentionKills Transparency Project, we demand that CBP: \r\n1. Acknowledge receipt of this request within 10 calendar days. \r\n2. Assign this request an individualized tracking number within 10 calendar days. \r\n3. Adjudicate and respond to the Expedited Processing request within 10 calendar days. \r\n4. Provide a response to this request as soon as practicable, or no later than 30 business days after receiving this request. \r\n5. Provide an estimated date on which the agency intends to release records within 20 calendar days of receiving this request. \r\n6. Task an adequate search reasonably calculated to locate the above requested records, and notify all relevant custodians in writing of their obligations to identify, preserve, and search for responsive records. \r\n7. Make all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of responsive agency records promptly available in native format. (E.g., release an excel spreadsheet in .xls or xlsx) \r\n8. Provide the name of an agency official who made the required determination of foreseeable harm for any record withheld as exempt. \r\n9. Notify us in writing of our right to appeal any denial, regardless whether the denial was in whole or in part. \r\n10. Assign our request a simple-track processing designation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this request. \r\n\r\nAndrew Free \r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

By this letter, we concur with your assessment, and remand your case file to FOIA Division for immediate processing of your request.In your initial request, you sought total number of people granted Title 42 exemptions through CBP One, and the number of civil society orgs CBP has authorized to facilitate Title 42 exemptions using CBP One? As of 06/02/2023, FOIA Division, the office responsible for responding to initial FOIA requests, has not yet responded to your request. In your appeal, you contend that \u201cthe agency has failed to provide a timely response within the statutorily provided guidelines. We concur. The FOIA itself requires that each agency, absent unusual or exceptional circumstances, \u201cdetermine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(6)(A)(i). As CBP\u2019s FOIA Division has not responded to your FOIA request within this statutory timeframe, we agree that the agency is delinquent in responding to your request.However, we find that an administrative appeal is an inappropriate cure in this instance.  Indeed, a requester \u201cshall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i).  Instead, a constructive denial allows a requester to proceed directly to district court if an agency fails to respond to an initial request within the prescribed time period.  This determination is consistent with the language of the FOIA itself and the DHS regulations governing FOIA requests.Under the FOIA\u2019s administrative appeal provision, a requester has the right to administratively appeal any adverse determination that an agency makes on his or her FOIA request.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(6)(A).  Under DHS regulations, adverse determinations include denials of records in full or in part, \u201cno records\u201d responses, denials of requests for fee waivers and denials of requests for expedited processing. See 6 CFR 5.6(c). We note that the definition does not explicitly include a failure to respond.The administrative appeal process is important to agencies and requesters because the appeal process provides an agency with an opportunity to review its initial action taken in response to a request to determine whether corrective steps are necessary.  The appeals process allows CBP to correct mistakes made at lower levels and thereby obviates unnecessary judicial review.  In this case, there is no administrative record to review because FOIA Division has not yet processed the request. Accordingly, we are remanding your request to FOIA Division for processing.  As mentioned above, you may immediately challenge FOIA Division\u2019s failure to respond to your request in district court. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(4)(B), you may do so in the U.S. District Court in the district in which you reside or have a principle place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.Alternatively, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  If you wish to contact OGIS, you may email them at ogis@nara.gov or call 1-877-684-6448.Please note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/cbp-one-mobile-application \nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-FO-2023-018650 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Neiss:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), which we received in our FOIA office via email on February 10, 2025. We have designated your inquiry as FOIA Request # 202500081F. Please include this request number on all correspondence with the FOIA office.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A copy of the complete list of actions taken in response to OPM's January 29, 2025, memo entitled: \"Initial Guidance Regarding President Trump's Executive Order Defending Women\" and the President's Executive Order entitled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A copy of any agency plans to fully comply with OPM's January 29, 2025, memo entitled: \"Initial Guidance Regarding President Trump's Executive Order Defending Women\" and the President's Executive Order entitled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. \"\r\n\r\nWe respond to requests on a first-in, first-out basis and on a multi-track system. Your request has been placed on the complex track. You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to identify specific documents in order to be eligible for the faster track. To do so, please send a written request, identifying the specific documents sought, to Export-Import Bank of the United States, 811 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20571, ATTN: FOIA OFFICER. You may also submit a narrowed request via E-Mail at foia@exim.gov<mailto:foia@exim.gov>. The phrase \"Narrowed Request\" should appear on the letter and on the outside of the envelope containing the narrowed request or in the \"Subject\" line of the E-Mail. Please include the request number listed above on all correspondence with the FOIA office. We will notify you if your request is placed in the simple track.\r\n\r\nEXIM intends to disclose the requested records to the fullest extent of the law. Please be assured that we are processing your request as expeditiously as possible. However, the records you seek require a search in another Office, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii). Because of these unusual circumstances, we need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute. We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request. The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and the volume and complexity of any records located. In an effort to speed up your records search, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative timeframe for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Ms. Lennell Jackson at (202) 565-3290. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please feel free to contact me.

The outage affected our ability to access the system and deleted requests that were already in the system. We estimate we have lost requests submitted since November 2024. As of March 19, 2025, the system is partially available, and we are now able to proceed with accepting new requests and assigning accurate FOIA numbers for any requests received from February 14, 2025, through March 21, 2025. We are working with our vendor\u2019s technical team to resolve any remaining issues and restore any deleted information as soon as possible. Please know we certainly understand the importance of your request and are working diligently to provide the information you have requested, but due to the outage it may take longer for us to provide our response.\r\n\r\nThe status of your request is as follows:\r\n\r\nWe have conducted the initial review and have submitted the documents to our Legal Division for review. Therefore, we estimate we will be able to provide a response within three weeks.

Gen Wins briefed: \"There was an out of house consortium that was created and there are some alumni who recognizing kind of how fast this thing is moving, they went and got involved in this consortium where they are some cadet athletes, basketball players. There's an agreement on them here. Now there's two other features that are separate from the NIL. There's an Academic Achievement Fund, which we did. Okay. And the Academic Achievement Fund is set up in such a way where if you stay at VMI and you perform academically at a certain level, right, then you would get a sum of money and I'm pretty sure academic achievement was upon graduation. There's a second one that's called the Austin Fund which operates similarly. Okay. And I know that that one is upon graduation you would get this the equivalent of I believe $5,000 a year. Right. For four years. So when you graduate in four years, the Austin fund would get you somewhere about $20,000. You have those, those two arrangements as well, which we are participating in right now. It largely affects only basketball. It largely only affects basketball.\" He also briefed that the budget projection is based on increased ticket sales. He also mentioned \"Jamal\" attended a Keydet Club meeting covering the NIL and consortiuum and has the slides and other materials from that. This FOIA requests \r\n\r\n1. Records showing the struture, operations and policies of the NIL consortiuum Maj. Gen. Wins Mentioned. Again, these records include Keydet Club and Alumni Agencies slides, documents, agreements, and other materials given to him that, as a result, become discloseable Public Records.\r\n2. Records showing the amunt paid out of the Academic Achievement Fund since its creation and THE SOURCE OF THOSE FUNDS (student fees, donors (who?), state funds, etc.).\r\n3. Records showing how much, if anything, cadets are charged or any funds form cadet athletic or other student fees for admission to or their attendence at NCAA Football and NCAA basketball events regardless if these are considered \"tickets\" or not for the past 2 academic years.\r\n\r\n#1 and especially #3 should be readily available and should not take more than the 5 day maximum. I am willing to accept any of these immediately available rather than wait for all records if needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Deputy Lane, 27, was found off-duty and asleep at the wheel of his personal vehicle at a gas station around 2 a.m. He was subsequently arrested for DUI and placed on administrative leave without pay pending an Internal Affairs investigation.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from deputies involved in the response and arrest of Deputy Jonathon Michael Lane.\r\nAll available dashboard camera (dashcam) footage from patrol vehicles present at the scene.\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and witness statements.\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports.\r\nAny photographs taken by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, his vehicle, and the scene.\r\nThe full arrest affidavits and any related charging documents filed in this case.\r\nAny internal reviews, use-of-force reports, or investigations conducted by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll bureau files covering investigations into the Minutemen organization in the following cities: Chicago (105-11643), Los Angeles (62-5101), Miami (105-4921), Phoenix (105-1226), and San Diego (100-12461). The Minutemen were a right-wing paramilitary group founded in June 1960 by businessman Robert Bolivar DePugh and operated in some capacity in cities throughout the United States between 1960 and 1969. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has already made public files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and Minutemen operations in cities like New York City, so I am asking the FBI provide copies of files on these additional cities so the public may have a greater understanding of this organization and its place within the social unrest of the sixties.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I have written for Philly Voice and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250.

I am requesting the following:\r\n    \r\n    All bureau files covering investigations into the Minutemen organization in\r\n    the following cities: Chicago (105-11643), Los Angeles (62-5101), Miami\r\n    (105-4921), Phoenix (105-1226), and San Diego (100-12461). The Minutemen\r\n    were a right-wing paramilitary group founded in June 1960 by businessman\r\n    Robert Bolivar DePugh and operated in some capacity in cities throughout the\r\n    United States between 1960 and 1969. The Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\n    (FBI) has already made public files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and Minutemen\r\n    operations in cities like New York City, so I am asking the FBI provide\r\n    copies of files on these additional cities so the public may have a greater\r\n    understanding of this organization and its place within the social unrest of\r\n    the sixties.\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records.\r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees\r\n    associated with this request. I have written for Philly Voice and Atlas\r\n    Obscura.

        "communication": "To FOIA Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information (FOIA) Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following:\r\n\r\nOn November 22, 2022, I submitted Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request number 1510574-000 via MuckRock seeking all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records on the Chicago chapter of paramilitary group the Minutemen. At that time, I included the chapter\u2019s Bureau file number (105-11643) for reference purposes.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2022, I received a response letter from the FBI releasing only one page from the chapter\u2019s Bureau file and rejecting the rest of my request. The rejection letter cited FOIA exemptions (b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1), (b)(6), (b)(7)(c), and (b)(7)(e). I am appealing these exemptions for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(c): Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(c) are written to protect the rights of individuals against a clear and unwarranted \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d with (b)(6) specifically covering personnel and medical files. First, I am not requesting personnel or medical files; I am asking for files from investigations into a right-wing paramilitary group. I believe exemption (b)(6) may have been included in error and request a review of this exemption.\r\n\r\nNext, persons and groups may retain privacy rights under some circumstances, but, per the United States Court of Appeals, District Columbia Circuit, in Fund for Constitutional Government v. National Archives & Records Service, these rights yield \u201cwhere exceptional interests militate in favor of disclosure.\u201d Through actions and public statements made by Minuteman founder Robert Bolivar DePugh, the Minutemen and any subsequent chapters have no expectations of privacy because they are figures of exceptional public interest. Mr. DePugh spoke at length with newspapers about the group and participated in an unofficial biography, published in 1968 under the title \"The Minutemen\" (later re-released in 1969 as \"A Private Army\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the FBI has already released files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and the Minutemen to researcher John Greenwald, Jr. in 2018, as part of FOIPA request number 1415062-000 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). Other files on the New York City chapter were released to researcher Ernie Lazar prior to that (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). These documents are publicly accessible in a variety of formats as of the writing of this appeal; Mr. Greenwald\u2019s can be found on his site, The Black Vault, while Mr. Lazar\u2019s are collected at the Internet Archive. Privacy concerns cannot be re-extended to figures where they have already been waived or determined no longer applicable.\r\n\r\n(b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1) and (b)(7)(e): These exemption cover information that disclose \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d and \u201ctechniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\" However, these would not apply as the group in question, the Minutemen, ceased operations and disbanded in the 1970s. Although individuals may have claimed to revive the group at various points since then, there are no active chapters of the Minutemen at this time. The group\u2019s founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, passed away on June 30, 2009 (attached as \"Minuteman outlasted notoriety...\"). In the absence of a functioning body and the death of Mr. DePugh, the release of these files would not risk circumvention of the law by any living parties.\r\n\r\nMany of the intelligence sources for the FBI have also been disclosed elsewhere. These individuals include: Michael Desmond Sadewhite, who served as a Bureau informant from 1966 until 1967 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"); Henry Edward Warren, who disclosed information on the Minutemen from 1966 to 1968; and Jerry Milton Brooks, who testified against Mr. DePugh in 1966 and later claimed to have worked as an informant for both the FBI and then-Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit. These individuals have all been identified publicly in newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s or in J. Harry Jones\u2019s book \"The Minutemen\".\r\n\r\nAlso, as previously mentioned, documents containing information about Mr. DePugh and the Minutemen have been released in other FOIPA releases in the past. Any concerns over disclosures with regard to intelligence sources or law enforcement investigation techniques or methods would have been voided upon the release of those documents.\r\n\r\nFinally, I am renewing my request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including CovertAction Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the FBI's Information Management Division does in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Seidel, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Information Management Division, inquiring if I would like to continue with FOIPA requests 1510698-000 and 1510700-000, for information on the Minutemen organiation. Please consider this communication confirmation of my intention to continue with these requests. No circumstances have changed on my end, and I am still very much interested in obtaining these records.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to renew my request for a fee waiver. My bylines include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your guidance through the FOIPA process. I greatly appreciate the work the FBI's Information Management Division does in reviewing and releasing all eligible records.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

See Dep\u2019t of Justice Office of Information Policy, President Obama\u2019s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder\u2019s FOIA Guidelines: Creating a \u201cNew Era of Open Government\u201d (2009), available at https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-creating-new-era-open-government). \r\n\r\nRequest for Public Interest Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest. It \u201cis likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the activities or operations of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nFirst, the records concern the operations or activities of the government. Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Specifically, the requested records will reveal substantial new information about how the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau defines and manages public comments. They will allow the public to see what public messages have been rescinded and the process by which these statements were retracted as compared to the processes employed by other agencies.  \r\nFor example, my research on the Twitter account of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base revealed to the public that the account had systematically deleted controversial tweets. See Brady Dale, To What Extent is a Tweet a Federal Record?,  TECHNICAL.LY BROOKLYN (October 24, 2017), (https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2017/10/24/muira-mccammon-talks-gitmo-radical-networks/).\r\n\r\nFinally, the records are not primarily in my own commercial interest. I seek the requested information for newsgathering purposes, and expect to incorporate it into journalistic work product to be disseminated to the public, like those already produced. See Muira Mccammon, Trouble @JTFGTMO, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html; Muira McCammon, Can They Really Delete That?, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I respectfully request that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau grant a public interest fee waiver for this request, and that all fees related to the search, review, and duplication of the requested records be waived. If the fees will not be waived, I agree to pay up to $100 for the processing of this request. If the estimated fees will exceed this limit, please inform me before you begin processing.\r\nRequest for \u201cNews Media\u201d Fee Status \r\n\r\nAs a freelance journalist, I am a representative of the news media and do not seek the records requested for commercial use. Therefore, if the agency does not find that my request meets the standards required for a public interest fee waiver, I request that fees associated with the processing of my request be limited to reasonable duplication costs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).\r\nI am a representative of the news media because I \u201cgather[] information of potential interest to a segment of the public, use[] [my] editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distribute[] that work to an audience.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). I can \u201cdemonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication\u2026 by a\u2026 past publication record.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). \r\n\r\nMy work has been featured in publications including Slate, VICE, the Massachusetts Review, Kill Screen, and more. I have previously requested documents obtained via FOIA from a range of federal agencies and government officials regarding the deletion of tweets from official Twitter accounts. I used that information to write a series of articles outlining both how individual agencies decided whether or not to delete tweets and more broadly how the government regards Twitter statements. These articles have been published, disseminated, and further reported upon to a broad audience. See Muira Mccammon, Trouble @JTFGTMO, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html; Muira Mccammon, Can They Really Delete That?, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html.. \r\nTherefore, if this request is not classified as being in the public interest, I respectfully request to be classified as a \u201cnews media\u201d requester for purposes of fee assessments. \r\n***\r\nI request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format, if possible. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). I further request that you provide an estimated date on which you will finish processing this request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. As per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), I expect your determination on whether to comply with this request within twenty (20) days.

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period.

        "communication": "03/05/2025 \n\nMuira McCammon \nMuckRock News \nMuckRock News, DEPT MR 79386 \n411A Highland Ave \nSomerville, Massachusetts 02144 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2020-ICFO-63387 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 7/9/2020.  You have requested all agency records, from September 7, 2018 to August 25, 2019, concerning public comments submitted to ICE related to the proposed rule, \u201cApprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of Alien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children\u201d (see request for details). ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO), ICE Office of Regulatory Affairs and Policy (ORAP) and ICE Office of Management and Administrative Services for records responsive to your request produced 57 pages and 1 Excel Spreadsheet that are responsive to your request.  Portions of 57 pages and 1 Excel Spreadsheet will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

Bloodworth, 24, crashed her Tesla on her father\u2019s private island while allegedly driving under the influence. Responding Monroe County deputies encountered her inside the wrecked vehicle, where she initially refused to exit, claiming, \u201cMy father owns this island!\u201d Upon being removed, she resisted arrest, kicked and screamed, and was recorded on bodycam crying, \u201cI need my dad here!\u201d Deputies later used an airboat to recover evidence, including open vodka bottles. She was arrested and charged with DUI, resisting arrest, and fleeing law enforcement.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from all deputies involved in the response, arrest, and transportation of Stephanie Bloodworth, specifically between 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM\r\nAll available dashboard camera dashcam footage from all responding patrol vehicles present at the scene\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and CAD reports\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and use-of-force documentation\r\nThe full DUI report, blood alcohol test results, and any toxicology findings associated with this case\r\nAll booking documents, jail intake records, and any recorded statements made by Stephanie Bloodworth following her arrest\r\nAll photographs taken by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office MCSO during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, the crashed Tesla, the crash site, and recovered evidence such as open vodka bottles\r\nAny video footage from airboat operations or any surveillance footage that may have captured the crash, response, or evidence recovery\r\nAny internal reviews or reports related to this incident, including documents regarding the use of an airboat for evidence retrieval\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Monroe County Sheriff\u2019s Office regarding this incident\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from the dissemination of these materials, the request primarily serves to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We do not any photographs, full DUI report, images of the crashed Tesla, the crashed site, and evidence of the open vodka bottles. It will take .5 hours to do the radio transmissions.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format.

When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS \r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated. \r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints. \r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nGood Luck Request Status: Pending \r\nYour request listed above requires\u00a0additional time to process. You will be contacted within 30 days about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question. Thank you for your patience. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSOUTH SOUND 911 \r\nThis is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account. Please DO NOT REPLY.",

Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nGood Luck Request Status: Pending \r\nYour request listed above requires\u00a0additional time to process. You will be contacted within 30 days about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question. Thank you for your patience. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSOUTH SOUND 911 \r\nThis is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account. Please DO NOT REPLY.",

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS \r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated. \r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints. \r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nGood Luck \r\nPlease log in to the Records Center here\u00a0to retrieve the appropriate response. The documents are also attached to this email as a courtesy.

South Sound 911 does not track costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection. The Public Records Act one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has started to run because the agency does not intend to further address the request. We have made every attempt to weed out duplicates or blank pages; however, sometimes these issues do occur. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions about this request, please contact South Sound 911\u2019s Public Records Officer in writing within 14 days. Please include your name, request reference number and contact information. \r\n\r\nPlease mail or deliver your letter to: \r\nTina Klein \r\nPublic Records Officer \r\nSouth Sound 911 \r\n3580 Pacific Avenue \r\nTacoma, WA 98418 \r\nSincerely, \r\nDisclosure Unit \r\nSouth Sound 911",

As such, the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and I look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\n-Daniel Boguslaw",
