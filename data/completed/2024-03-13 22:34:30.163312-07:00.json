        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The information you are requesting can be found on our City\r\nwebsite, listed under Flock Camera Transparency Portal.  If there is any\r\nother information you need, please feel free to contact us.  *\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.carmel.ca.us/police-fire\r\n\r\n*We apologize for the delay in this response as the amount of information\r\nrequested was excessive and we were in the process of adding it all to the\r\nportal for the public to view.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*PRA rec'd 2-16-2024 from Muckrock:*\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers\r\n(\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares\r\nALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives\r\nALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares\r\n\u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives\r\n\u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for\r\nextraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant\r\nSolutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the\r\nData Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is\r\navailable through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as\r\nBOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this\r\ninformation (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has\r\ninterpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does\r\nnot exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be\r\nexported through software your agency has already purchased, and is\r\ntherefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following\r\nrecords:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are\r\nalso often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a\r\nCalifornia law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods\r\nJanuary 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information\r\nrequested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and\r\nwould require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and\r\n\u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the\r\ndate this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period\r\nshorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on\r\nyour retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have\r\nthis data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this\r\nrequest is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1\r\nyear, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the\r\nALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola\r\nSolutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report\r\nfunction. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the\r\ntransparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar\r\nfunctionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system\r\nand can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California\r\nPublic Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in\r\nwhich the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public\r\nunderstand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is\r\ncollected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying\r\naccess to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have\r\nprovided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous\r\nyears. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of\r\nthe agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n\r\nPAUL TOMASI\r\n\nChief of Police\r\n\r\nDirector of Public Safety\r\n\r\nCarmel-by-the-Sea Police Department\r\n\r\nP.O.

The NPRC will assign your request a new tracking number, and\r\nrespond to you directly.  NPRC does not use the FOIAonline website portal,\r\nfor this reason your request has been removed from that system where it no\r\nlonger exists.

You requested, \"the signed agreement between the VA and the NAACP.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReasonable Search Dated 3/5/24 & 3/6/24\r\nOn March 5, 2024, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through the VA Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solutions (VIEWS), VA's official System of Record for partnership agreements, for responsive records.  An OSVA FOIA Officer used the search term \"NAACP.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2024, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA Center for Minority Veterans search for and provided all responsive records in its possession. These two (2) searches yielded seven (7) responsive pages.\r\n\r\nNews Media Fee Category\r\nWe have placed you in the news media category.  For this FOIA request, OSVA does not charge any FOIA fees.  OSVA reserves the right to charge FOIA fees for any future FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nInitial Agency Decision\r\nOSVA releases seven (7) pages redacted with FOIA Exemption 6.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) exempts from required disclosure \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"  The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"similar files\" broadly, to include all information that \"applies to a particular individual.\" U.S. Dep't of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982).   FOIA Exemption 6 permits VA to withhold a document or information within a document if disclosure of the information, either by itself or in conjunction with other information available to either the public or the FOIA requester, would result in an unwarranted invasion of an individual's personal privacy without contributing significantly to the public's understanding of the activities of the federal government.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the information being withheld, as indicated on the attached document, under FOIA Exemption 6, consists of the personal signatures of federal employees and partners.  VA releases the names of Senior Executives and federal partners.  Federal employees and partners retain a significant privacy interest under certain circumstances, such as in instances where the release of their information could represent a threat to their well-being, harassment, or their ability to function within their sphere of employment.  The federal employee and partners whose information is at issue have a substantial privacy interest in their personal information.  In weighing the private versus the public interest, we find that there is no public interest in the personal signatures of federal employees and partners.  The coverage of FOIA Exemption 6 is absolute unless the FOIA requester can demonstrate a countervailing public interest in the requested information by demonstrating that the FOIA requester is in a position to provide the requested information to members of the general public and that the information requested contributes significantly to the public's understanding of the activities of the Federal government.  Additionally, the requester must demonstrate how the public's need to understand the information significantly outweighs the privacy interest of the person to whom the information pertains.  Upon consideration of the records, I have not been able to identify a countervailing public interest of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals whose names are redacted.  The protected information has been redacted and (b)(6) inserted.  \"Withholding a telephone number or e-mail address, alone, is not sufficient to protect that [privacy] interest; alternate means of contacting and harassing these employees would be readily discoverable on the Internet if this court ordered their names disclosed.\"  Long v. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160719 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIA Mediation\r\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.

The Office of the Secretary of State Elections Division maintains election results for races that occur at the district-level or higher; you would need to reach out to the locality or county for the results of a local races.  You can do so by visiting the county election website available at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/links.shtml#County>, or by reaching out to your County Elections Official at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/county.shtml>, or your city officials here<https://directory.tml.org/>.\r\n\r\nElection results maintained by the Office of the Secretary of State can be found on our Historical Election Results page for the years 1992 to 2019 at this link<https://elections.sos.state.tx.us/index.htm> and on our Election Night Results page for 2019 going forward at this link<https://results.texas-election.com/landing-page>.  After the completion of the statewide canvass, these results will become available for download under the \u201cReports\u201d tab in PDF or Excel format.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding voter turnout and registration statistics is available on our Election Results page at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/historical/index.shtml>.  Another potential resource for obtaining archival elections and voting information is the Texas Almanac, available at this link<https://www.texasalmanac.com/articles/elections-of-texas-governors-1845-2010>.\r\n\r\nFinally, the individual Texas counties are the custodians of their historical election results and voter registration records.  For historical election data potentially maintained at a more local level, you might reach out to the individual Texas counties using the contact information at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/current.shtml>.\r\n\r\nShould you need any additional information or have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to send us an email at Elections@sos.texas.gov<mailto:Elections@sos.texas.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKate Fisher\r\nElections Division\r\nOffice of the Texas Secretary of State\r\n1019 Brazos Street | Rudder Building, 2nd Floor | Austin, Texas 78701\n",

Specifically, I need the following information to be included in the data.\r\n\r\n1. Text of the ballot initiative/referendum\r\n2. Local government where the election took place.\r\n3. County where the local government is located\r\n4. Election date\r\n5. Result of election (votes for, votes against, pass/fail)\r\n6. Threshold to pass (50%, two-thirds, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have located a potential data source from your state at the following link: https://electionstats.state.ma.us/ballot_questions/search/year_from:1972/year_to:2022/type:is_local\r\nHowever, the data at this link does not contain information on the election date or threshold above. In addition, it contains only information on elections after 2002, while I request data for elections since 1972.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimin Han",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the Elections Division for response.\r\n\r\nAs you note in your request, ballot question data can be found at www.electionstats.state.ma.us<http://www.electionstats.state.ma.us>. This database includes all results certified by this office for candidates and questions which appeared on state ballots.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of local ballot questions appear on local election ballots. Those local elections are administered by local election officials and the results are not submitted to or certified by this office. As such, this office does not have local election results for those questions which did not appear on the state election ballot.\r\n\r\nCities and towns may choose to add specific types of local ballot questions to the state election ballot, if the law allows for it. In general, the two most common types of ballot questions included on the state ballot are so-called \u201cProposition 2 \u00bd\u201d questions and Community Preservation Act questions, as those laws specifically allow for the questions to appear on the state ballot. These laws are relatively new, and such questions were not included on ballots until the 1980s, for Prop 2 \u00bd, and the early 2000s, for CPA questions.\r\n\r\nAttached is a spreadsheet of all ballot questions currently in our election results database. Again, it must be noted that this will not include any local question which appeared on a local election ballot.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that county name is the attached file, because counties are not relevant to election administration or local government in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDebra O\u2019Malley\r\nElections Division\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth\r\n(617) 727-2828\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Public Records within 90 days or seek judicial review by commencing a civil action in superior court. G.L. c. 66 \u00a710(A); 950 CMR 32.08(1).\n",

EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

        "communication": "Jimin Han\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDept MR 159880\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\nVia US Mail and email: 159880-74851862@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:159880-74851862@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\nDear Jimin Han:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State's Office has received your Right-to-Know law request, dated March 6, 2024, for:\r\n\"I am requesting data on local ballot initiatives/referenda that took place in the state since 1972. Specifically, I need the following information to be included in the data.\r\n1. Text of the ballot initiative/referendum\r\n2. Local government where the election took place.\r\n3. County where the local government is located\r\n4. Election date\r\n5. Result of election (votes for, votes against, pass/fail)\r\n6. Threshold to pass (50%, two-thirds, etc)\"\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire voters vote locally at city, town, school district, and village district elections and meetings. Depending on the form of government selected locally, voters may vote on questions by official paper ballot or at a business meeting, where votes may be verbal, raised hands, or unofficial yes-no ballot. In cities and some towns an elected body is the legislative body that votes on these questions. Some local charters, in such towns and cities, however, have certain questions placed on an official ballot voted directly by the voters.\r\n\r\nEach town and city maintains their own records on the questions, in most cases called warrant articles, presented to voters and the outcome of the votes on those questions.\r\n\r\nInformation is most readily available by reviewing the town report produced each year by each town which typically contains the warrant (list of offices and questions to be voted at the upcoming election) and the minutes of the prior years election/meeting documenting the results of the prior election. Contact each city clerk's office to determine the availability of City Council/Board of Mayor and Alderman meeting minutes and reports on the outcome of city elections.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State's office does not possess the records of votes in towns and cities on local initiative/referendum that you have requested.\r\n\r\nThe New Hampshire State library in collaboration with the University of New Hampshire, maintains an online archive of town annual reports which can be viewed here:\r\nhttps://scholars.unh.edu/nh_town_reports/\r\n\r\nMuch less frequently voters vote on local ballot referenda on the state general election ballot. Most are local option votes, such as changing local polling hours at state elections, opting in or out of liquor or lottery sales etc. Voters also vote on statewide questions, such as whether to adopt a proposed amendment to the state constitution.\r\n\r\nEvery two years the Secretary of State's office publishes the N.H. Manual for the General Court that includes information on the results of the most recent state election, including the outcome of such referenda votes. The University of New Hampshire publishes an on-line archive of these documents here:\r\n\r\nInternet Archive: Digital Library of Free & Borrowable Books, Movies, Music & Wayback Machine\r\nhttps://archive.org/search?query=new%20hampshire%20manual%20for%20the%20general%20court\r\n\r\nThe 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023 editions have not been scanned and posted yet on this site. The Secretary of State's office is sending those four books to you by US Mail to the address you provided.\r\n\r\nWhen requested public records are available to the public on-line, providing the requesting party with the URL to access those records satisfies the Right-to-Know law.\r\n\r\nTo the extent you seek town or city records which are not available in these on-line archives, contact information for each town and city clerk is available here:\r\nhttps://app.sos.nh.gov/clerkinformation\r\n\r\nThe default threshold to pass a question is a simple majority, however, in some cases the law requires a supermajority. The records described above will often list the requirements when the law requires a supermajority. Otherwise, the statutes addressing the subject matter will typically contain a statement of supermajority requirements. New Hampshire's laws are available on-line here:\r\nhttps://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/nhtoc.htm\r\n\r\nThe New Hampshire Secretary of State's office does not maintain the information you requested in the form that California uses and publishes on their website.\r\n\r\nThis response and the records we are sending to you by US Mail fulfill your Right-to-Know request. This completes the Secretary of State's Office response to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA748E.BDA20160]\r\nOrville B. \"Bud\" Fitch II\r\nGeneral Counsel, Assistant Secretary of State\r\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State\r\nState House Room 204\r\n107 N.

We note that the requests are limited only to records in our custody and control.\r\nThe Alameda County Sheriff's Office is in the process of searching for responsive, non-exempt data regarding your request.  After review, we will have a cost estimate for you (if any), and upon receipt of payment from you (if any), we will produce these materials.  If deemed necessary, we may have to produce on a rolling basis. We estimate the search to be complete within three weeks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your requests, ACSO asserts that certain documents requested may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Government Code Sections 7927.500, 7927.200, 7927.700, 7923.600-7923.625, 7927.705, 7922.000, 7922.540(a) and possibly additional subsections, and Government Code Sections. ACSO also asserts, certain documents; potentially responsive to your requests, may be shielded by the attorney work product doctrine and the attorney client privilege. Further, some documents may contain confidential information that is protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additional privileges may apply based on a review of the records.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9EBE9.D37B49C0]\r\nCynthia Wilson | Sheriff's Technician #235\r\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\nInternal Affairs | 3 Park Pl., 3rd Floor, Dublin, CA 94568",

However, the names of attachments are redacted in the emails (with the exception of agency logos), making it impossible to link which attachments that were produced go with which emails. Nor does the redaction of attachment names in emails correspond to the exceptions cited for redaction in your response (Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7\u00a77927.500 and 7927.705), which address state law prohibitions and draft documents. In any case, the redaction of attachment names is inconsistent with the disclosure of the attachments themselves. \r\n\r\nPlease re-review the emails that were produced and reverse the redaction of attachment names.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Your request was received by the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, Central Procurement Services, on March 8, 2024.  You have requested:\r\n\r\nI am seeking any agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets showing the names of the state and local law enforcement agencies that have bought or can use services through the following Personal Information Database contracts: LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Contract #: 200000000664 and West Publishing Corporation, a Thomson Reuters business, Contract #: 200000000689.\r\n\r\nThe following action has been taken in response to this request:\r\n\r\nREQUEST GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST PARTIALLY GRANTED:\r\n\r\nWe have identified records believed to be responsive to your request.

The requested records are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(5) of the FOIA, MCL 15.234(5), provides that a public body must notify the requester in writing if all or a part of the requested information is available on the public body's website.

        "communication": "I am writing in response to your request for additional specificity regarding my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request concerning the Essential Worker Criteria and Federal Collaboration for the Erie County Driving Ban.\r\n\r\nMy request clearly identifies the subject matter, includes specific search terms, provides a defined time frame, and suggests departments and officials likely to hold relevant information. This level of detail aligns with the standards set by New York case law for a \u201creasonably described\u201d request:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tClarity of Subject Matter: As per \u201cMatter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine\u201d (9 N.Y.3d 454), my request sufficiently identifies the records sought by focusing on the Essential Worker Criteria and Federal Collaboration for the Erie County Driving Ban.\r\n\t2.\tScope of Search Terms: The specific terms used in my request, such as \u201cEssential Worker Criteria,\u201d \u201cFederal Collaboration,\u201d and \u201cDriving Ban,\u201d meet the standard of a reasonably described request outlined in \u201cM. Farbman & Sons, Inc. v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp.\u201d (62 N.Y.2d 75).\r\n\t3.\tTime Frame: The defined time period in my request is critical for narrowing down the search, in line with \u201cKonigsberg v. Coughlin\u201d (110 A.D.2d 1026).\r\n\t4.\tIdentification of Potential Record Holders: While individual email accounts are not specified, the suggested departments and officials are likely to hold relevant information, meeting the principle established in \u201cMatter of Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Burns\u201d (67 N.Y.2d 562).\r\n\t5.\tNature of Requested Information: The request seeks specific types of records related to a well-defined topic, as supported by \u201cMatter of Gould v. New York City Police Dept.\u201d (89 N.Y.2d 267).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of the above analysis, I respectfully request that your office commit to a diligent search for the requested records based on the criteria provided. The nature of this request, its public interest, and its alignment with FOIL guidelines necessitate a thorough and expedited response.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any denial or failure to comply with this request will be subject to appeal. As established in New York case law, the right to appeal is an essential component of FOIL, ensuring transparency and accountability in government operations.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt and comprehensive response.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript: Regarding the Adequacy of Search Based on Personal Recollection\r\n\r\nI wish to address a critical point regarding the search for the requested records. The responses received thus far have indicated a reliance on personal knowledge or recollection of the existence of documents. It is important to clarify that the adequacy of a FOIL search cannot be solely based on an individual\u2019s memory or lack thereof.\r\n\r\nAs established in the case of \u201cKey v. Hynes\u201d (205 A.D.2d 779), the mere assertion that an individual does not recall specific documents or that they are unaware of their existence does not fulfill the obligation to conduct a diligent search under FOIL. The court in this case emphasized that an agency must make a genuine effort to search for records using the parameters provided by the requester.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in \u201cNew York Civil Liberties Union v. City of Saratoga Springs\u201d (87 A.D.3d 336), the court held that an agency\u2019s obligation under FOIL is to conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. This means that the search should not be limited to the personal knowledge of a single individual but should extend to a systematic review of the agency\u2019s records.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I respectfully request that the search for records responsive to my FOIL request be conducted in a manner that goes beyond individual recollection and involves a comprehensive review of relevant files, databases, and communication channels within the agency and its departments.\r\n\r\nI trust that this clarification will guide the search process and lead to a more thorough and compliant response under the New York State Freedom of Information Law.\r\n",

I understand the challenges you\u2019ve outlined regarding the search for emails without specific email addresses and the absence of departmental search capabilities.\r\n\r\nTo assist in narrowing down the search and making it less time-consuming, I offer the following additional information and clarification:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tDate Range: As specified in my previous communication, the relevant date range for the search is from June 14, 2022, to the present. This period is critical as it encompasses the development and implementation phases of the essential service portal as discussed in public statements.\r\n\t2.\tSearch Terms: I appreciate the need for specific search terms to facilitate the query. In addition to the terms previously provided, consider including variations and abbreviations that may have been used in communications, such as \u201cEW criteria,\u201d \u201cfederal collab,\u201d \u201cdriving ban portal,\u201d and \u201cessential personnel.\u201d\r\n\t3.\tPotential Sources: While I understand the limitation of not being able to search by department, I suggest focusing on individuals known to be involved in emergency management and response initiatives within Erie County. This includes, but is not limited to, officials within the Office of the County Executive and the Department of Emergency Services. Public statements and articles have mentioned Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz in relation to the portal\u2019s development; communications involving his office may be a fruitful starting point.\r\n\t4.\tLGS-01 Obligations: It\u2019s pertinent to note that under the Local Government Schedule (LGS-01), Erie County has obligations to retain, archive, and make accessible records related to government operations and decisions. This includes initiatives such as the essential worker portal, which is of significant public interest.\r\n\t5.\tCommitment to a Diligent Search: I respectfully request a commitment to a diligent search based on the clarified criteria provided. The public interest in understanding the criteria for essential workers during driving bans and the collaboration with federal entities underscores the importance of this request.\r\n\r\nI understand the complexities involved in processing FOIL requests and appreciate your efforts to comply with the law. Please consider this letter as an attempt to work collaboratively towards fulfilling the request in a manner that respects both the spirit and letter of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and am available for any further clarification or assistance that may facilitate the processing of this request.\r\n",

        "communication": "I am writing in regard to your FOIA request received by the Illinois Department of Transportation.  As written, responding to your request would create an undue burden on the operation and resources of the Department.  The Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1, states, in part the \"Act is not intended ... to disrupt the duly-undertaken work of any public body...\" and that requests \"calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information.  Before invoking this exemption, the public body shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions.\" 5 ILCS 140/3(g).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I am inviting you to limit the scope of your request to manageable proportions. Specifically, there are nearly 1500 pages of permitting records for the year 2023.  Previewing and redacting this many files creates a burden on the FOIA Office.  Please limit the scope of your request to a specific location or a shorter timeframe to search.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we receive your response, we will conduct a new search and respond with any relevant requested information.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarb Smith\r\nIllinois Department of Transportation\r\nFOIA Officer, Room 313\r\n2300 S.
