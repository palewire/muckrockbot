Johnson Space Center (JSC), between the years 2015 and 2017, during which time Mr. Johnson reportedly filmed portions of his film \"Operation Avalanche\" (2016) inside of JSC, claiming he was making a documentary. Since it stands to reason that, even if he lied his way into the facility by claiming to be making a documentary, he would still have to obtain some sort of permission in order to film in restricted locations. Therefore, I additionally request any documentation produced as a result of Mr. Johnson's visit to JSC to film scenes for \"Operation Avalanche.\"\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to the Special Targets for Informant Development (SPECTAR) program, aka the Special Target Informant Development program. SPECTAR is identified in former FBI agent Cril Payne\u2019s 1979 memoir \"Deep Cover: An FBI Agent Infiltrates the Radical Underground\" as an operation overseen by the bureau\u2019s Domestic Intelligence Division. Mr. Payne states that as part of the program, he was assigned an informant number LA 7852-S (Extremist), and asked to work in an undercover capacity to infiltrate the Weather Underground, an organization identified by the bureau as a domestic terrorist group made up of members of the New Left.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne\u2019s FBI file was released by the bureau as part of Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request 1581024-000, and contained therein, Mr. Payne references SPECTAR in a letter dated December 17, 1977, which identifies four separate FOIPA requests sent by Mr. Payne to the bureau. Mr. Payne writes: \r\n\r\n\u201cBy letter dated August 25, 1977, you acknowledged receipt of my requests and advised that a notarized affidavit of signature would be required before documents pertaining to me would be released.  You further advised that requests for personal records had been assigned 51,331, the SPECTAR request number 51,340, and and my \u2018final request\u2019 number 51,330.\u201d\r\n\r\nSPECTAR also appears in records related to the FBI\u2019s Domestic Intelligence Division released to researcher Ernie Lazar and now publicly accessible via the Internet Archive, in files labeled \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 4\u201d, \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 5\u201d, and \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 6\u201d. SPECTAR is referenced in a bureau report in \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 4\u201d:\r\n\r\n\u201cBy airtel dated 7/12/72 captioned \u2018Revolutionary Activities - Violence\u2019 a program was initiated to focus on Special Targets for Informant Development (SPECTAR Program). This informant program has as its aim the development of informants who have the capability of penetrating the revolutionary underground, which has been notable for its security consciousness. We have instructed appropriate field offices to assign manpower to SPECTAR and to reduce case load to the degree that these Agents can concentrate on SPECTAR and still maintain close association with developments in pertinent investigations.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor reference, mentions of SPECTAR can be found in the following report: https://archive.org/details/foia_FBI_Domestic_Intelligence_Division-HQ-4/page/n13/mode/1up\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Payne has published written material naming the SPECTAR program, and the bureau acknowledged the existence of such a program in its own internal documents, it is clear the bureau generated records in the course of operations of this program. Therefore, I am asking the bureau to release all records pertaining to SPECTAR.\r\n\r\nRelease of this information is in the public interest because it is related to surveillance operations targeting Americans. Although the bureau classified the Weather Underground Organization as a terrorist group, there is an ongoing dialogue in academia as to whether or not it was a legitimate protest group and how much of its violence was centrally-directed. Arthur Eckstein\u2019s 2016 non-fiction book \u201cBad Moon Rising: How the Weather Underground Beat the FBI and Lost the Revolution\u201d, for example, suggests that despite members of the group downplaying their acts of domestic terrorism once arrested, the bureau may have  had some role in encouraging violent acts.\r\n\r\nSPECTAR is relevant to this discussion because according to Mr. Payne in \u201cDeep Cover\u201d (chapter 8, pages 141 and 142):\r\n\r\n\u201cThe changes in Bureau procedures were not confined solely to the new undercover program. With the approval of Acting Director Pay Gray, a companion program was formulated by the Domestic Intelligence Division under the code name of SPECTAR. The Special Target Informant Development Program (SPECTAR) was designed to improve the efficiency of the deep cover agent and to provide more immediate avenues of penetrating Weathermen support groups. Repeated efforts by the Bureau to develop reliable informants among close friends and associates of the Weathermen fugitives had proved fruitless. It was reasoned that this failure was due in large part to the traditional method of payment for Bureau informants.\u201d \r\n\r\nThus, any records the bureau might have on SPECTAR would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government.\r\n\r\nTied to that, I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the DC Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear Sirs:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, on behalf of Targeted Justice Inc. I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to Targeted Justice, Inc.:\r\n1) All the reports by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on Applications for Delayed-Notice Search Warrants and Extensions drafted and/or published pursuant to the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, documenting the number of applications for warrants and extensions of warrants authorizing delayed notice granted or denied during the each  fiscal year since 2005.\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing Targeted Justice currently has over 15,000 subscribers in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that the request does not respond to any \u201ccommercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject. If you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\nSincerely\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\r\nfor\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O.

This is now the second request to the town, please reference the attached police records request invoice (Paid on Receipt).\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive conversation with Mr. King Wekenmann from IS (The Town of Jupiter's IT Department) on 5/28/2024 at 1:50pm, He explained that the desk phone service from this request during my time frame of 1/6/2024/-1/16/2024 were provided by AT&T, the records in the custody of AT&T during that time period are public records. As for Cell Phones, police department employees either used AT&T FirstNet or used personal cellphones that would be subsidized by the Town. So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, it is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or an unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone and/or the carrier. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (i.e. call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any fees associated pertaining to this request, I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment and/or download link as per Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",

This request includes but is not limited to the initial report, detective case findings and notes, list of suspects, interview notes, leads followed, tips reported and investigated as well as results to possible DNA test requests made in relation to found human remains (as reported in local news outlets in recent years). \r\n\r\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department's website section on missing persons states the associated LMPD report number being 80-05-001813 with NamUs Case number MP6161 and NCMEC case number 1007015. \r\n\r\nAmy's unsolved disappearance is quickly approaching the 20th year anniversary mark. I understand due to the age of this case some files may not be easily accessible. \r\n\r\nI expect this request to be filled in an accessible format, including screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf and image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news/media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Jaspal Singh, age 57, who died on April 15, 2024, at the GEO-owned Folkston ICE Processing Center in Folkston, Georgia. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between April 15, 2024, and May 28, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Jaspal Singh died in ICE custody on April 15, 2024. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/indian-national-ice-custody-dies-hospital\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Charles Leo Daniel who died March 7, 2024, and before that, in the cases Frankline Okpu and Salvador Vargas, to name just a few.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Singh is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. ICE has engaged a pattern and practice of violating its own policy and Congressional appropriations requirements by failing to post death reports within the 30-day period following detainee deaths.\r\n7. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Folkston facility.\r\n8. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Singh's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Singh's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Folkston facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

They did not necessarily occur in a school and may have occurred outside of a school. The spreadsheet details where a report was submitted by an officer and there was no OFFENDER listed.  The age listed was extracted from the database on the incident date. The CAD Incident type was added to give a sense of the activity involved.
