Appeal-  Huminski v. State, 2d19-1914, Florida 2 DCA, author: Chelsea N. Simms, esq, Ashley Moody, esq.   See below,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law please supply;\r\n\r\n    1. The document authored by your office or any other State prosecutorial authority (executive branch official) commencing the case State of Florida v. Huminski, 17-mm-815, Lee County \r\n         Court including the criminal information, indictment or any other document used to commence the case and secure standing by the State as a plaintiff,\r\n\r\n    2. The proof of service of the document in Para. 1 that was effectuated by a State of Florida prosecutorial authority (not a show cause order served by the judicial branch in a civil matter),\r\n\r\n    3. Any document related to the prosecution that contains a criminal statute that supports a criminal prosecution by the sovereign (not F.S. 900.04 which simply governs the conduct of a \r\n         judge to exercise contempt powers).\r\n\r\n    4. In the absence of any of the above documents, please supply any document, recording, emails, letters, invoices, financial records, medical records, employment files, police reports, \r\n         photographs, text messages, and any other relevant documents/materials concerning the initiation of State v.

Absent any valid document production concerning Paras. 1, 2, 3, it is likely that \r\n          crimes were committed by various persons working at the Lee Court complex to accomplish the docketing of the case in Lee County Court including clerks, judicial assistants and \r\n           others.  Judge James Adams, the presiding County Court judge in State v. Huminski was admonished for case hijacking other cases. YORLAN ESPINOSA PENA v. STATE OF FLORIDA, 17- \r\n           4465 (Fla. Dist.

Trial courts \u201clack jurisdiction\u201d until proper pleadings are filed. Lovett v. Lovett, 112 So. 768, 776 (Fla. 1927) accord Lewis v. Lewis, 78 So.2d 711, 712. A trial court's lack of subject-matter\r\njurisdiction makes its judgment void. NWT v. LHD (In re DNHW), 955 So.2d 1236, 1238 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007). A judgment of conviction that is entered against a defendant without service of a charging instrument is absent personal jurisdiction over the defendant and is regarded as a\r\nvoid judgment. Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Bevis, 652 So.2d 382, 383 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995).\r\n\r\nThe Florida Supreme Court has explained that \"jurisdiction to try an accused does not exist under article I, section 15 of the Florida Constitution unless there is an extant information, indictment, or presentment filed by the state.\" State v. Anderson, 537 So.2d 1373, 1374 (Fla.1989).\r\nSee, e.g., Ex parte Reed,101 Fla. 800, 135 So. 302, 303 (1931) (concluding that judgment of conviction by circuit court was void where indictment failed to show that the defendant was charged with a felony). Pope v. State, 268 So.2d 173, 175 (Fla. 2d DCA 1972) (explaining that an allegation of a felony \"is essential to the invocation of the jurisdiction of a felony court over the charge since the allegata of the accusatory writ are precisely the basis in the first instance upon which the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof is predicated\") \r\n\r\nA judgment entered without due service of process is void. See Gelkop v. Gelkop, 384 So.2d 195 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980); McAlice v. Kirsch, 368 So.2d 401 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979); Grahn v. Dade Home Services, Inc. 277 So.2d 544 (Fla. 3d DCA 1973). On motion, a court may, at any time, relieve a party from a void final judgment of conviction. See Sams Food Store, Inc. v. Alvarez, 443 So.2d 211 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983); Tucker v. Dianne Electric, Inc. 389 So.2d 683 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980); McAlice. See also Ramagli Realty Co. v. Craver, 121 So.2d 648 (Fla. 1960) (the passage of time cannot make valid that which has been void).\r\n  \r\nThe hearing of contempt is private to the allegedly offended court. See generally, South Dade Farms v. Peters , 88 So. 2D 891 (Florida Supreme Court 1956) ( approvingly citing \"There has been general recognition of the fact that the courts are clothed with this power, and must be authorized to exercise it without referring the issues of fact or law to another tribunal or to a jury in the same tribunal. \u2026 Bessette v. W.B. Conkey Co., 194 U.S. 324 337, 24 S.Ct. 665, 48 L.Ed. [997] 1005.\") and Huminski v. State, 2d19-1247 (Fl 2nd DCA, 2019)(adding emphasis to the statutory language \u201cagainst it\u201d concerning F.S. \u00a7 38.22).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In order to receive the materials, you will have to pay for them.\r\n\r\n  1.  There are approximately 5,070 pages of records.  I estimate it will take approximately 200 hours to review and redact for exempted materials pursuant to Florida Statute 119 and Marsy\u2019s Law. ($25.00 an hour=$5,000.00).\r\n  2.  I will need to put everything on discs for you.  I am estimating 1 disc.  ($3.00 per disc = $3.00).\r\nThe individual totals are listed above.  Please do not send any money at this time as this is just an estimate. Once you confirm by return email that you will pay, production will proceed.   After completion of the work, an invoice will be sent to you for the actual costs.  Payment can only be in the forms of cash, check or money order and must be the exact amount.  Please note this process may take up to 16 weeks.   Thank you.\nJody Brown\r\nAssistant State Attorney\r\n239-533-1228",

        "communication": "This Sunshine request has been limited to documents authored and filed by subordinates of Amira Dajani Fox in 17-mm-815 in the month of June, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Fl Attorney General needed no such astronomical anticipated payment for handling this request.  See their quite prompt and professional response here,\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/florida-34/amira-fox-20th-circuit-states-attorney-criminal-information-state-v-huminski-17-mm-815-office-of-the-attorney-general-florida-178818/#file-1250623\r\n\r\nEvading accountability is not appropriate conduct for the highest law enforcement official in the 20th Circuit.\r\n\r\nI need only one or two pages containing the papers that your office authored and served to initiate the the docketing and commencement of a criminal prosecution in 17-mm-815.    Arraignment was held on 6/29/2017 and 17-mm-815 was docketed on 6/30/2017.  If any document exists,  it would have been authored in June 2017.  Cases don't get docketed without a pleading from the plaintiff filed in court (see case law filed previously in this Sunshine request).  This request is narrowed to only June 2017.  See case law authority filed in this request that governs case initiation and jurisdiction mandating the existence of pleadings by a plaintiff necessary for subject-matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe full record on appeal is available to the public as listed in the links above.  Only June 2017 documents are sought in this request.  Please read the request and only consider producing the requested 1, 2 or 3 pages of documents that don't exist in the record on appeal, yet, caused the case to be docketed and prosecuted.  FYI, the record on appeal is at these links,\r\n\r\nhttps://edca.2dca.org/DcaDocs/2019/1914/2019-1914_Brief_530010_RC09.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201005171650/https://edca.2dca.org/DcaDocs/2019/1914/2019-1914_Brief_530010_RC09.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://www.indybay.org/uploads/2024/11/25/record_on_appeal_2019-1914_comp64mb.pdf\r\n\r\nThis request applies to only documents not currently in the record on appeal.  The public and myself has the record on appeal or has access to all documents in the record on appeal.  What is missing are the papers authored by your office that initiated the arraignment, docketing and commencement of the case in June 2017.  Less than 3 pages, if they exist at all.  Please respond with a non-frivolous response that has some basis in reality and limit the request to June 2017.  \r\n\r\nFurther only supply documents authored and filed by Amira Dajani Fox or her subordinates from 6/1/2017 to 6/30/2017.  Obviously,  this request seeks only case initiation and service documents (the request is withdrawn for any documents listing a criminal statute because none exist).  June 2017 documents only are requested.\r\n\r\nThe only documents that currently exist in the record on appeal for June 2017 are as follows (from the index of the record on appeal);\r\n01 12/21/2018 Case Summary/Progress Docket 21 - 51\r\n02 06/05/2017 Order to Show Cause 52 - 54\r\n03 06/29/2017 Court Minutes Held on 6-29-17 55 - 56\r\n04 07/10/2017 Order on Arraignment 57 - 58\r\n\r\nVery odd that the first entry in the record on appeal for 17-mm-815  is a \"Case Summary/Progress Docket\" (2018), the wrong year.  Also odd that an order from a Circuit Court civil case somehow got filed in 17-mm-815 as the 2nd docket entry absent the identity of the filing party.  Due Process is not about mysterious anonymous filings.   Docket entry 2 is also missing over 100 pages of attachments.  Court  minutes is the final docket entry in June 2017.  Corruptly missing is any paper authored and filed by the 20th Circuit State Attorney in June 2017, these are the missing papers \"ghost documents\"  that this request seeks.\r\n\r\nAs your office didn't become involved until 6/29/2017 (allegedly), the time frame involved in this request has been reduced to June 2017.  After all, criminal cases don't get initiated by slight-of-hand or smoke-and-mirrors so something happened first that is not in the record.  Those \"ghost documents\" are sought in this request.  Real court filings and service initiate cases in the Florida courts seemingly quite unlike 17-mm-815.  \r\n\r\nThe record on appeal is a .pdf searchable file and the prior document production estimated cost is an illegal tactic to evade accountability by inflating the alleged costs of document production.  A search on \"FS\" or \"F.S.\" amazingly reveals no responsive documents that contain a criminal statute exist in the record on appeal.  Regardless, the request for documents containing a Florida criminal statute has been withdrawn -- none exist pursuant to the official record on appeal.  That part of the document request is moot and has been withdrawn.\r\n\r\nNOTE : THIS DOCUMENT REQUEST HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE MONTH OF JUNE 2017 ONLY AS ARRAINGMENT WAS HELD ON 6/29/2017 and docketing began on 6/30/2017. PLEASE PRODUCE THE DOCUMENTS AUTHORED AND SERVED BY THE 20TH STATE'S ATTORNEY CAUSING/INITIATING STATE V. HUMINSKI, 17-MM-815 supporting the \"arraignment\" as described by the presiding judge.  Plaintiff State of Florida must have authored and filed something in June 2017 unless 17-mm-815 was purely an exercise in corruption, harassment, lawfare, manipulation of court dockets and weaponized justice.\r\n\r\nI will pay any fees related to the tiny involvement and documents authored, if any, by subordinates of Amira Dajani Fox in the month of June 2017. Criminal case don't just pop up on a docket absent participation of the plaintiff.   Absent such documentary support, the prosecution was a criminal fraud, unconstitutional, official crime and vastly unethical.  No documents satisfying this request exist in the record on appeal, no need to search there.  The records sought are not in the record on appeal and were authored in June 2017 that initiated 17-mm-815, if any.  This request seeks those ghost documents.  Ghost documents do not comply with Due Process under the State or Federal constitutions.\r\n\r\nPlease supply a new quotation involving only the month of June 2017 only.    As the record on appeal contains no papers authored or filed by Amira Dajani Fox Subordinates in June 2017, this request requires no substantial time to complete.    \r\n\r\nTHE ESSENCE OF THIS REQUEST IS JUST HOW DID AMIRA DAJANI FOX AND HER SUBORDINATES GET 17-MM-815 DOCKETED ON 6/30/2017 AND ARRAIGNED ON 6/29/2017.  Currently a mystery which is not consistent with the ethical and lawful litigation of anything in the United States.\r\n\r\nAttached is a draft writ of coram nobis / Motion to Vacate  that will be filed after your production of the requested documents or after a \"no responsive documents\" reply by your office.  The Writ is predicated upon zero filing of anything by Amira Dajani Fox subordinates in June 2017 and may be filed as an action in federal court (constitutional violations) although it currently contemplates a State Circuit Court or 2 DCA filing.  Your prompt and expedited response is required to advance the interests of justice involving an attack upon a hopelessly corrupt and void ab initio judgment of conviction.  \r\n\r\nRules and procedures need to be followed when initiating a court case, not behind-the-scenes corrupt manipulation of dockets by courthouse and State's Attorney staff.  At hearing, Anthony Kunasek (deceased) quite properly stated that a new docket number is not created for contempt matters.  At least one employee of the 20th Circuit State's Attorney knew some of the correct law governing contempt, but, he could not disobey the wishes of Amira Dajani Fox to advance a constitutionally infirm criminal prosecution.",

Please supply the document that the Fl Supreme Court opined MUST EXIST.  (extant information, indictment, or presentment)  Govern your conduct by the below authorities.  Obviously there has to be a document or 17-mm-815 would not have existed as the Supreme Court indicates.  \r\n\r\nThe Florida Supreme Court has explained that \"jurisdiction to try an accused does not exist under article I, section 15 of the Florida Constitution unless there is an extant information, indictment, or presentment filed by the state.\" State v. Anderson, 537 So.2d 1373, 1374 (Fla.1989).\r\nSee, e.g., Ex parte Reed,101 Fla. 800, 135 So. 302, 303 (1931) (concluding that judgment of conviction by circuit court was void where indictment failed to show that the defendant was charged with a felony). Pope v.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAccording to the the CMS Website, in 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) developed and implemented the Fraud Prevention System (\u201cFPS\u201d), now FPS2, to implement predictive analytics technologies to identify and prevent the payment of fraudulent claims in the Medicare Fee-for-Service Program. The FPS 2 develops models to identify fraud waste and abuse and monitor the models to validate effective alerting.\r\n\r\nI am seeking:\r\n\r\n1) Contracts, memorandums of understanding, and statements of work between the department and any outside party regarding the implementation and development of FPS2 of any service to detect or predict fraud\r\n\r\n2) Documentation of FPS 2 or predictive models that the agency currently uses (including those used as aids to human decision making). This documentation should include, where available: executive summaries of the algorithm/model's purpose, lists of the data sources, breakdowns of how the model weights various input data, descriptions of the statistical or machine learning techniques employed, the results of validation and accuracy testing, disparate impact studies, and algorithmic impact reports.\r\n\r\n3) A data dictionary/library for each predictive or detection model or algorithm identified in response to items 1 and 2 of this requests.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of any internal or independent audits of the identified models or algorithms.\r\n\r\n5) Aggregate or disaggregated data, if any exists, breaking down the risk scores or outputs of the fraud model.\r\n\r\n6) Training data code and model files for the above algorithms.\r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of information regarding the use of predictive analytics will contribute significantly to public understanding of how CMS uses advanced machine learning technology. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory\r\nexemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to\r\nonly a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and\r\nprovide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me or call\r\nme. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under the provisions of the Freedom of Information\r\nAct (5 U.S.C. Section 552).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Pieter van der Hurk, aka Peter Hurkos (May 21, 1911 \u2013 June 1, 1988). Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and psychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988. During this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he used this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson. Mr. Hurkos was himself arrested by the FBI on February 9, 1964, for impersonation of an FBI agent; he was found guilty and fined $1,000.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Hurkos's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). As noted above, Mr. Hurkos was a public figure arrested for impersonating a federal agent. Records pertaining to this investigation and the government's handling of it, along with any of Mr. Hurkos's other activities, would be of public interest. \r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am requesting the\r\nfollowing: Copies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records,\r\ndocuments, and communications responsive to Pieter van der Hurk, aka Peter\r\nHurkos (May 21, 1911 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c June 1, 1988). Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and\r\npsychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988.\r\nDuring this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he\r\nused this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest\r\nof Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson. Mr. Hurkos was\r\nhimself arrested by the FBI on February 9, 1964, for impersonation of an FBI\r\nagent; he was found guilty and fined $1,000. Proof of death is not required as\r\nMr. Hurkos's date of birth was over 100 years ago. I am asking you waive any\r\nfees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My\r\nbylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the\r\nGeopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic\r\npublications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an\r\naward-winning and nationally-recognized news organization.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the thousand oaks police Department\u2019s use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the Department\u2019s use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the department\u2019s aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the department used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the Department\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

This review includes determining whether any information should be withheld from disclosure under the exemptions set forth in NY Public Officers Law section 87(2).  I note that any emails or attachments which include proprietary, confidential, or business sensitive information are required to undergo an additional review by ICF as set forth in NY Public Officers Law section 89(5).  This additional review entails NYSERDA seeking a confidentiality justification letter from ICF, ICF reviewing each responsive email and attachment sent to it and drafting a letter to NYSERDA with its confidentiality assertions.\r\n\r\nGiven this, NYSERDA anticipates completing its review of the responsive records no later than August 30.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nColleen Dawson\r\nSenior Counsel\r\n\r\nNYSERDA\r\n17 Columbia Circle | Albany, NY 12203-6399\r\nP: 518-862-1090 ext. 3454 | C: 518-928-7510 | Email: Colleen.Dawson@nyserda.ny.gov<mailto:Colleen.Dawson@nyserda.ny.gov>\r\nnyserda.ny.gov<http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/>\r\nfollow : friend : connect with NYSERDA<http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/Social-Media>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0]\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0]<https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About>  [cid:image003.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGqdNxvmqT0>\n",

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock.

Your request was received in this office on 7/5/24 and\r\nassigned FOIA tracking number 24-52178.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to plans and maps for the naval base at Adak. This\r\nrecord is identified as Record Group 181: Adak Facilities Drawings. You can\r\nsee the description for this series in our catalog at\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/id/124087467. We'll attach a finding aid that\r\nshows the full listing for plans available for Adak. You can request these\r\nrecords using their folder number listed in the finding aid.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs reviewed under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, there are no\r\nrestrictions on access and these records are open and available for\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThe Cartographic Research Room is open to researchers Monday through\r\nFriday, 9:00 am - 5:00 pm, except on federal holidays.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

It directly addresses systemic failures in Medicaid oversight, ADA enforcement, and whistleblower protections\u2014issues central to the lives of millions of Americans and critical to the integrity of federal and state programs. By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

These accommodations were explicitly requested to address accessibility needs stemming from my traumatic brain injury and to ensure compliance with federal law. To date, your office has failed to meet these requirements, resulting in undue barriers and systemic non-compliance.\r\n\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\nTo rectify these ongoing failures and ensure compliance with federal laws, I demand the following actions be taken without delay:\r\n\r\nTransition All Communications to MuckRock\r\n\r\nImmediately cease the use of external portals or non-compliant communication methods and ensure all responses are routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform.\r\nProvide Accessible Documents\r\n\r\nReformat and resend all previously provided documents as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed to ensure accessibility.\r\nInclude Simplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide simplified summaries for all complex or technical records, both previously shared and in future communications, to ensure accessibility and equitable participation.\r\nIdentify Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nInclude the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for every communication moving forward to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\nLegal Basis for Compliance\r\nYour office is legally obligated to comply with these accommodations under the following statutes and principles:\r\n\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandate reasonable accommodations and accessibility in communications for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA): 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 requires transparency, accessibility, and adherence to procedural fairness.\r\nConstitutional Protections: The First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution safeguard my rights to petition the government, due process, and equal protection under the law.\r\nExecutive Order 13392: Mandates improved agency disclosure of information to enhance transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nYour office must confirm compliance with these accommodations and provide the requested corrective actions within five (5) business days of this notice. Continued non-compliance will be documented as a violation of the ADA and FOIA and may result in escalation, including:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Seeking injunctive relief and damages for ADA and FOIA violations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic failures to oversight agencies, media, and advocacy organizations.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis communication serves as a final request for compliance. It is imperative that your office address these deficiencies promptly to restore transparency, accessibility, and adherence to federal law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and resolution by the stated deadline.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nCC\r\nFederal Officials\r\nMerrick B.

Garland, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice\r\nKristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, DOJ\r\nMichael E. Horowitz, Inspector General, DOJ\r\nXavier Becerra, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, Administrator, CMS\r\nAlina M. Semo, Director, OGIS\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis appeal addresses the improper handling of my FOIA request (originally submitted on November 23, 2024) and the failure to comply with ADA-mandated accommodations. The District of Columbia Department of Health incorrectly identified itself as the agency responsible for processing the request, resulting in unnecessary delays. Furthermore, the response fails to meet statutory obligations for ADA accommodations, transparency, and procedural fairness under both federal and District law.\r\n\r\nKey Issues\r\n1. Misrouting of FOIA Request\r\nThe FOIA request explicitly sought records from federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), not from the District of Columbia government. It is concerning that:\r\n\r\nThe DC Department of Health did not recognize this jurisdictional error upon receipt and failed to proactively forward the request to the appropriate federal agency. Example: \u201cThe agency's failure to forward my FOIA request violates FOIA\u2019s 20-business-day response requirement under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i).\u201d\r\nThe District has stopped the processing clock and redirected the burden of correction back to the requester, despite clear principles under FOIA and ADA requiring assistance to ensure timely access to records.\r\n2. Failure to Provide ADA Accommodations \u201cFOIA and ADA regulations require public entities to provide reasonable assistance to ensure accessibility, particularly for individuals with documented disabilities.\u201d\r\nMy original request included explicit ADA accommodations, which have been ignored:\r\n\r\nMuckRock Platform Only: Communications must be routed exclusively through MuckRock. This request has been disregarded, forcing the use of inaccessible external portals.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs: Requested records must be in accessible formats. The response failed to confirm adherence to this requirement.\r\nSimplified Summaries: Complex documents require simplified summaries, which have not been provided.\r\n3. Procedural and Constitutional Violations\r\nThe mishandling of my request infringes upon my constitutional and statutory rights:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Denial of access to requested records obstructs my right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\nFifth Amendment: Delayed responses and failure to provide accommodations violate my procedural due process rights.\r\nADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: By not fulfilling the requested accommodations, your response discriminates against me as an individual with a documented disability.\r\nRelief Requested \u201cAs established in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), public agencies must ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to governmental processes and information.\u201d\r\nTo rectify these issues, I demand the following actions:\r\n\r\n1. Immediate Forwarding of the FOIA Request\r\nThe DC Department of Health must immediately forward my FOIA request to the appropriate federal agency:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \u2013 Office of Information Policy (OIP)\r\n2. Full ADA Compliance\r\nEnsure all future communications comply with ADA and Rehabilitation Act requirements:\r\n\r\nUse the MuckRock platform exclusively for all communications.\r\nProvide all responsive documents in screen-reader-compatible PDF formats, clearly labeled.\r\nInclude simplified summaries of technical or complex documents.\r\n3. Identification of Responsible Personnel\r\nProvide the full names, titles, and roles of all individuals involved in processing this request. Transparency is a cornerstone of both FOIA and public trust.\r\n\r\n4. Statutory Justifications for Delays and Denials\r\nProvide detailed statutory justifications for any delays, denials, or redactions, citing specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) or relevant District codes.  \u201cThe explicit reference to the U.S. Department of Justice in the subject line and body of my request clearly delineates the intended recipient. The failure to identify and correct this jurisdictional error demonstrates systemic procedural negligence.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the urgency of public interest in ADA enforcement, Medicaid oversight, and whistleblower protections, I demand expedited processing of this appeal. \u201cUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), whistleblower protections are violated when individuals are obstructed from reporting systemic failures in governance and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nConsequences of Continued Non-Compliance\r\nIf the above issues are not resolved within 10 business days, I will escalate this matter through all available legal and administrative channels:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) and the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG).\r\nJudicial Remedies: Pursuing injunctive relief and damages for violations of FOIA, ADA, and constitutional rights.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic non-compliance to oversight committees, advocacy organizations, and media outlets.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal is submitted with an expectation of immediate corrective action to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and accessibility enshrined in federal and District law. Given the urgency of the matter and its public interest implications, I request a resolution within 10 business days. Failure to comply will result in formal escalation to oversight bodies and judicial forums to ensure justice and systemic reform.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue. I look forward to your prompt response.This appeal underscores the importance of transparency, accessibility, and accountability in public governance. I expect the requested actions to be addressed promptly and fully. Failure to act will only exacerbate public mistrust and systemic inefficiencies.\r\n\u201cThis request is essential to addressing systemic failures in ADA enforcement, Medicaid oversight, and whistleblower protections, directly impacting vulnerable populations and taxpayer accountability.\u201d\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf. https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf\r\nhttps://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\nDB42131inf\r\n\r\nCC\r\nMerrick Garland\r\nTitle: U.S. Attorney General\r\nEmail: askdoj@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: DOJ operations, FOIA compliance, ADA enforcement.\r\n\r\nKristen Clarke\r\nTitle: Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division\r\nEmail: civilrights.justice@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: ADA enforcement and civil rights compliance.\r\n\r\nBobak Talebian\r\nTitle: Director, Office of Information Policy (DOJ)\r\nEmail: oip.foia@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: DOJ FOIA policy and appeals.\r\n\r\nMichael E.

This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions. Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the foundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal mandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can overcome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.",

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following.\r\n\r\nYour request is being preprocessed to another open request on the same subject, meaning a request on the same subject had been received and was already in process prior to receipt of your request.  To avoid duplicative efforts, you will receive the same releases at the same time as the original requester for this subject.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Interim releases are generally made for complex requests.\r\n\r\nYou have the opportunity to reduce the scope of your request; this will accelerate the process and could potentially place your request in a quicker processing queue.  This may also allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  The FBI uses a multi-track processing system to fairly assign and process new requests.  Simple track cases (50 pages or less) usually require the least time to process.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is considered a complex case in our large track.  Please advise us in writing if you would like to discuss reducing the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.",

Please consider the modified request below:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll internal memos/callouts regarding the implementation of \"task-based\" work sent to eligibility supervisors and eligibility workers from DPSS \"line operations\" (between 1/1/2021 and 12/31/2021). For reference, I am interested in how administrators communicated the shift from case-based work to task-based work to district office staff in 2021 (when most eligibility units shifted to a task-based system). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJosh Seim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
