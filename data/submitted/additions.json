        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to convicted criminal and union boss Constantine Victorio \"Tony\" Baruso (born December 28th 1927 - Died November 14th 2008).  \r\n\r\nMr. Baruso, a prominent labor leader and president of a Seattle-area chapter of the Alaska Cannery Workers Union, died in prison in Washington State in 2008 following a conviction for first degree murder in 1991. Baruso is alleged to have been involved in two murders that were related to the victim's political support of opponents of the regime of President Marcos of the Philippines. Considering that Mr. Baruso was a figure in a murder plot with alleged connections to foreign governments it is likely that investigations into Mr. Baruso by the bureau were undertaken following the murders in 1981. \r\n\r\nBaruso's 2008 death was widely reported in the news media: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tony-baruso-former-union-president-convicted-of-murder-dies-in-prison/\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Constantine Victorio \"Tony\" Baruso from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Constantine Baruso held by the Seattle or Anchorage field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Constantine Baruso.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Constantine Baruso. .\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Constantine Baruso.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for any correspondence either to or from directors William Webster, William Sessions, Louis Freeh, or Robert Mueller, where Baruso is mentioned - specifically regarding the investigation into Baruso, Baruso's trial, or Baruso's imprisonment. \r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
