When I said neither, they replied, they already killed George Floyd and no one cared, so it doesn't matter.\u201d\r\nd.\tAll records from any complaint he filed through investigation and final adjudication of his allegation. \u201cWhen I spoke about the displacement of VMI's first black superintendent, threats escalated.\u201d\r\ne.\t All records from any complaint he filed through investigation and final adjudication of his allegation, as well as any social media posting to Jodel or other platforms, and responses from other cadets for his allegation. \u201cOne social media circulating among cadets. \u201cAll con. All con. President Trump has just passed the N-word, I'm going to effing kill you act. #Beadvised.\u201d \u2013 I understand that Jodel is an anonymous application, but also understand cadets and VMI administrators have administrative access and that postings to social media are not protected under FERPA or the FOIA.\r\nf.\tRecords of the RAT class trips to New Market from Mr. Woods Matriculation year to the present including any scripts, talking points or agendas for the trips and rosters for cadets attending in response to his allegation: \u201cEach year, cadets are taken to the Battle of New Market and taught how Confederate troops who fought exemplify the highest level of the Brother RAT spirit while enslaved people who supported VMI are erased.\u201d This is to include, without limitation, the specific record of the year(s) Mr. Woods attended the New Market event.\r\ng.\tMr. Woods stated: \u201cIn 2021, VMI was required by law to establish a memorial and a scholarship. While VMI is the only institution of the five institutions named in the law, VMI has not yet established that memorial.\u201d \u2013 Provide records of this requirement and the current status.\r\nh.\tMr. Woods stated: \u201cJackson Hope board named after Stonewall Jackson.\u201d \u2013 Provide the charter and results of the BOV review of monuments and namings report regarding the Jackson-Hope Medal.\r\ni.\tMr. Woods stated on Social Media: \u201cOn 2025, I conducted historical research on enslaved African Americans who lived and worked at VMI, drawing from primary institutional sources. I presented this research publicly to a standing-room-only audience that included VMI officials and local elected leaders. My work demonstrated that enslaved people were essential to the daily operation of the institute, yet their lives remain largely absent from VMI\u2019s Official commemorative landscape.\u201d \u2013 It is my understanding this was a SURI project entitled \u201cAfrican Americans at VMI 1851 \u2013 1865\u201d under the VMI History Department. I request the record, including his research report with all underlying empirical information, his faculty and other advisors, reviews and drafts of his paper, correspondences regarding his paper and research, presentations, and attendance at the event he references.\r\nj.\tIn his social media posts, he mentions building names after Confederate figures \u2013 I request a copy of the final monuments and memorials review report to the BOV and the BOV\u2019s approval of said report.\r\nk.\tMr. Woods identifies \u201cconfederate artillery\u201d named \u201cMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John\u201d \u2013 records showing the confederate lineage of these weapons.\r\nl.\tMr. Woods stated on social media: \u201cBefore ever speaking I met privately and repeatedly over the course of two years with Institute Officials across multiple administrations. I raised concerns about racial hostility, retaliation, and equity. These concerns were acknowledged, but meaningful change but did not follow.\u201d \u2013 All records of these meetings especially with cadet leadership, Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, Lt. Gen. Furness, the DEI/DOI/Inclusive excellence staffs or other Institute officials he met with.\r\nm.\tMr. Wood stated \u201cracist and threatening statements made by cadets on social media are real and documented.\u201d \u2013 copies of these posts.\r\n4.\tCommunications of any kind with Lt. Gen. David Furness, Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, Col. Tinni Sen, Col. Keith Kline, or any member of the Title IX or DEO/DEI/Inclusive Excellence office from the date of his arrival at VMI to the present.\r\n\r\nThese allegations are a matter of great public interest and had significant impact of the General Assembly\u2019s decision not move the bill to study if VMI should continue to receive state funding forward.  It is in the best interest of the public and VMI, especially its cadets, the facts of this matter are made public. To that end I request any fee for this FOIA be waived.\r\n\r\nFurther, in the past, VMI responded vaguely stating you could not locate some records.  In regard to the complaints Mr. Woods alleges he made should the search find no records I quest VMI clarify this by confirming \u201cno record of any such complaint was found.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is in VMI\u2019s best interest for the facts of this matter to be clear.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for information, that information is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the information is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort. The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request. Within the next ten (10) days, we will determine whether your request seeks copies of disclosable records in the City's possession or whether the City will require an extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCity Clerk's Office\r\n\r\n(831) 768-3048\r\n\r\n275 Main Street, Suite 400, Watsonville, CA 95076\r\n\r\nFAX:&nbsp;831-761-0736\r\n\r\nE-mail:&nbsp;&nbsp;cityclerk@watsonville.gov\r\n\r\nOpen Monday - Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact City of Watsonville, CA.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://cityofwatsonvilleca.nextrequest.com/settings?id=2537480\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",

Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for information, that information is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the information is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort. The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request. Within the next ten (10) days, we will determine whether your request seeks copies of disclosable records in the City's possession or whether the City will require an extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCity Clerk's Office\r\n\r\n(831) 768-3048\r\n\r\n275 Main Street, Suite 400, Watsonville, CA 95076\r\n\r\nFAX:&nbsp;831-761-0736\r\n\r\nE-mail:&nbsp;&nbsp;cityclerk@watsonville.gov\r\n\r\nOpen Monday - Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact City of Watsonville, CA.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://cityofwatsonvilleca.nextrequest.com/settings?id=2537475\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",
