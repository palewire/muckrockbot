Upon arrival, deputies found the victim sweating profusely and suffering from a deep stab wound that required transport to Orlando Regional Medical Center as a trauma alert. Initial statements from the victim\u2019s mother falsely claimed the injury was accidental, but another relative later reported hearing an argument between the victim and Ralston. Deputies questioned Ralston, who admitted to arguing with the victim, spraying each other with a kitchen faucet, and then waving a knife, which ultimately stabbed the victim. Due to the severity of the injury, Ralston was arrested for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and booked into the Lake County Jail.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who responded to the incident, including footage of the initial response, witness statements, and the suspect\u2019s questioning.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Regan allegedly pulled out a 9mm handgun before Stiles shoved it away, leading to a physical fight in which Regan bit off the top of Stiles\u2019 ear. The injury was severe, and the ear was unable to be reattached.
