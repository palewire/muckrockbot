Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative documents. \r\n(g) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person or business where the trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged, or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm to the person or business, and only insofar as the claim directly applies to the records requested. \r\n(h) Proposals and bids for any contract, grant, or agreement, including information which if it were disclosed would frustrate procurement or give an advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contractor agreement with the body, until an award or final selection is made.

Information exempt under this item may include such things as details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel or equipment, to the operation of communication systems or protocols, or to tactical operations. \r\n\r\n___\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Disclosure of the records would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \u00a71, \u00a77(1)(c) \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSylwia Slodyczka \r\nDeputy FOIA Officer \r\nVillage of Oak Brook \r\n1200 Oak Brook Rd.

This request must be made within 10 business days from the receipt of the request. (Sec. 552.301). Your office acknowledged receipt of my request on October 10, 2023 and have failed to request a decision from the Texas Attorney\u2019 Office to withhold any documents.\r\n\r\nThe request for the following documents have been denied by your office:\r\n\u2022\tA copy of the complaint against Officer Oscar Mendoza. A complaint was not found in the Employee File released.\r\n\u2022\tA copy of the IA Report for the complaint against Officer Oscar Mendoza.\r\n\r\nThe department has provided a copy of some type of disciplinary action taken against Officer Oscar Mendoza, meaning you must have first complied with Section 614.023 of the Texas Government Code:\r\n\u2022\tSec. 614.023.  COPY OF COMPLAINT TO BE GIVEN TO OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE.  \r\n\u2022\tA copy of a signed complaint against a law enforcement officer of this state or a fire fighter, detention officer, county jailer, or peace officer appointed or employed by a political subdivision of this state shall be given to the officer or employee within a reasonable time after the complaint is filed.\r\n\u2022\tDisciplinary action may not be taken against the officer or employee unless a copy of the signed complaint is given to the officer or employee.\r\n\u2022\tIn addition to the requirement of Subsection (b), the officer or employee may not be indefinitely suspended or terminated from employment based on the subject matter of the complaint unless:\r\no\tthe complaint is investigated; and\r\no\tthere is evidence to prove the allegation of misconduct.\r\n\r\nThere are two recent Attorney General Decisions that address Internal Affairs Reports you had available to review. Cornyn OR99-1167 and Abbott OR 2012-02011.\r\nWith the evidence of disciplinary action taken against Officer Oscar Mendoza, I am requesting copies of the documents previously withheld by your department. If the department continues to withhold the requested documents, we will file a Formal Criminal Complaint with the Brazoria County District Attorney\u2019s Office and then to the Texas Attorney\u2019s Office for your violation of the Texas Public Information Act.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the documents as required by Texas Law.\r\n\r\nAttached:\r\n\r\n\tOAG Decision: Abbott OR2012-02011\r\n\tOAG Decision: Cornyn OR99-1167\r\n\tDraft copy of Formal Complaint to District Attorney\u2019s Office\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

The GSTP submit this request pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  \u00a7 552, implementing regulations 8 C.F.R.  \u00a7 103.10 and 6 C.F.R.  \u00a7 5 and any other applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nCommunity members, civil rights organizations, and mainstream media have reported that the FBI is surveilling and infiltrating Muslim American communities and building a dragnet that is detrimentally affecting the lives of innocent Americans. We have seen FBI spying exposed in communities in Northern California, New York and Minnesota. Muslims in Oregon routinely report being harassed and followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We\u2019ve seen the leaks of former FBI Agent Terry Albury who exposed wide-spread unwarranted and unconstitutional surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the country and a culture of Islamophobia within the bureau. Former FBI Agent Terry Albury said the Federal Bureau of Investigation routinely targeted innocent and vulnerable Muslim Americans and said the Federal Bureau of Investigation ruined lives.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nWe are seeking disclosure of agency records in your possession that fall within the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)  Individual records related to FBI activities in Washington from September 11, 2001, to the present pertaining to:\r\n       \r\n      a.  FBI investigations and assessments of mosques; Islamic centers; Muslim community centers; Muslim organizations; members of mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim community centers based on their membership or affiliation with such centers; Muslim leaders; and imams;\r\n      b.  Domain management, including but not limited to maps or other records relating to or describing \"domains;\" and records of\"concentrated ethnic communities,\" \"ethnic-oriented businesses or nonprofits\" and any other records related to \"community race and ethnicity\" analyses or assessments in the FBI \"domains\" of Washington. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\n\r\nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests for information in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a \"compelling need.\"\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8 FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States residents, both aliens and citizens. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR WAIVER OF PROCESSING FEES UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF THE REQUESTED INFORMATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nWe also request a fee waiver for duplication costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(ii)(ll)-(iii). Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. It will further public understanding of government conduct, in particular the FBl's policies, practices, and methods of surveillance including the use of informants, the use of informants in terrorism-related prosecutions, the rate at which investigations and assessments of Muslim communities result in criminal and other prosecutions. We are well situated to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nBROAD INTERPRETATION OF REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request should be interpreted to include records maintained by FBI headquarters or any field office or task force including the Seattle FBI Field Office, Washington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and U.S. / National Joint Terrorism Task Force but not limited to such.\r\n\r\nI affirm that the information provided supporting the request for expedited processing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Acta",

We are well situated\r\n    to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to\r\n    affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and\r\n    to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the\r\n    requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of\r\n    further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial\r\n    of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in\r\n    part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific\r\n    provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all\r\n    segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to\r\n    appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\n# Expedite\r\n\r\nExpedite Reason\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Title 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests\r\n    for information in cases in which the person requesting the records\r\n    demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons\r\n    primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public\r\n    concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a\r\n    \"compelling need.\"\u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice\r\n    regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing\r\n    when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and\r\n    exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the\r\n    government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\r\n    16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily\r\n    engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below,\r\n    there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government\r\n    activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8\r\n    FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been\r\n    widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns\r\n    about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious\r\n    profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States\r\n    residents, both aliens and citizens.\r\n\r\n** \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

If you have not\r\nreceived a FOIPA request number, your request is in the process of being\r\nopened at which time it will be assigned a FOIPA request number and\r\ncorrespondence will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n** \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of your FOIPA request number, you may check the status of your\r\nFOIPA request on the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronic FOIA Library (The Vault) on the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\r\npublic website, http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCheck Status of Your\r\nFOI/PA Request tool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 link.
