Specifically this is a request for any presentations created for, or delivered to, members of the Presidential Transition Team for the new Administration (2nd Trump term) in November and December 2024. Please include any materials (documents, Excel files, PowerPoint presentations, audio/visual) from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (or \"PCAST\") which is under the umbrella of the Office of Science of Technology Policy. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is information related to pandemic planning or deliberations related to executive branch planning for the responses to the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV, Monkeypox, COVID-19, West Nile virus, Coxsackie, H1N1, etc. \r\n\r\nAccording to several books and much media coverage, President Trump claimed at the outset of the COVID-19 that there was no nearly no documentation or planning shared during the 2016/2017 transition related to pandemic planning, while members of the Obama administration have publicly claimed that OSTP pandemic planning documents were ignored. Any documents related to the efficacy of the Biden administration's response to Monkeypox or Covid-19 or HIV would be of particular interest. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Office of Science and Technology Policy's commitment to transparency. The release of these documents would be of a great public benefit in understanding the pandemic and the public health challenges we face.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629. The original request sought the following: Incident Reports, 911 Audio, Dispatch Recordings, Body Cam Footage, and a CAD Log.

Instead, the agency is obligated to produce any non-exempt records that are reasonably identifiable and within scope. Additionally, Incident Reports are a standard type of document routinely requested and disclosed by this agency.

Specifically, this grant and sub-award are described on USASpending.gov:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nMy initial FOIA request was rejected with the following text: \"There are no records responsive to your request. There were no technical or research reports for this project.\" See IDA Letter 2025-00131-F. I am sending a copy of this IDA letter to DHA.FOIAappeals@health.mil , as requested in the said letter.\r\n\r\nI want to draw your attention to the fact that $750,000 were paid to Wayne State University by the DOD. This included a sub-award WSU23001 in the amount of  $218,562  to Michigan State University. Sub-award description found on the same USAspending.gov page is as follows:\r\n\r\n'IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #1, WE WILL EXPOSE GYRENCEPHALIC FERRETS (N = 48), WHICH ARE UNLIKE LISSENCEPHALIC ANIMALS (MICE AND RATS), TO RF WAVES FOR TWO HOURS/DAY FOR SIXTY DAYS USING A SOURCE \r\n OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN EXPOSURE PROFILE THAT IS LIKELY COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL RECEIVED. SOME ADDITIONAL ANIMALS (N = 24) WILL RECEIVE SHAM EXPOSURE. IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AN ANIMAL MODEL WITH THE BRAIN STRUCTURES RESEMBLING THE GYRENCEPHALIC NATURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN; MICE AND RATS DO NOT FULFIL THOSE CRITERIA.\r\n \r\n IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #2, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER RF WAVE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, COCHLEAR, OR VESTIBULAR CHANGES AMONG THE FERRETS AFTER TWO MONTHS COMPARED TO SHAM \r\n EXPOSED ANIMALS.\r\n \r\nPROJECT MILESTONES\r\n OUR MILESTONES WILL BE: (1) FULL ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL AT TWO MONTHS; (2) TESTING OF RF WAVE GENERATOR/RECEIVERS BY THE FOURTH MONTH; (3) TESTING COHORTS OF FERRETS [8 FERRETS/MONTH] FOR RF WAVE EXPOSURE WITH BEHAVIORAL, RADIOGRAPHIC, HISTOPATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR ANALYSES BETWEEN FOUR AND \r\n TWELVE MONTHS; (4) FINAL DATA ANALYSES AT ONE YEAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement of rejection issued in the IDA Letter 2025-00131-F doesn't  conform with the information available on the USAspending.gov webpage describing Project Grant FAIN W81XWH2211105 and sub-award WSU23001:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeonid Ber",

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

        "communication": "Subject: Formal Demand for Immediate Remedial Action for Non-Compliance with ADA Accommodations and FOIA Legal Obligations (FOIA Request No. 25-00044-F)\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am submitting this formal demand to address and rectify specific, documented non-compliances related to ADA accommodations and FOIA requirements associated with FOIA request No. 25-00044-F. These non-compliances represent failures to meet federally mandated ADA standards and statutory requirements under both federal and Connecticut FOIA regulations. To ensure compliance with the law, I require immediate corrective action on each point detailed below.\r\n\r\n1. Non-Compliance with ADA-Requested Email-Only Communication\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 10, 2024\r\nDetails: Despite my explicit ADA request for communications to be conducted solely via direct email (not through any portals, links, or external systems), the agency responded through a digital portal. This action contravenes my rights under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and disregards the duty to provide accessible, reasonable accommodations. Federal ADA standards prohibit agencies from imposing communication methods that are inaccessible or unduly burdensome, particularly for individuals with disabilities that affect cognitive or visual processing.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: Effective immediately, all communications related to FOIA request No. 25-00044-F must be provided exclusively via email, with no external links, portals, or ancillary access requirements. Failure to adopt this modification constitutes a denial of access under ADA standards.\r\n\r\n2. Requirement for Direct Text Embedding in Email Body\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: On this date, the agency provided a PDF attachment rather than embedding relevant information directly within the email body. Under ADA Title II and Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-210 and 1-211, I am entitled to receive information in an accessible format. Embedding the text within the email body ensures compatibility with screen readers, thereby allowing full, unimpeded access to requested information, in compliance with the ADA.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: All future communications must embed relevant content directly within the body of the email to meet ADA and FOIA accessibility requirements. This modification is essential to ensure I receive information in a format that accommodates my ADA-protected disability.\r\n\r\n3. Obligation to Provide Properly Formatted PDF Attachments\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: The provided PDF lacked labeling for date and document type, and did not conform to accessible design standards mandated by ADA Title II and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, the PDF failed to meet navigability requirements under the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are incorporated into Section 508 requirements for electronic and information technology.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: All PDF attachments must be fully accessible, labeled by date and document type, and formatted for screen reader compatibility. Failure to adhere to these standards is a violation of ADA accommodations as well as Section 508\u2019s accessibility standards.\r\n\r\n4. Mandatory Disclosure of FOIA Officer Identity and Signature\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: The response provided by the agency failed to include the full name, title, and signature of the responsible officer, in direct contravention of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-212 and 1-213, which require public officers handling FOIA requests to identify themselves. This is essential for transparency and accountability under both FOIA and ADA.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: The agency must provide full identification\u2014including name, title, and a clear signature\u2014of the officer responsible for handling and responding to my FOIA request. Non-compliance with this requirement obstructs transparency and violates statutory obligations for public accountability.\r\n\r\n5. Provision of Simplified Summaries for Complex Information\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: The agency did not provide a simplified summary for a document containing procedural information. ADA regulations (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160) require that communications are as effective for individuals with disabilities as they are for those without, which includes offering simplified summaries when complex information is presented.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: For all documents containing technical or complex information, a simplified summary must accompany the original text to meet ADA requirements for effective communication. This accommodation is critical for ensuring equitable access to public records as guaranteed by federal law.\r\n\r\n6. Requirement for Statutory Justification of Redactions\r\nDetails: While no redactions were made in the latest response, it is essential to establish that if any records are redacted in the future, statutory justification will be provided. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (federal FOIA) and Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 14, \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242, any withholding of information requires specific statutory citations and explicit explanations for each redaction.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: The agency must ensure that any future redactions in records are accompanied by clear statutory justifications in compliance with federal and state FOIA regulations. This action will uphold transparency and guarantee the legal accountability of redaction decisions.\r\n\r\n7. Confirmation of ADA Accommodation Compliance\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: The agency has not confirmed compliance with the specific ADA accommodations I have requested. Title II of the ADA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act obligate public entities to demonstrate their adherence to accommodation requests and to confirm that all legal requirements are being met.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: A formal, written confirmation of ADA accommodation compliance is required immediately. This confirmation must address each of my requests and affirm the agency\u2019s commitment to provide effective accommodations in all future communications regarding FOIA request No. 25-00044-F.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Remedial Action and Legal Adherence\r\nI demand immediate and full compliance with the outlined legal standards for all future responses related to FOIA request No. 25-00044-F. Each issue specified above must be addressed to ensure unqualified adherence to both ADA and FOIA requirements. Further failure to comply with these mandates will be regarded as a continued violation of federal and state law, necessitating formal action to secure my rights under ADA Title II, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, federal FOIA, and Connecticut FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this demand and provide a precise timeline for completion and correction of each item listed. I expect all future communications to meet the highest standards of accessibility, transparency, and compliance with applicable statutes, as required by law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nEmail: aabiwr@live.com",

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\u2022\tA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\u2022\tA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is for the calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, up to and including the day the records are produced. The scope of the request is the Mel H.

L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement. \r\n2.\tSpecifically, I request a database extract including the following variables:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges) including the statute governing the alleged offense \r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n3.\tIf a database extract as described in bullets 1\u20132 is not possible, please provide any existing police reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement. \r\n4.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from the School that were received by your department.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k).

Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\u2022\tA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\u2022\tA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is for the school years 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25, up to and including the day the records are produced. The scope of the request is the Mel H. King Academy South End Academy, formerly known as the McKinley schools, including all records for the following schools:\r\n\u2022\tElementary: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116.\r\n\u2022\tK-12 Academy: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116.\r\n\u2022\tMiddle: 50 St. Mary\u2019s Street, Boston, MA 02215.\r\n\u2022\tPrep: 97 Peterborough Street, Boston, MA 02115.\r\nThroughout this request, \u201cSchool\u201d refers to all of the schools described above. \u201cSchool-related arrest\u201d refers to \u201can arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the School and time period described above, I request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement. \r\n2.\tSpecifically, I request a database extract including the following variables:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges) including the statute governing the alleged offense \r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n3.\tIf a database extract as described in bullets 1\u20132 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement. \r\n4.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from the School that were made to local police departments.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). Moreover, for municipalities with a population of over 20,000, the first two hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record may not be charged a fee. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M.G.L. c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at averyfarmer@cfjj.org.

Do not use physical mail, phone calls, portal-based communications, or any external links. This ensures uninterrupted and barrier-free access to information.\r\n\r\nAccessible Document Formatting:\r\nInclude the full text of each response within the email body, and attach all supporting documents as labeled PDFs, organized by category and date.\r\nEnsure documents are screen reader-compatible to maintain accessibility.\r\n\r\nClear Justifications for Redactions and Denials:\r\nFor any withheld or redacted records, provide a complete justification, including specific statutes or legal exemptions.

Delayed access to these records obstructs effective oversight and hinders efforts to protect vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nJustification for Fee Waiver\r\nThis request seeks information critical to the public interest regarding ADA enforcement, civil rights protections, and DSS\u2019s handling of Medicaid-related complaints. Disclosure will directly benefit public understanding and support governmental accountability.

        "communication": "Subject: Demand for Immediate Compliance with ADA and FOIA Standards for FOIA Request No. 2025-00501-FOIA-PHS\r\n\r\nTo: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \u2013 Office for Civil Rights (OCR)\r\nCC: FOIA Compliance Officers, HHS Supervisory Authorities, and Relevant Oversight Agencies\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am submitting this formal demand to ensure that all responses associated with FOIA request No. 2025-00501-FOIA-PHS are in strict compliance with both the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and ADA requirements under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132). My request for these records involves OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844 and addresses ADA compliance, civil rights enforcement, and whistleblower protections within government programs.\r\n\r\nThis demand details critical deficiencies in your recent communications and reiterates the required accommodations and FOIA standards necessary to achieve legal compliance.\r\n\r\n1. Non-Compliance with ADA Accommodation: Exclusive Email-Only Communication\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 10, 2024\r\nDetails: The agency issued an acknowledgment through a portal link, disregarding my ADA-mandated request for exclusive email-based communications. Under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and federal FOIA guidelines, individuals with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations that avoid barriers to accessibility. Requiring use of a portal to receive responses is non-compliant, as this method presents undue burdens and inhibits effective access for individuals with visual or cognitive disabilities.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: Immediately provide all future FOIA-related communications and records solely via email, directly to AabiWR@live.com, without the use of portal systems, links, or external access barriers. This adjustment is essential to comply with ADA and FOIA standards for reasonable accommodations and equitable access.\r\n\r\n2. Requirement for Accessible Document Formatting in Emails\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: Records provided to date lack essential formatting for screen-reader compatibility, particularly when attachments are sent without embedded text or accessible formatting. Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and ADA guidelines mandates that text is embedded directly within emails or that accessible PDF formats are used to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: All responses must embed key content within the email body and attach supporting documents as screen reader-compatible, labeled PDFs organized by category and date. This structure is necessary to facilitate navigable, ADA-compliant document access.\r\n\r\n3. Full Identification and Accountability of FOIA Officers and Decision-Makers\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: Communications to date have omitted critical identification information, including the full names, titles, and contact information of the officers responsible for handling this request. Under both Connecticut FOIA statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 1-212 and 1-213) and general ADA standards for transparency, it is essential to provide full identification of individuals responsible for the management and oversight of FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: Moving forward, all responses must include the full name, title, and contact information (including email and phone number) of the designated FOIA officer and any supervisory personnel involved. This adherence to transparency is non-negotiable under both ADA and FOIA obligations.\r\n\r\n4. Requirement for Detailed Redaction Justifications\r\nDetails: If any records are redacted or withheld, it is imperative to provide a complete statutory justification for each redaction, along with summaries or descriptions of redacted content where permissible. Under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and corresponding state statutes, agencies are required to disclose specific legal exemptions and reasons for each instance of redaction to ensure transparency and protect the rights of requestors.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: All future redactions must include an explicit citation of the legal grounds for redaction and a description of withheld content to maintain transparency and accessibility.\r\n\r\n5. Provision of Simplified Summaries for Technical Documents\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 8, 2024\r\nDetails: ADA guidelines (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160) mandate that communications be equally effective for individuals with disabilities. Complex documents or procedural communications require simplified summaries to facilitate comprehension, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: Provide simplified summaries for all complex or procedural documents to ensure ADA-compliant accessibility and equitable comprehension of FOIA responses. This accommodation is crucial to maintain effective communication and full access under ADA standards.\r\n\r\n6. Confirmed Compliance with All Requested Accommodations\r\nDate of Non-Compliance: November 10, 2024\r\nDetails: No written confirmation was provided indicating compliance with requested ADA accommodations. Title II of the ADA and Section 508 require public agencies to confirm and implement reasonable accommodations effectively, thus providing confirmation of compliance for transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nRequired Action: The agency must provide a formal, written acknowledgment confirming compliance with each ADA accommodation requested in relation to this FOIA request. This includes adherence to exclusive email-only communication, accessible formatting, clear redaction justifications, and identification of responsible personnel.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing and Fee Waiver\r\nIn addition to standard processing requirements, I request expedited processing for FOIA request No. 2025-00501-FOIA-PHS. Given the significant public interest and potential civil rights implications of OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844, timely access to these records is critical. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), expedited processing is warranted to uphold accountability and to support public awareness of ADA enforcement within federally funded programs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I request a fee waiver for this FOIA request, as disclosure is in the public interest and contributes significantly to government transparency and accountability in matters of ADA and civil rights compliance. This request is strictly non-commercial and aims to promote public understanding of these issues.\r\n\r\nTimeline for Compliance and Legal Basis\r\nThis FOIA request and ADA accommodation appeal are grounded in the following federal statutes:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552): Governing public access to federal records, including requirements for response timelines and specific legal grounds for any redactions or denials.\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132): Mandating reasonable accommodations to ensure access to public records for individuals with disabilities.\r\nSection 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794d): Requiring accessible electronic and information technology in federally funded programs.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this demand and provide a precise timeline for compliance with the above requirements. All responses must be in full adherence to ADA and FOIA standards and furnished exclusively to AabiWR@live.com in the specified accessible formats.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com",

        "communication": "Subject: FOIA Appeal for OCR Transaction Number 01-25-592844 \u2013 ADA Non-Compliance, Obstruction, and Demand for Comprehensive Disclosure\r\n\r\nTo: FOIA Appeals Officer, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\nDate: November 8, 2024\r\n\r\nAppeal of FOIA Response \u2013 Incomplete Compliance with ADA Requirements and FOIA Standards\r\n\r\nI am filing a formal appeal regarding CMS\u2019s inadequate handling of my FOIA request related to OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844. CMS has not complied with ADA-mandated accommodations, failed to conduct a transparent FOIA process, and imposed unnecessary procedural barriers, which hinder public transparency and accessibility.\r\n\r\nBackground and Key Individuals Involved\r\nMy initial FOIA request was submitted to the CMS FOIA Division, OSORA, Division of FOIA Analysis \u2013 A. In response, I received communication from Doris Davis, Government Information Specialist (email: doris.davis@cms.hhs.gov, phone: +1 410-786-5915), redirecting my request to FOIA_Request@cms.hhs.gov. This redirection, rather than transparent processing, has delayed and obstructed access to requested records.\r\n\r\nFurther involved personnel include:\r\n\r\nKaren Jackson, Deputy Director, CMS OSORA, Division of FOIA Analysis, and\r\nMary E. Greene, Director of the Office of Strategic Operations and Regulatory Affairs, who is accountable for CMS\u2019s FOIA compliance and ADA accessibility.\r\nLegal Violations and Procedural Failures\r\n1. Non-Compliance with ADA Standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\nCMS\u2019s refusal to provide my requested ADA accommodations constitutes a clear violation of the ADA and Section 504. These statutes require federal agencies to make reasonable accommodations to ensure individuals with disabilities have equal access. CMS\u2019s imposition of procedural barriers and refusal to honor my accommodation requests amounts to a discriminatory denial of access to public records.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C))\r\nFOIA mandates a \u201creasonable search\u201d designed to locate all relevant documents (see Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). CMS has not demonstrated a complete search across the relevant CMS divisions and OCR, nor provided assurance that all records have been examined. This is a failure to fulfill FOIA\u2019s basic requirements.\r\n\r\n3. Obstructive Referral to Non-transparent Channels\r\nRedirecting my FOIA request to a separate email creates an unjustified procedural barrier, delaying and obscuring access. FOIA requires agencies to respond promptly and transparently, not to redirect or impose indirect channels that hinder access. CMS\u2019s actions impede my ability to monitor and engage in the FOIA process fully.\r\n\r\n4. Failure to Meet FOIA\u2019s Public Access Requirements (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA exists to facilitate public access to government records. CMS\u2019s denial of accessible formats and unnecessary referral practices runs contrary to FOIA\u2019s goal of transparency, especially for individuals requiring disability accommodations.\r\n\r\nCorrective Actions Demanded\r\nTo address these statutory and procedural violations, I formally demand the following actions to ensure ADA and FOIA compliance:\r\n\r\n1. Direct Processing of FOIA Request with ADA Accommodations\r\nCMS must process my FOIA request (OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844) directly, honoring the following ADA-required accommodations:\r\n\r\nExclusive Email Communication to AabiWR@live.com.\r\nScreen Reader-Compatible PDF Formatting with files labeled by category and date.\r\n2. Comprehensive Search Confirmation Across CMS Divisions and OCR\r\nI request written confirmation that CMS has conducted a thorough and complete search of all records related to ADA compliance and civil rights complaints across all relevant departments, including OSORA and OCR.\r\n\r\n3. Verification of Contacts with Accountability and Oversight\r\nPlease provide the names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisors responsible for this FOIA request. Required individuals include:\r\n\r\nDoris Davis, Government Information Specialist, CMS FOIA Division\r\nKaren Jackson, Deputy Director, OSORA, Division of FOIA Analysis\r\nMary E. Greene, Director, OSORA, CMS\r\n4. Detailed Justification for Withheld or Redacted Records\r\nFor any records withheld or redacted, I require a detailed explanation citing specific FOIA exemptions. Please also include a summary of withheld content to maintain transparency and adhere to ADA requirements.\r\n\r\n5. Immediate Confirmation of ADA-Compliant Procedures\r\nConfirm in writing that CMS will adhere to my ADA-required accommodations in all future responses, specifically exclusive email communication and accessible PDF formatting.\r\n\r\nConclusion and Escalation Notification\r\nCMS\u2019s actions reveal a troubling disregard for both FOIA and ADA standards, impacting individuals with disabilities\u2019 access to public records and agency accountability. If these issues are not promptly resolved through the corrective actions outlined, I will escalate this matter to the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and additional federal oversight bodies.\r\n\r\nI request acknowledgment of this appeal and a timeline for implementing these corrective actions within 20 business days, as required by FOIA.\r\n\r\nThank you for addressing this critical legal matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\nNovember 8, 2024",
