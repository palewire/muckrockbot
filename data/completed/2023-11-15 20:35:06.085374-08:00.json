With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThe City has received your three PRAs (23-454, 23-455, and 23-456).  All three PRAs request the same documents.  Two of the PRAs (23-454 and 23-456) request the same documents from the same departments.  I am going to close PRA 23-456 as it is duplicative.  I am going to add Public Works to PRA 23-454 and close PRA 23-455 as it is duplicative.\r\n\r\nAll three PRAs have sent messages to you via NextRequest regarding these PRAs being over broad and requesting guidance.\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act and related Sunshine Ordinance provisions (\"PRA\") provide timeframes to determine whether a request seeks disclosable records. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.535.)\r\n\r\nThe PRA contains no specific time limits for producing disclosable records. Instead, it requires agencies to provide an estimate of the date the records will be made available. (Ibid.)  This is because the PRA recognizes that governmental operations should not come to halt in order for the public agency to respond to PRA requests, particularly requests for voluminous document sets. (See, e.g., Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 483 [finding that request for production of records of 1990 convention in April and May of 1992 was timely].)\r\n\r\nDue to the City's limited resources, the voluminous number for records responsive to the current PRA, and the current volume of PRA requests, at this time we anticipate that documents responsive to your request will be made available in approximately four (4) months or by February 1, 2024. If the documents become available before then, we will update you at that time.\r\n\r\nShould you narrow your request, the time for production may be reduced.\r\n\r\nThank you, Lisa\r\n\r\nLisa K.

Instructions are attached and  located here https://legacyhelp.fsc.follett.com/content/t_generate_title_copy_list_report.htm. Please include all titles (regardless of status) and include the categories and circulation statistics. \r\n\r\nPlease output the file(s) as Excel.\r\n\r\nIn the event the report is limited by the 10,000 title limit, please split it the catalogue information into multiple groupings as the report allows. For instance you could limit the titles in each file by selecting groupings A-G and H-Z.\r\n\r\nAs censorship is at an all time high, we are conducting research on titles that may be most at risk of censorship across Texas. We hope to assist schools in their mission of maintaining young learners critical access to books in their libraries.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSidney Braveword",

As such, this would not fall under an exemption, as it is not a pre-decision opinion by CMS. Could this redaction be removed? This email is being forwarded by the CMS employee as an \"FYI\".\r\n\r\n2) On page 234 of the PDF, an employee of CMS has received a copy from an outside organization of an article published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology (a journal and article available to the public). The (b)(5) redaction appears to be applied to the employees opinion on the article, not on internal decision making process. As the opinion is being rendered on a public document, and after contact initiated by an outside organization, could this redaction be removed?\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the rest of the release, the other Exemption 5 redactions seem consistent, save for these two.\r\n\r\nAgain, I really appreciate this work. This was a huge number of files!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nControl Number 090820227055 and PIN T3QD",

However, in reviewing your request I do not see a date range in which you are seeking responsive records.  Please let me know what date range you are asking us to search within.  This will allow me to complete the search in a timely fashion.  Additionally, the inclusion of common names (i.e. Karen etc.) is likely to capture numerous communications that may or may not be relevant to your intended request.  To the extent you are able to provide more specific search terms it will aid in processing the request and reduce the volume of unrelated items that are pulled.  Finally, the inclusion of \"Morrisey\" as a search term will result in any emails or communications with the Attorney General's name in signature blocks.  Again, to the extent you are able to provide clarity on the information sought or let me know which search terms should be search in conjunction with each other, rather than each individually, it will aid in processing your request so that we are able to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me at this address or call me at 304-558-1482 to discuss this matter at your convenience.\r\n\r\nOnce I have received the date range, and any other clarification, I will be able to provide you with a date our response will be provided.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n\r\nSteven A.

As per our previous correspondence, I am considering your request fulfilled by the provided closing reports, which were redacted pursuant to FOIL. \r\nThe CCRB closing report does not represent the final agency determination of the Board; it is merely a recommendation by the investigator to the Board. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g)(iii) permits the CCRB to deny access to records that are \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency materials which are not . . . final agency policy or determinations.\u201d\u00a0 Accordingly, we do not disclose CCRB work product, opinions, recommendations, advice, or records which reflect the consultative and deliberative process. Such records were redacted because they do not constitute final agency determinations. \r\nAdditionally, these reports contain information, such as names, addresses, ages, and dates of birth, and other personal identifying information as defined in Public Officers Law \u00a7 89. As a City agency, we are also subject to N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 23-1201 and are required to withhold personal identifying information to the extent permitted under FOIL. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(b) permits the CCRB to deny access to records or information that \u201cif disclosed would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Such personal identifying information has been redacted. \r\nNYS Office of Court Administration records are exempt from FOIL under Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 86(1), 86(3), and 86(4), which define \"judiciary,\" \"agency,\" and \"record\" and state that records from agencies that are identified as judiciary are exempt from FOIL. Additionally, the CCRB has a contract with the Office of Court Administration that conditions our ability to access their records, a necessity for our investigations, on not releasing those records except as proscribed by the contract. So as to not interfere with the contract the CCRB has with the New York State Officer of Court Administration as permitted under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(c) and to comply with the defined terms of FOIL, any information obtained from the search of the Office of Court Administration\u2019s database have been redacted. \r\nOther redactions, such as those based on Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 87(2)(a) (\"specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal statute\u201d), 87(2)(e) (law enforcement and investigative records), 87(2)(f) (life and safety), and 87(4-b) (technical infractions) are noted as applicable within the reports. \r\n \r\nYou may appeal the decision to deny access to material that was redacted in part or withheld in entirety by contacting the agency's FOIL Appeals Officer: foil@ccrb.nyc.gov within 30 days.
