This testimony is not included in the publicly released copy of the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSeveral of the USS Liberty survivors who testified before the Court testified that in their opinion the attack was deliberate. An Associated Press article (June 17, 1967) and an NSA message both cited this. None of this testimony is included in the publicly released copy of the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting a copy of the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report that was submitted by the Court to ADM John S. McCain, Jr. who, as Convening Authority, authorized the US Navy Court of Inquiry. NOT ANOTHER COPY OF THE US NAVY COURT OF INQUIRY REPORT THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoe Meadors",
