Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations",
