Thank you for your prompt response. I really do appreciate the work of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, and if you can, please send them my regards for all the records they've helped unearth.\r\n\r\nIn his response letter dated 19 April 2024, Section Chief Michael G. Seidel wrote that \"we are releasing documents from previous requests regarding your subject. We consider your request fulfilled. Since we relied on previous results, additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist. If this release of previously processed material does not satisfy your request, you may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one particular additional record I would like to request a search for. In 2016, the FBI released something called an \"HVT List\" with the following headers: \"Requester | Total Cases | Total IP Cases | Percent of Total Cases | Percent of Current IP Pending | Submitted Since January | Submitted Within Fiscal Year.\" In 2020, the FBI released a similar list with slightly different headers. You may find copies of both attached.\r\n\r\nIf such a document exists today, please release the most recent version. Thank you again for your efforts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMatthew",

The request sought records related to water quality complaints and issues within the Albany, Schenectady, and Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) from January 1, 2018, to the present. I have not received a response, acknowledgment, or any communication from the Troy Water Department regarding my request. Pursuant to FOIL, the agency is required to respond within five business days.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, my original request sought the following information:\r\n\r\n1) The total number of water quality complaints received by your agency/authority/utility, broken down by year.\r\n2) A detailed summary of each water quality complaint, including the date, location, nature of the complaint, any actions taken, and the resolution or current status.\r\n3) Any reports, memos, or other documentation related to water quality complaints, investigations, and resolutions within the specified area and timeframe.\r\n\r\nI followed up on my original request with two subsequent emails on April 11, 2023, and April 26, 2023, requesting a response or an update on the status of my request. However, I have not received any acknowledgment or response from the Troy Water Department.\r\n\r\nThe summary denial of access to the requested records is in violation of FOIL. I respectfully request that you reconsider my request and provide the requested records or a valid explanation for withholding them within ten business days, as required by FOIL.\r\n\r\nIf my appeal is denied, please provide a written explanation for the denial and inform me of any further appeal procedures available under New York State law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to receiving your response.",

I appreciate your attention to this matter, and I would like to address some of the points you raised in your letter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I understand your concern about the method of submission and tracking of FOIL requests. However, I would like to clarify that my request was submitted through MuckRock, a widely recognized platform used for submitting and tracking FOIL requests. This platform is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and ease of use for both the requestor and the agency. It is not intended to circumvent any established procedures but to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the FOIL process.\r\n\r\nSecondly, regarding the issue of timeliness, I would like to remind you that according to Article 6 (Section 84-90) of the New York State's Freedom of Information Law, an agency is required to respond to a FOIL request within five business days of receipt. If the agency cannot provide the requested records within that timeframe, it must provide a written acknowledgment of receipt and a reasonable date by which the request will be granted or denied. In this case, I have not received such acknowledgment or estimated date.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to reiterate my commitment to working collaboratively with your agency to fulfill this FOIL request. I understand the importance of following proper procedures and am willing to cooperate fully to ensure that this process is carried out in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you reconsider your position and provide the requested records or a reasonable timeline for their provision. I look forward to your prompt response.",

As I read it Section 3-4.2 of the manual describes the circumstances under which mutual aid can be requested / accepted, and the rules for doing so. \r\n\r\nBut my request sought a record reflecting the process described in this manual actually happening: \r\n\r\n\u201cA copy of any Memorandum of Understanding, Memorandum of Agreement, Mutual Aid Agreement, or other, similar document allowing the Atlanta Police Department to exercise police power outside the City of Atlanta's territorial jurisdiction in unincorporated Dekalb County.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo narrow a bit, let\u2019s focus on the property surrounding Key Road, Constitution, and Bouldercrest, where APD is currently exercising police power. Is there a memo of understanding for that exercise between DKPD and APD? If so, that\u2019s what I thought I was requesting. Happy to file a new request and close this one out if it\u2019s easier, but it also seems like a list of standing agreements reflecting the decisions laid out in 3-4.2 is a record DKPS would have that would be responsive to my original request. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! \r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAndrew Free\r\n                ",

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to move forward with reducing the scope of your request.  If you do reduce the scope of your request, you are welcome to request additional material once your release has been made.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\nCOVID-19 Impact: The Records Information/Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating at reduced staffing levels amidst the ongoing COVID-19 national emergency.

Accordingly, your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request by ten additional days, as permitted by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. \r\n\r\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  Your request was assigned to the Simple track.  It was placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing.  Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-00802.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request. \r\n\r\nBecause this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of FOIA requests at this time, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nGinae E.

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a broad interpretation of FOIA to ensure disclosure of government information.\r\nThe D.C. Circuit in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998), held that non-commercial requesters should not bear the full cost of FOIA processing, supporting my request for a fee waiver.\r\nIn Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Court recognized the public interest in understanding government activities, underscoring the importance of the requested information.\r\nFee Waiver Justification:\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The Supreme Court, in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, affirmed the public interest standard for fee waivers. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it contributes significantly to understanding the FBI's handling of FOIA requests, particularly from prolific or high-profile requesters. This request is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Appeal Process:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A), I expect a response to this request within 20 business days. In case of a denial or partial denial, I request a detailed justification, citing specific exemptions as established in Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your compliance within the stipulated timeframe, as mandated by FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\nFee Waiver Request Letter\r\nScreenshot of the KTLA Article for Reference\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), the Supreme Court\r\n    emphasized the importance of a broad interpretation of FOIA to ensure\r\n    disclosure of government information.\r\n    The D.C. Circuit in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34\r\n    F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998), held that non-commercial requesters should not\r\n    bear the full cost of FOIA processing, supporting my request for a fee\r\n    waiver.\r\n    In Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,\r\n    489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Court recognized the public interest in\r\n    understanding government activities, underscoring the importance of the\r\n    requested information.\r\n    Fee Waiver Justification:\r\n    \r\n    I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request.

The FBI cited exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) of the FOIA, which concern unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. I respectfully contest this decision on the following grounds, supported by relevant case law and precedent:\r\n\r\n    Public Interest and Case Law: The Supreme Court in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), emphasized that FOIA\u2019s central purpose is to ensure an informed citizenry, vital for the functioning of a democratic society. This decision underscores the importance of transparency and public access to government records.\r\n\r\n    Balancing Test for Privacy Concerns: In National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the requester must show that the public interest sought is significant and that the information is likely to advance that interest. In this case, the information requested is critical for understanding the FBI's procedures in handling FOIA requests, which is of substantial public interest.\r\n\r\n    Limited Scope of Request: The request does not seek sensitive personal details but focuses on the procedural handling of requests. U.S. Department of Defense v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487 (1994) supports the argument that the release of information primarily concerning government operations does not typically impinge on personal privacy.\r\n\r\n    Precedent for Disclosure: Similar information was released by the FBI in 2017, as evidenced by MuckRock News (https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/mar/10/fbis-2016-vexsome-filer-list-whos-who-foia/). This sets a precedent for disclosing such information, aligning with the principles of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nIn light of the case law cited and the precedent set by previous disclosures, I respectfully request that the Office of Information Policy re-evaluate the decision to deny my FOIA request and consider releasing the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your response and hope for a decision that upholds the principles of transparency and accountability central to FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

I appreciate your continued attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nUpon review of your notification and the accompanying explanation of exemptions, I wish to address the concerns raised and provide the necessary clarification to ensure the timely and accurate processing of my appeal.\r\n\r\nExemption Application: I acknowledge the exemptions cited under Subsections of Title 5, United States Code, Section 552. However, I contend that the information requested falls outside the scope of these exemptions, particularly (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). My appeal centers on records pertinent to the procedural handling of FOIA requests from prolific and high-profile individuals or entities, which primarily involve government operations rather than personal matters. As established by relevant case law, the disclosure of such information serves the public interest by fostering transparency and accountability within government agencies.\r\n\r\nIn Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press v. FBI, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Supreme Court emphasized the fundamental purpose of FOIA to ensure transparency in government activities, underscoring the public interest in accessing information.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), the Court highlighted the importance of a broad interpretation of FOIA to facilitate the disclosure of government information.\r\n\r\nPrecedent and Public Interest: The Supreme Court's interpretation of FOIA in Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press underscores the importance of public access to government records to ensure an informed citizenry. Moreover, the release of similar information by the FBI in the past, as evidenced by the MuckRock News article, establishes a precedent for disclosing records related to FOIA requesters. Given these precedents and the significant public interest in understanding government procedures, I respectfully request reconsideration of my appeal.\r\n\r\nFOIA Addendum and Standard Search Policy: I acknowledge the information provided regarding the FBI FOIPA Addendum and standard search policy. I assure you that my request aligns with the standard search criteria outlined and does not seek records falling under exemptions related to intelligence sources, methods, or activities.\r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, I kindly request that the fix required for my FOIA appeal be addressed promptly to facilitate the resolution of this matter. Should any further clarification or documentation be necessary, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of (U//FOUO) Anarchist Extremists Likely to Exploit 01 May Events for\r\n    Violent Activity\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the response to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request regarding Black Lives Matter, FOIPA Request No.: 1589047-000. I am requesting that the FBI conduct a more thorough search and provide all responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn my initial request, I provided specific key terms and reference points to narrow down the search, yet the response I received stated that there was no attempt made to search for responsive records. This leads me to believe that the search was inadequate in whole, and I request that the FBI conduct a more comprehensive search.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to request an interagency search for any responsive records that may be held by other agencies. As stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(C), agencies are required to make reasonable efforts to search for records that are requested, even if the records are not located within the agency. Given the importance and significance of the Black Lives Matter movement, I believe it is reasonable to assume that other agencies may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn support of my appeal, I would like to cite the case law of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Executive Office of the President, 658 F. Supp. 2d 217, 225 (D.D.C. 2009), which held that agencies must conduct a search that is reasonably calculated to uncover all responsive documents, rather than a search that is cursory or in bad faith. Additionally, I would like to cite the legal principle of agency discretion, which provides that agencies must conduct their searches in good faith and with due diligence.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will reconsider your response to my FOIA request and conduct a more thorough search for responsive records. If you have any questions or require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,",

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.
