Electronic communications (FD-1057 forms)\r\n2. Incident data and summaries\r\n3. Investigation narratives and interview synopses (FD-302 forms)\r\n4. Collected item and evidence entry logs (FD-1087 forms)\r\n5. Tips, leads, investigative reports, and documents shared with the FBI by other law enforcement agencies and individuals (FD-1036, titled \u201cImport Forms\u201d)\r\n6. Laboratory examination requests (FD-1121 forms)\r\n7. Search warrant affidavits and applications\r\n8. Signed search warrants\r\n9. Search warrant execution logs\r\n10. Property receipts (FD-597 forms)\r\n11. Evidence collected item logs (FD-886 forms)\r\n12. Photographic logs (FD-674 forms)\r\n13. Presumptive test logs\r\n\r\nAbby and Libby were found murdered near the Monon High Bridge in Delphi, Carroll County, Indiana, on February 14, 2017. On November 11, 2024, Richard Allen was convicted of these murders and sentenced to 130 years in prison. \r\n\r\nRelevant media releases can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_mTpaRs-0n_oNGGezgkxsY6WD5WeRSvg\r\n\r\nCourt documents regarding the State of Indiana\u2019s case against Richard M. Allen can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/111qXoXAw9YJ_8b3KV0EsEIeiYmOHeuH1\r\n\r\nPlease note that Ronald E. Logan, who was investigated as a person of interest in 2017, passed away on January 24, 2022. As such, he no longer has personal privacy interests protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. See attached document titled \u201c20220302_Ron_Logan_Public_Notice.pdf\u201d for proof of death.\r\n\r\nI would also like to request expedited processing of this request. The FBI may grant expedited processing when the request concerns a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest, which may raise questions about the government's integrity and affect public confidence (see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(iii), (iv) (2014)). \r\n\r\nFor a significant portion of the interested public, the investigation and subsequent conviction of Richard Allen did not instill confidence. The government\u2019s integrity is at stake. To increase transparency and restore public confidence, I intend to disseminate the requested records to a large audience in their original form, without restriction. \r\n\r\nIf previously released records are available, I request a rolling release of those records while additional records are located and processed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarl McGehee",

A summary was provided in  a 1971 Domestic Intelligence Division inspection report: \u201cBANPOP is the code name for a program initiated in August, 1966, in an attempt to identify illegals in the U. S. who may be receiving funds through Swiss banks. The basis for the program was an analysis of four Soviet illegal cases between 1955 and 1966 in which the Banque Populaire Swisse of Switzerland was used by the Soviets to fund illegals. The transfers are screened with the following criteria: (1) the person or individual beneficiary is named; (2) the amount of the transfer is between $300 and $5000 and (3) the last name of the person ordering and receiving is the same of of the money and is directed to a specific bank account.\u201d (https://archive.org/details/FBI-Church-Committee-File/62-116395-441-475/page/4/mode/2up, https://archive.org/details/FBI-Church-Committee-File/62-116395-586-Bulky2/page/126/mode/2up) This is to include file 65-HQ-70741 and any associated bulky files, sub-files, and enclosures behind file.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
