Sai: \nThis notice acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) received on 10/22/2024.  Please use the following unique FOIA tracking number CBP-FO-2025-011200 to track the status of your request.  If you have not already done so, you must create a SecureRelease account. This is the only method available to check the status of your pending FOIA request. \n\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you. \nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \n\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.  We truly appreciate your continued patience. \nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Specifically, you requested 1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024. (Date Range for Record Search: From 10/18/2024 To 10/19/2024). FOIA Specialist our request has been assigned to Jaime Carey, FOIA Specialist.\u00a0 You may contact Jaime Carey\u00a0by email at jacarey@usaid.gov . \u00a0Please reference the tracking number cited above in any future correspondence. Extending the FOIA\u2019s Time Limits due to Unusual Circumstances The FOIA provides that an agency \u00a0may extend its time limits when \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d occur\u00a0in the processing of a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i) (2016).  Those \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d are set forth in the statute, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and are described as: 1) The need to search for records from field facilities or other locations separate from the office processing the request; 2) The need to search, collect and examine voluminous records; and 3) The need for consultation with another agency. Based upon the records you have requested, we have determined that one or more unusual circumstances will occur during the processing of your request.  Accordingly, your response time-limit has been extended beyond the 20 days required by statute; therefore, 10 additional processing days have been added to your request. To mitigate this action, you may limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed more quickly or to arrange an alternative time to respond. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact the assigned FOIA Specialist noted above. You may also contact USAID\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Christopher Colbow, at foia@usaid.gov (mailto:foia@usaid.gov) . \nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services offered: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Telephone: 202-741-5770; Toll Free: 1-877-684-6448 Fax: 202-741-5769 Thank you for your interest in USAID.
