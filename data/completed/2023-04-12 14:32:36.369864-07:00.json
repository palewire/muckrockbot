With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.  On November 14, 2022, the District received the following public records request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2021 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n3. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2020. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n4. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2020 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2020.\r\n\r\n5. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2019. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n6. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2019 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges receiving your request.  The District has assigned this request the number R000176-111622. Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nThen on November 15, 2022, the District received another records request from you.  In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges receiving this request.  The District has assigned it the number R000177-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAgain, the District is currently working on providing you with all responsive records to your original request. Richland School District Policy 4040 \u2013 Public Records Request provides in part, \u201cWhen the same requester simultaneously submits multiple, separate requests or makes one or more additional requests when previous requests are open, the District may queue the requests in the order in which they were received. The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.  Within twenty working days after the District completes request # R000001-020722, it will provide you with the first installment of responsive records to request #R000175-111622. Then within twenty workings days after the District provides you with all responsive records to request ##R000175-111622, the District will provide you with the first installment of the responsive records to request #R000176-111622. And within twenty working days following completing request ##R000176-111622,the District will provide you with the first installment of request #R000177-111622. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGalt L.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Good Morning:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District received your records request on November 16th.  The District acknowledged the request on November 17th.  At the time, the District believed your request to be from an organization named Muckrock.  As previously explained, the District had received several requests from Muckrock.  As such, the District was answering the requests in the order that they were received.  The District now understands that you are an individual making a public records request through the Muckrock platform.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the mistake and is prioritizing your request.  You requested the following public records:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nI have asked the Student Services Department to provide me with the records that answer the first section of your request. I should have those records in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.  The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.  I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.  This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement.\r\n\r\nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.  The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request.\r\n\r\nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.  I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.  Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.  His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.  The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.

Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order. \n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order. \n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order. \nI have asked the Student Services Department to provide me with the records that answer the first section of your request. I should have those records in the next ten working days. \nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.\u00a0 The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.\u00a0 I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.\u00a0 This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement. \nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.\u00a0 The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request. \nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years. \nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.\u00a0 I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days. \nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.\u00a0 Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.\u00a0 His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.\u00a0 The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.\u00a0 His work e-mail address is Jason Crouch RHSSecure@rsd.edu. (mailto:RHSSecure@rsd.edu) \nRick Kane is the SRO assigned to Hanford High School. Hanford High School\u2019s address is 450 Hanford Street, Richland Washington, 99354. His work telephone number is 509-967-6521. Officer Kane\u2019s work e-mail address is Rick Kane HHSSecure@rsd.edu.

We are prioritizing your request and will be providing you with installments of responsive records. Richland School District has identified and located records responsive to your request.\u00a0 The first installment to your public records request is now available.\u00a0 Please log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The Sherriff\u2019s Office provided me with the incident number 2107220284/case number 21015344 and incident number 2301220136/case number 23001556. If you have any additional case numbers or information, let me know.\r\n\r\nFirst we have to see from the law enforcement agency if we are authorized to release the audio. If we are authorized to release it, we will have your request done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by Florida State Statute Section 365.171(12)(a) and 401.30 to redact certain information from 911 calls. Section 365.171(12)(a), F.S., provides that any record, recording, or information, or portions thereof, obtained by a public agency for the purpose of providing services in an emergency which reveals the name, address, or telephone number or personal information about, or information which may identify any person requesting emergency service or reporting an emergency by accessing an emergency communications E911 system is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), F.S.  Additionally, under 401.30, records of emergency calls which contain patient examination or treatment information are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and may not be disclosed without the consent of the person to whom they pertain, but appropriate limited disclosure may be made without such consent to the person\u2019s guardian, to the next of kin if the person is deceased, or to a parent if the person is a minor.\r\n\r\nOnce your request is complete, we could email over an invoice. You could be charged for labor at a rate of $29.94 an hour if the request takes longer than 30 minutes to pull the audio. We will let you know if it reaches that point. As long as the audio is redacted, the audio file is small enough to be attached to an email and there isn't a labor charge we must receive payment for first, we can send it over email as soon as your request is complete, free of charge. If you prefer the audio be burnt onto a CD, the cost will be $0.30 for the CD and $1.76 for postage if mailed. We accept cash and checks.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa\n",

You have submitted twenty-six separate petitions to the Supervisor of Records and numerous other follow up communications concerning prior petitions. We have already responded to eighteen of your petitions.\r\n\r\nDue to the volume of petitions and the complexity of the issues raised, we are continuing to invoke the rule of reason and will respond to your petitions within a reasonable time period with the goal of addressing each petition within 30 days of submission. We understand you disagree with this basis. As we recently explained in response to one of your complaints with the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force, we strive to respond to petitions within the 10-day period specified in Section 67.21(d), but we don't view it as an absolute deadline. Particularly here, where the issues raised are novel and you have submitted numerous petitions over a short time period, responding within 10 days is not feasible because doing so would unreasonably impinge on our ability to perform our other responsibilities.

Your response is required by Feb 11, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).  Emails are requested in the easily-generated EML or MSG formats (SFAC 67.21(l)).\r\n\r\nI am now auditing how the City appears to unlawfully withhold the BCC recipients of emails when they print out emails in certain formats.  The identity of BCC recipients is not exempt.  BCC is not an information security record that reveals vulnerabilities or increases chance of an attack.  The BCC names was typed in by a human being and are not metadata.  You must provide BCC just like you provide To or CC recipients.  There is no legal authority to keep secret the identities of persons communicating with government officials, unless they are specifically confidential informants and such.  If you withhold the BCC names, I will file complaints, separate and apart from email metadata complaints (which I have now already won, see ruling in SOTF 19044).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations: All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27). All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.  \r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\n1. An exact copy with all email headers (incl. but not limited to the BCC identities), attachments, color, formatting, hyperlinks, images, and all other parts of the record of the most recent 5 emails which have any BCC recipients which were sent by your Dept Head on any government account . Note that you will have to search directly from the person's computer or account in their Sent folder specifically (In many email systems, no other method will allow you to see the BCC recipients).  In modern Outlook systems, the search query is as follows: (bcc:*)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses.

        "communication": "Sheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department:\r\n\r\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars.  See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 .  On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that \r\n\r\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott.  If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation.\r\n\r\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive).\r\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning.  Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested.  Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office):  https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf \r\n\r\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt.  Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified.  You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety.  Please ensure you actually do your duty.\r\n\r\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time:\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted.   You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence.  They are *his* calendars.   And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part.  First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror.  Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations.  You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter.\r\n\r\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt).  You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

        "communication": "Sheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department:\r\n\r\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars. See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 . On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that\r\n\r\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott. If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation.\r\n\r\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive).\r\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning. Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested. Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office): https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf\r\n\r\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt. Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified. You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety. Please ensure you actually do your duty.\r\n\r\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time:\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted. You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence. They are *his* calendars. And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part. First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror. Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations. You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter.\r\n\r\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt). You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \n\n \nRE: Public Records Request of September 23, 2020, Reference # P000054-092420 \nDear Anonymous, \nThis email follows up the message sent to you on October 26, 2020. The Sheriff's Office will provide records to you on November 5, 2020. \nYour request received on September 23, 2020, was as follows: <sfso.foia@sfgov.org>September 23, 2020 \n\nThis is a follow up to request number SOTF 19143: \n\nSheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department: \n\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request. \n\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars. See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 . On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that \n\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott. If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation. \n\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready. \n\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive). \n\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning. Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested. Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office): https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf \n\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt. Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified. You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety. Please ensure you actually do your duty. \n\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time: \n\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted. You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters. \n\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record. \n\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence. They are *his* calendars. And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names. \n\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure. \n\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part. First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror. Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations. You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter. \n\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt). You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616 \n\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose. \n\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure. \n\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

(The other five were Edwin Edwards, George Wallace, Jim Hunt, Bill Janklow, and Terry Branstad.) Rhodes is tied for the fourth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. As governor in 1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University campus at the request of Kent, Ohio's mayor, after the ROTC building was burned down by unknown arsonists on May 2. On May 4, four students were killed and nine others were wounded by the Guard. One victim, Dean Kahler, suffered permanent paralysis. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not required, as the subject was born over 100 years ago.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Rhodes is tied for the fourth longest gubernatorial\r\n    tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. As governor in\r\n    1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University\r\n    campus at the request of Kent, Ohio's mayor, after the ROTC building was\r\n    burned down by unknown arsonists on May 2. On May 4, four students were\r\n    killed and nine others were wounded by the Guard. One victim, Dean Kahler,\r\n    suffered permanent paralysis.\r\n    \r\n    Proof of death is not required, as the subject was born over 100 years ago.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma Best\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation\n",

The case is a matter of public interest given that the case has been unresolved at the moment, without a suspect in custody, and the case is under investigation. That said, I would request a rolling release of materials if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdwin Rios",

The following constraints limit this FOIA request:\r\n\r\n3.1. Only specific agency documents are requested for each IED/EFP attack, including:\r\n3.1.1. Combined Information Data Network Exchange (\"CIDNE\") Significant Activity (\"SIGACT\") report(s);\r\n3.1.2. CIDNE Improvised Explosive Device (\"IED\") report(s);\r\n3.1.3. Medical Evacuation (\"MEDEVAC\") Nine\u2013Line transcript(s);\r\n3.1.4. MEDEVAC Assault Support Request(s) (\"ASR\");\r\n3.1.5. Composite Timeline report(s);\r\n3.1.6. Explosive Ordinance Disposal (\"EOD\")/Combined Explosives Exploitation Cell (\"CEXC\") storyboard report(s);\r\n3.1.7. Serious Incident Report(s) (\"SIR\");\r\n3.1.8. Weapons Intelligence Team (\"WIT\") report(s);\r\n3.1.9. Intelligence Directorate (\"C2\") Operations Watch Highlights report(s);\r\n3.1.10. IED Post Patrol Debrief (\u201c64\u2013Liner\u201d) report(s);\r\n3.1.11. Battle Damage Assessment (\u201cBDA\u201d) reports(s);\r\n3.1.12. Multi National Division (\"MND\")/Multi National Corps\u2013Iraq (\"MNC\u2013I\") IED/EFP Update report(s);\r\n3.1.13. Multi National Force\u2013Iraq (\"MNF\u2013I\") Battle Update Assessment(s) (\"BUA\") briefing slides;\r\n3.1.14. AR 15\u20136 Investigation report(s) and/or Command Directed Investigation (\u201cCDI\u201d) report(s);\r\n3.1.15. Hospital casualty update report(s);\r\n3.1.16. Defense Casualty Information Processing System\u2013Forward (\"DCIPS\u2013CF\") report(s).\r\n\r\n3.2. Excluding any documents containing the agency\u2019s deliberative material or recommendations;\r\n3.3. Excluding any documents classified Top Secret (\u201cTS\u201d), Sensitive Compartmented Information (\u201cSCI\u201d), and/or Special Access Program (\u201cSAP\u201d); however,\r\n3.4. Including all of the agency\u2019s responsive documents that are classified below the TS, SCI and/or SAP levels; for example, any documents marked Unclassified (\u201cU\u201d), Sensitive But Unclassified (\u201cSBU\u201d), For Official Use Only (\u201cFOUO\u201d), Confidential (\u201cC\u201d), Law Enforcement Sensitive (\u201cLES\u201d), and/or Secret (\u201cS\u201d).\r\n\r\n4. Although FOIA has always presumed that government records are open to public inspection, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-185, prohibits agencies from withholding records unless (1) \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law\u201d or (2) \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by\u201d one of FOIA\u2019s exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A). Thus, in addition to FOIA favoring disclosure and requiring its exemptions to be narrowly construed, Section 552(a)(8)(A) prohibits agencies from using their discretion to broadly withhold records merely because they believe an exemption could technically apply.\r\n\r\n5. In order to expedite the agency\u2019s release of the requested documents, please disclose them on an interim, rolling basis as they become available; for example, without waiting for all of the agency\u2019s relevant systems of record to be searched, or all of its relevant records to be processed. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\n6. If the agency\u2019s processing costs for this request exceed $350.00, please notify me in advance so that I might consider paying any additional fees for a complete and accurate set of responsive documents. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n7. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Scantling",

A delay was incurred because of our current Command posture regarding COVID\u201019.  On 31 January 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.  On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization publicly characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.    Then on 17 March 2020, Office of Management and Budget offered more stringent guidance stating, \u201c[i]n order to achieve this posture [social distancing], consistent with The President's Coronavirus Guidelines for America, the Government must immediately adjust operations and services to minimize face-to-face interactions\u2026.\u201d  .  USCENTCOM has implemented these guidelines to protect its employees and their communities, and to ensure that it can continue to protect the United States during this national emergency.  Specifically, USCENTCOM leadership issued guidance requiring any employees who can telework must do so.  Telework is not available for FOIA employees, therefore the processing of your FOIA request may be delayed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFOIA 17-0547 is currently #129 in the USCENTCOM FOIA queue.  In the meanwhile, you may track all your open requests on the queue report on our website at: https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/statusreport/foia_status_report.pdf.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMr. Steven Johnson\r\n\r\nUSCENTCOM FOIA Requester Service Center\r\n\r\n(813) 529-6285",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.

        "communication": "Rebecca Williams,\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore City Department of Finance (\u201cDOF\u201d) is in receipt of your records request below. This request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), codified in Sections 4-101 et seq. of the General Provisions Article of the Maryland Code. A request for public information under the PIA must be submitted to the custodian of public records. Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-202(a). Each governmental entity is the custodian of its own records. See Baltimore City Code, Art. 1 \u00a7 10-1. This response is on behalf of DOF.\r\n\r\nThe search for the documents you have requested and their review may take more than 10-days due to the volume of documentation you requested and the fact that many City personnel are teleworking with limited access to hard copies of responsive files. Once the documents are gathered, we will then know the volume of the responsive documentation.  The PIA allows the government to charge for any time past two hours that it takes to gather, review and redact, if necessary, any documents requested at the rate of the employee performing the work after giving the first two hours labor for free.  Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-206; accord Md. Public Information Act Compliance Board Opinion 16-05. If there are a substantial number of documents to review that will take us more than two hours, we will let you know of the cost and where to send payment, which is required before any documents will be reviewed. See, e.g., Ireland v. Shearin, 417 Md. 401, n. 412, n.8 (2010).\r\n\r\nWe will let you know as soon as the documents are gathered if there will be any charges associated with your request.\r\n\r\nNothing in this response is intended to indicate that any records sought from City agencies exist or to waive any privileges held by the Mayor and City Council.  You may contest this response by filing a complaint in Circuit Court pursuant to PIA Section \u00a7 4-362.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9502E.96BA26C0]<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baltimorecity.gov%2F&data=05%7C01%7CAhleah.Knapp%40baltimorecity.gov%7C7b1e63fb066144740d8f08db1e6fa302%7C312cb126c6ae4fc2800d318e679ce6c7%7C0%7C0%7C638137237075316902%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mn0tnOouLIdsQApN0rsJczmvosLIWQalaesaMh8rWqQ%3D&reserved=0>\r\nDepartment of Law\r\nAhleah Knapp\r\nLegal Specialist\r\nAdvice & Opinions Practice Group\r\nBaltimore City Department of Law\r\n100 N.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",
