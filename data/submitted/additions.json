United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971): The Supreme Court recognized the need for government transparency and accountability, especially when matters of public concern are involved.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to draw your attention to a tweet posted by former President Donald Trump on October 6, 2020, in which he refers to the declaration or declassification of certain documents related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. For your reference, I have attached a screenshot of the tweet to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
