Specifically, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nA log/database of all ALPR reads, including whether the read resulted in a hit/alarm, whether the hit/alarm was accepted, which hotlist(s) the hit/alarm corresponded to, whether the hit/alarm resulted in a vehicle stop, and whether the stop resulted in a citation, arrest or other action.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\nMatter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Police Department, 139 Misc. 2d 893 (Sup. Ct. 1988): This case established that records created by ALPRs are subject to disclosure under the New York Freedom of Information Law.\r\nMatter of Fappiano v. New York City Police Department, 95 A.D.3d 923 (2d Dept. 2012): This case involved a request for records relating to the NYPD's use of ALPRs. The court held that the NYPD must disclose records related to its use of ALPRs under FOIL, including records related to the purchase, maintenance, and operation of the ALPRs.\r\nMatter of New York Civil Liberties Union v. City of New York Police Department, 18 N.Y.3d 147 (2011): This case involved a request for records related to the NYPD's use of ALPRs. The court held that records related to the NYPD's use of ALPRs are subject to disclosure under FOIL, including records related to the purchase, maintenance, and operation of the ALPRs.\r\nPlease note that if any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I reserve the right to seek legal remedies, including a court order compelling the production of the records. The New York State Courts have consistently held that the public has a right to access government records, including those created and maintained by law enforcement agencies, subject to limited exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Every pilot must make this final check to ensure the general integrity of their aircraft. Here\u2019s a brief overview:\r\n\r\n\r\nCabin Inspection\r\nThe first step, check that you have the require paperwork. The acronym ARROW can help you remember the five documents you need to bring:\r\n\r\nAirworthiness Certificate\r\nRegistration Certificate\r\nRadio Station License (only required for operations outside the U.S.)\r\nOperating Handbook\r\nWeight and Balance Data\r\nLegally, these documents and certificates must be inside the aircraft, and the airworthiness certificate needs to be on display where passengers can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second step:\r\n\r\nMake sure the cockpit switches and valve toggles are in the right position.\r\nSwitch the battery on and record fuel gauge readings  to compare to your visual inspection later.\r\nTurn off the battery and make sure the magnetos are off.\r\nClean the cockpit of all trash and any unsecured tools and make sure your seatbelts aren\u2019t fraying or loose.\r\nIf your plane has fuses, find the location and number of spares.\r\nExterior Inspection\r\nAll pilots should do a walk-around of their aircraft before a flight even if it was recently serviced and approved, it is always a good idea to double check all components. Pre-flight inspections ensure nothing is damaged or overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Third step :\r\n\r\nLook for loose rivets, bolts, nuts and safety-wired devices and any residue around these items.\r\nCheck brake pads and discs for thickness and look for rust and grooves.\r\nCheck tires for wear and flats by rolling the plane forward and backward.\r\nCheck oleo struts for proper inflation.\r\nTest rigged controls for free movement with no chafing  don\u2019t forget to remove the control lock.\r\nMake sure control hinge fasteners are secure.\r\nCheck the propeller for oil leaks, significant damage and loose blades.\r\nInspect the engine check oil levels and make sure air intakes are free of debris.\r\nCheck the exhaust pipe  make sure it\u2019s free of oil and black buildup.\r\nFuel system Check the fuel quantity and compare to cockpit gauges, look for correct octane color and debris and make sure fuel vents aren\u2019t obstructed.\r\nDrain sumps and sample fuel  be sure fuel doesn\u2019t keep dripping after.\r\nClean your windows, inside and out.\r\nReview your aircraft\u2019s performance data and emergency procedures.\r\nOnce you complete a thorough preflight inspection, you can take to the air with confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: PreFlight pilot checklist\r\n\r\n1.

For example, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (2019), the court ruled that the government could not withhold or redact records related to the CIA's use of drone strikes. Additionally, in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy (2020), the court ruled that the government must release certain records related to climate change policy.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to the following records:\r\n\r\nArchitectural drawings and blueprints of The Cadet Chapel, including any revisions or updates made over the past 10 years.\r\nRecords related to the construction and maintenance of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any contracts or agreements with contractors and vendors.\r\nRecords related to the funding of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any budget reports or financial statements.\r\nAny records related to events or ceremonies held at The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including guest lists, program materials, and photographs.\r\nTo facilitate your search for the requested documents, please let me know if there are any specific offices or departments that may hold the requested documents.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you do not redact, withhold, or delete any responsive records. If any documents are withheld or redacted, I will seek a court order to compel their release. Please note that the government's obligation to disclose records under FOIA is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, and I urge you to fully comply with my request.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make a special request for any records related to the history and significance of The Cadet Chapel at West Point. As a landmark building with a rich history, I am interested in learning more about the cultural and historical significance of The Cadet Chapel, and any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Because when it comes to driving, it's not just about getting from point A to point B, it's about feeling the family connection (if you know what I mean).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting all documents, emails, and memos related to the processing time of driver's license applications and registration documents for the past five years. Because when you're part of the family, you want to make sure that everyone is taken care of (even if it means waiting in line for what feels like forever).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request any statistics or reports on the number of people who have fallen asleep while waiting in line at any of the NY DMV offices during the past five years. Because we all know that sometimes, waiting in line can feel like spending quality time with your second cousin twice removed (you know, the one who always falls asleep at family gatherings).\r\n\r\nIf possible, please include any information on the measures taken by the DMV to address long wait times and to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals waiting in line. Because we're all part of the same family here, and we want to make sure that everyone is treated with respect and care.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the importance of efficiency and accuracy in processing these requests, I couldn't help but wonder if any of your employees have ever felt the need for speed, so to speak. Any reports or records related to any high-speed pursuits, street racing incidents, or other dangerous activities involving DMV employees would be greatly appreciated (but we won't tell anyone, because family always sticks together).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo obtain documents related to the Occupy Wall Street protest that took place in New York City between September 17, 2011, and November 15, 2011. Specifically, I am requesting documents related to surveillance of the protest and any other relevant documents.\r\n\r\n***Please read this request carefully. Failure to comply with the request or provide all responsive records in a timely manner may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Mayor's Office, as well as seeking relief in court to compel the production of the responsive records.***\r\n\r\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests took place at various locations throughout New York City, including but not limited to Zuccotti Park (located in the Financial District), Foley Square (located in Lower Manhattan), Union Square (located in the East Village), Washington Square Park (located in Greenwich Village), Tompkins Square Park (located in the East Village), Bryant Park (located in Midtown Manhattan), City Hall Park (located in Lower Manhattan), Columbus Circle (located at the southwest corner of Central Park), Brooklyn Bridge (a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn), Times Square (located in Midtown Manhattan), and Grand Central Terminal (located in Midtown Manhattan).\r\n\r\nDuring this time, there were reports of excessive police force and other misconduct towards protestors by NYPD officers. As such, I request access to any and all records related to surveillance of the protests at these locations, including but not limited to, intelligence gathering, information sharing with other law enforcement agencies, and reports on any protest-related incidents. Additionally, I request documents related to the following specific events that took place at these locations:\r\n\r\nZuccotti Park: The initial encampment and general assembly of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\r\nFoley Square: The October 1, 2011, march and rally led by labor unions and community groups in support of Occupy Wall Street.\r\nUnion Square: The September 24, 2011, rally that was one of the largest protests during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\r\nWashington Square Park: The October 8, 2011, student-led rally in support of Occupy Wall Street.\r\nTompkins Square Park: The October 22, 2011, Occupy Halloween march and rally.\r\nBryant Park: The November 3, 2011, Bank Transfer Day protest.\r\nCity Hall Park: The November 15, 2011, eviction of the Occupy Wall Street encampment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am requesting access to any other relevant documents, including but not limited to, communications between NYPD personnel or with other agencies, memos, policies, procedures, training materials, and guidelines related to the surveillance of the protests. This request includes records that may have been generated by interagency collaboration or cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I request any video footage that may have been taken by NYPD Community Affairs officers during the Occupy Wall Street protests. Furthermore, I request access to any complaints filed against NYPD officers during the Occupy Wall Street protests that are related to their conduct towards protestors.\r\n\r\nI understand that locating responsive records may require the use of certain keywords and phrases. Therefore, I suggest that the following key strings be used in the search for responsive records:\r\n\r\nOccupy Wall Street\r\nOWS\r\nZuccotti Park\r\nFoley Square\r\nUnion Square\r\nWashington Square Park\r\nTompkins Square Park\r\nBryant Park\r\nCity Hall Park\r\nColumbus Circle\r\nBrooklyn Bridge\r\nTimes Square\r\nGrand Central Terminal\r\nCommunity Affairs\r\nComplaints\r\nSurveillance\r\nIntelligence gathering\r\nInformation sharing\r\nReports\r\nMemos\r\nPolicies\r\nProcedures\r\nTraining materials\r\nGuidelines\r\nI request that all responsive records be provided without redactions or deletions, unless a specific legal exemption applies. If records are withheld or redacted, I request that the basis for withholding or redaction be clearly stated, and that any segregable portions of the records be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request that the responsive documents be provided to me on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than waiting until all records have been compiled. This will enable me to more quickly review and analyze the records, as well as identify any additional documents that may be necessary to request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIL mandates that records be provided to the public, and withholding or redacting responsive records may only be done under specific legal exemptions. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, please provide the legal justification for doing so. Failure to comply with this request may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Mayor's Office, as well as seeking relief in court to compel the production of the responsive records.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to cite the following court cases and local laws to support my FOIA request:\r\n\r\nMatter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York, 735 N.Y.S.2d 380 (Sup. Ct. 2001)\r\nMatter of Daily News, L.P. v. New York City Police Dept., 15 N.Y.3d 385, 911 N.E.2d 1140 (2010)\r\nMatter of Murray v. City of New York, 107 A.D.3d 785, 967 N.Y.S.2d 462 (2d Dep't 2013)\r\nNew York Public Officers Law, Article 6\r\n\r\nThese cases and laws establish that FOIL requires government agencies to provide requested records unless they fall under specific exemptions, and that the exemptions must be narrowly construed. Therefore, I urge the NYPD to comply with my FOIA request and provide all responsive records in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequest access to any and all records related to the WWE plane incident and investigation into it, which occurred on May 5, 2002. The incident involved several wrestlers and staff members of the WWE who were traveling on a chartered flight from London to the United States.\r\n\r\nAs you may be aware, the incident became chaotic and resulted in allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and other inappropriate behavior. These allegations were made public in a recent \"Dark Side of the Ring\" documentary by Vice, which has raised serious concerns about the safety and well-being of those involved. I have attached a copy of this article to this request for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned citizen and journalist, I believe it is important to understand the full extent of this incident and any related investigations that may have taken place. Therefore, I request access to any and all records related to this incident, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny FBI investigation or inquiry into the incident\r\nWitness statements and interviews conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies\r\nCorrespondence between the FBI and the WWE or its employees regarding the incident\r\nAny reports or memoranda created as a result of the investigation\r\nAny other documents or information related to the incident or any subsequent investigations\r\nAny other incidents involving the WWE/WWF and allegations of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior\r\nAny other investigations conducted by the FBI into the WWE/WWF or its employees\r\nIn addition, I request that the FBI conduct an interagency search for any records that may be in the possession of other government agencies, such as the Department of Justice or the Department of Transportation.\r\n\r\nI advise the FBI not to delete, redact, or withhold any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\nFurthermore, I request that any redactions made to the records be kept to a minimum and that any exemptions claimed by the FBI be explained in detail.\r\n\r\nTo help facilitate the search for these records, I provide the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nWWE plane incident\r\nFlight from Hell\r\nSexual assault allegations WWE\r\nFBI investigation WWE\r\nWWE misconduct investigation\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

As you may be aware, Mr. Benoit was responsible for the deaths of his wife and son before taking his own life.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned citizen and journalist, I believe it is important to understand the full extent of any FBI investigations or inquiries into Chris Benoit and his family. Therefore, I request access to any and all records related to Chris Benoit, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny FBI investigation or inquiry into Chris Benoit or his family members\r\nWitness statements and interviews conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies related to Chris Benoit\r\nCorrespondence between the FBI and the WWE or its employees regarding Chris Benoit\r\nAny reports or memoranda created as a result of investigations related to Chris Benoit\r\nAny other documents or information related to Chris Benoit or any investigations related to him or his family, including Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records\r\nFor your reference, I have attached a copy of an article related to Chris Benoit to this request.\r\n\r\nI advise the FBI not to delete, redact, or withhold any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\nFurthermore, I request that any redactions made to the records be kept to a minimum and that any exemptions claimed by the FBI be explained in detail.\r\n\r\nTo help facilitate the search for these records, I provide the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nChris Benoit investigation\r\nWWE wrestler Chris Benoit\r\nBenoit family deaths\r\nFBI investigation WWE\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting records related to the case of Tyler W. Massengill, who was charged with setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Illinois, as reported in the article referenced here: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/illinois-man-charged-setting-fire-planned-parenthood.\r\n\r\nIn order to assist with locating the records, I request that a search be conducted for all records related to Tyler W. Massengill and any associated individuals or organizations involved in the incident. I further request that this search be conducted across all relevant offices, divisions, and agencies, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) indices.\r\n\r\nTo narrow the scope of the search, I request that the following key strings be used in the search for responsive records: \"Tyler W. Massengill\", \"Planned Parenthood\", and \"fire\". I also request that this search be conducted for records from January 1, 2021 to the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be provided in their entirety, without redaction or deletion, unless such redaction or deletion is necessary to protect classified information, personal privacy, or other legally protected interests. Please note that any such redaction or deletion will be subject to challenge and may be compelled in court.\r\n\r\nFinally, I request that this request be expedited due to the nature of the information sought and the public interest in disclosure. As a reference for expedited processing, I cite the case of American Civil Liberties Union v. FBI, 710 F.3d 422 (2013), which held that a delay in the release of information pertaining to government activity that is already in the public domain can result in a lack of trust in government officials, thereby hindering their ability to carry out their duties.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request an interagency search for responsive records, including any records that may be held by other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search, I would like to request that the following key strings be used to identify potentially responsive records:\r\n\r\nTyler W. Massengill\r\nPlanned Parenthood arson\r\nIllinois\r\nI also request any Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records, including but not limited to wiretaps, surveillance logs, and monitoring reports related to Tyler W. Massengill or the Planned Parenthood arson case.\r\n\r\nTo support this request, I would like to reference the article from the Department of Justice (DOJ) website titled \"Illinois Man Charged with Setting Fire to Planned Parenthood\". The article states that Tyler W. Massengill was charged with damaging and destroying a Planned Parenthood facility by means of fire on October 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to cite the following case law to support this FOIA request:\r\n\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Department of Defense, 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\r\nNation Magazine v. United States Customs Service, 71 F.3d 885 (D.C.

Massengill/ Peoria Planned Parenthood arson.  Your request has been assigned number 2023-00936.  Please refer to this number on any future correspondence.  You are requesting information on a third party.  Disclosure of records relating to a third party is only permitted with the express authorization and written consent of the third party, proof of death of the third party, or a demonstration that the public interest in the disclosure outweighs the personal privacy interest of the third party.  Since you have not provided any documentation that would demonstrate your right to access the records of a third party, even to acknowledge the existence of such records pertaining to this individual would be in violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a and constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of his  personal privacy.  Therefore, I am refusing to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records.  Such a disclosure would constitute a violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a and the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C).  If you can obtain consent or provide proof of death, ATF may be able to release responsive documents should they exist.  In order to disclose information to you, you will need to have the individual verify his/her identity as required by Department regulation 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.41(d).  Specifically, if you would like this office to process your request and search for responsive records in this office, the individual will need to either (1) return a completed Form DOJ-361, Certification of Identity, to this office, or (2) provide a statement notarized or under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, indicating the individual\u2019s full name, place of birth, date of birth, and current address.  Please return either the Form DOJ-361 or the individual\u2019s notarized statement, along with your request, to the Information & Privacy Governance division.  You may mail your documents to 99 New York Avenue, NE, Room 4.E-301, Washington, DC 20226. In light of these circumstances, I am administratively closing your request in this office.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Zina Kornegay, at (202) 648-7390, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. If you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 666 F.

Additionally, any complaint filed with the appropriate court or administrative body will seek reimbursement of legal costs and fees.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting any and all records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny additional reports, investigations, or documents related to the death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza not included in the aforementioned DDR report;\r\nAny correspondence, including but not limited to emails, letters, or memoranda, related to the death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza;\r\nAny medical records or reports related to the care and treatment provided to Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza while in ICE custody;\r\nAny policies, procedures, or guidelines related to the care and treatment of detainees in ICE custody, specifically those related to medical care;\r\nAny video footage or photographs related to the death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza, including footage from surveillance cameras or body-worn cameras worn by ICE personnel;\r\nA list of all ICE employees who interacted with Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza from the time of his detention until his passing, including but not limited to officers, medical personnel, and administrative staff.\r\nTo help narrow the scope of this request, I am specifically interested in records from the time of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza's detention until his passing.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This includes information on the development and implementation of such algorithms, as well as any internal communications regarding their effectiveness and security.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting access to all responsive documents and programs related to the use of cryptographic algorithms, including but not limited to metadata collection programs like XKeyscore, and any other related programs or tools.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to reference several articles that discuss the importance of transparency and accountability in the use of cryptographic algorithms by government agencies, including the NSA. These articles are attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in any information related to Type 1-4 product types, as defined by the National Security Agency/Central Security Service Information Assurance Directorate (NSA/CSS IAD) Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Program. This may include information on the implementation and use of cryptographic algorithms in Type 1-4 products, as well as any internal communications or reports regarding their security and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the development, implementation, and effectiveness of these algorithms is crucial to ensuring that they are being used in a responsible and lawful manner. As a result, I believe that this request falls within the purview of the FOIA and that the NSA has a duty to provide access to these records in the interest of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive documents be provided in their entirety, without redaction or withholding, except in cases where the NSA can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Please note that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records without providing a specific justification may result in a complaint and legal action to compel the NSA to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
