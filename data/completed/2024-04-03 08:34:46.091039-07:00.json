        "communication": "Good evening Mr. Buhl,\r\n\r\nIn response to your California Public Records Act (CPRA) request dated March 21, 2024, regarding \"any spreadsheet or list maintained by the WPD showing all invoices and purchase orders submitted by or paid to vendors. If such a spreadsheet can be produced from the Department's accounting software showing amount of payment, date of payment, payee, and description of reason for payment, then I am requesting that spreadsheet. Please cover a period going back to 2012,\" the City Clerk Department has compiled the following response:\r\n\r\nCalifornia Government Code Section 7922.535 requires the City to provide a response to your request within 10 days of receipt indicating what, if any, of the documents sought will be disclosed. Government Code Section 7922.535 also permits the City to extend the period in which it responds to your request by an additional 14 days, if necessary. The City is requesting an extension because the City needs to compile and filter the data generated from a voluminous report through our financial software. As an example, the reports for FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 produced an excess of 1400 pages that need to be converted to excel and then filtered by department.  Once the records have been gathered, there will also be an examination to determine if any of the records are exempt from disclosure. A determination regarding your request will be sent to you no later than April 12, 2024, which is 14 days from the tenth day following the City's receipt of your request.\r\n\r\nIn the event the documents are collected and examined, and a determination on their disclosure is made prior to that time, we will provide you with that determination sooner. If you have any questions, please contact the City Clerk Department at (562) 567-9850.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01DA8464.D542ECE0]<http://www.cityofwhittier.org/> City Clerk Department\r\n13230 Penn St. | Whittier, CA 90602\r\n(562) 567 - 9850 | Email: ccd@cityofwhittier.org<mailto:ccd@cityofwhittier.org> | www.cityofwhittier.org<http://www.cityofwhittier.org/>\r\nGo Green!

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(p) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[r]ecords relating to collective negotiating matters between public bodies and their employees or representatives, except that any final contract or agreement shall be subject to inspection and copying.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(p). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

Contents of emails and attachments highlighted on attached email log released via FOIA N014773-020124. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including race/ethnicity, cell phone numbers, personal email addresses, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Course materials or research materials used by faculty members have been redacted pursuant to section (j)(iv) of the FOIA. 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iv). Redactions have been applied pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(p) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[r]ecords relating to collective negotiating matters between public bodies and their employees or representatives, except that any final contract or agreement shall be subject to inspection and copying.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(p). Finally, please note that records that do not pertain to the transaction of public business have been withheld from release. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\n\nFor ANY AND ALL canine use within the Fitchburg Public Schools between August 1, 2018 to the date of receipt of this FOIA request, please provide:\r\n\r\n    1) the DATES, TIMES, AND DURATION of the canine use; and\r\n    2) LOCATION of the canine use, as specific as possible (for example, if a canine search was limited to a bathroom then the school and room number; or if a canine search was performed on all lockers but did not extend into any classroom, then that should be noted); and\r\n    3) the REASON(S) for the use; and\r\n    4) the LEGAL JUSTIFICATION for the reason(s) for the use, citing statute and/or case law if possible; and\r\n    5) the NAME OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT(S) involved in the canine use, including but not limited to any police department present during the canine use even if that police department was not the owner or handler of the canine(s); and\r\n    6) if the canine(s) is owned by a police department, the NAME(S) AND BADGE/ID NUMBER(S) of the canine(s) involved; and \r\n    7) if the canine(s) is NOT owned by a police department, the name(s) of the canine(s) involved, and the name, address, phone number, and email of the OWNER of the canine(s); and \r\n    8) if the canine(s) is NOT owned by a police department, the name(s) of the HANDLER(S) of the canine(s); and \r\n    9) if the canine(s) is NOT owned by a police department, any and all contracts, memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, and any other official contract concerning the canine(s) and police department requesting the canine(s) use; and\r\n    10) THE NAME(S) AND BADGE NUMBER(S) of the police department employee(s) involved; and the name(s) of the Fitchburg Public School ADMINISTRATOR(S) AND OTHER EMPLOYEES in charge of the canine use, including but not limited to any school employee who made the request, directly monitored the canine usage, or who otherwise acted as a school representative concerning the canine use; and\r\n    11) any and all RESULTS of the canine use, including but not limited to non-productive searches; and\r\n    12) if the canine use was requested or required by the Fitchburg Public Schools, the name of the Fitchburg Public School employee REQUESTOR(S); and\r\n    13) if the canine use requested or required by the Fitchburg Police Department, the name of the Fitchburg Police Department employee REQUESTOR(S).\r\n\r\nThe term \"canine\" is intended to mean a police-owned or police-commissioned dog that is utilized for searches or other police functions within schools. Police functions also includes but is not limited to:\r\n- searches\r\n- demonstrations\r\n- teaching\r\n- training\r\n- any other ancillary police function\r\nas long as the canine use was performed in the Fitchburg Public School, on Fitchburg Public School owned property, and/or requested by the Fitchburg Public Schools.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this FOIA request is for the records produced or maintained by each department (for example, the Fitchburg Public School district, or the Fitchburg Police Department, and not simply one school within the system or one police building). Therefore this information must be from each department's records, and not coordinated with any other department, entity, agency, or group, unless that outside department's normally stores or maintains records for that department. For example, the school can provide a police report which the school has on file prior to this public records request, but should not request a police report from a police department solely in order to fulfill this public records request.\r\n\r\nFees for public records requests are defined in part in Massachusetts law 950 CMR 32.07 (2)(m) for municipal records and 950 CMR 32 (2) in general.\n\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNeal Delfeld\n\n",

The request was for \"Cobwebs Contract\".\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request, and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\nA determination as to whether your request is granted or denied will be reached on or before June 6, 2024, or we will notify you in writing if the responsible program area(s) should require additional time to locate, assemble and review documents that may be responsive to your request.\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.  When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: **\r\nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through Open FOIL.  Submitting a duplicate request takes time away from processing the hundreds of requests received each month.

        "communication": "Dear FOIL Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of FOIL NYSP-23-12-1041, completed on March 5, 2024, which yielded 53 pages of records. Specifically, this is an appeal of the redactions found on pages 18, 47, 52, and 53 of that package of yielded records.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Police redacted the documents based on Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(b) (\"personal privacy\"); \u00a787(2)(d) (\"trade secrets ... the disclosure of which would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the vendor\"); and \u00a787(2)(d) (\"intra-agency material\").\r\n\r\nRegarding \u00a787(2)(d): The New York state Committee on Open Government, citing the United States Supreme Court (Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 1973), has repeatedly made clear: \"Trade secrets\" refer only to actual secrets, \"and must not be of public knowledge or of a general knowledge in the trade or business.\" (See the attached example COG advisory opinion.)\r\n\r\nBut in its redactions of pages 18, 47, 52, and 53 of the yielded documents, the New York State Police seem to have redacted any and all information related to a product it procurred from Cobwebs America, Inc. in November 2023, including the names of the products procurred.\r\n\r\nAs such, I request that a FOIL appeals officer review the redactions on pages 18, 47, 52, and 53, and re-produce the documents with only information related to actual trade secrets redacted.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time. Please feel free to email me at chris@nysfocus.com or call (419) 309-6331 if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

However, this request is identical to a recently fulfilled request (13-00238-F) for the exact same records, save for the date range -- this request is for 2013 records, while 13-00238-F was for the same records from 2012.\r\n\r\nPlease clarify why this request has been rejected as overly burdensome, while an identical request for 2012 was fulfilled without any clarification whatsoever. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nShawn Musgrave\r\nMuckRock",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of body cam footage from the arrest of Vitallii Kovalev, also possibly known as Vitalii Kovalev and Vitaly Kovalev. Mr. Kovalev was arrested on June 16, 2020. His arrest number is MCSO20ARR002460 and offense number MCSO20OFF003605. The arresting officer was Ty Torres.\r\n\r\nThis footage was previously released to CBS News, and aired on its news magazine program 60 Minutes on Sunday, March 31, 2024. As this footage has already been displayed publicly by a major news network, there should be no additional concerns for releasing it to the public.\r\n\r\nVerification of the public display of the footage can be found on 60 Minutes' YouTube channel. Please see the following link, beginning at 5:00: https://youtu.be/JdPSD1SUYCY?si=UrAQyCQvt9U4S0Tn\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

It only gives the numbers on the tag. He has no way of separating Florida tags from out of state tags. You might consider reaching out to FLOCK directly to see if they can provide the specific data you are looking for. Additionally, the FLOCK reports can only be run in 30 day periods and contain every vehicle that is captured by the cameras which will be in the thousands each month. This is really not the data you are requesting and time to redact thousands of entries for each 30 day period will be extremely time consuming and costly. Since the ALPR cannot determine individual state tags, every tag both in-state and out-of-state that is captured is ran in FLOCK\u2019s database which compares the tag number with NCIC/FCIC data.\r\n\nMajor Johnny Greenwood\r\nDepartment of Administrative Services\r\nPutnam County Sheriff\u2019s Office\r\n130 Orie Griffin Blvd.\r\nPalatka, Florida 32177\r\n(386) 329-0820",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Mira Slovak, listed by the FBI's RIDS Dead List as dying on 6/16/2014 nad having been an anti-Communist Czech defector to the U.S. Per FBI standards and regulations, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

Are there specific words/terms that should be searched, or is there a particular subject matter you are interested in? Even with the fairly narrow date range, the search could produce a number of records pertaining to a variety of subjects, and the responsive records will have to be reviewed individually for any confidential information that may be exempt from disclosure based on Iowa Code Chapter 22. In accordance with our fee schedule<https://transparency.uiowa.edu/faqs/public-records-fee-schedule>, we charge a rate of $30/hour, with one hour free, for the time to retrieve, review, and redact records. Please also note that we are processing a high volume of other requests at the moment, and requests for emails generally take longer for us to complete, due to the legal review required.\r\n\r\nPlease also be aware that if the search produces any records pertaining to personnel matters, those would likely be exempt from disclosure based on Iowa Code 22.7(11) (confidential personnel records).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to narrow the scope of your request, or if you want to proceed with your request as written. I will be in touch to let you know if there will be costs for the retrieval/review.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAubree\r\n\r\n\r\nAubree Johnson\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nThe University of Iowa\r\n351 Plaza Centre One\r\nIowa City, IA 52242\r\npublic-records@uiowa.edu<mailto:public-records@uiowa.edu>\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: THIS MESSAGE AND ANY RESPONSE TO IT MAY CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC RECORD, AND THEREFORE, MAY BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH IOWA PUBLIC RECORDS LAW, IOWA CODE CHAPTER 22.",

Superior Court, 19 Cal. App.4th 469, 481 (1993). \u201cWholesale requests for general information to be analyzed, collected and compiled by the responding government entity are not encompassed therein.\u201d Hodai v. City of Tucson, C20141225 (Ariz. Super. Ct. 2014) citing mag Entertainment LLC v. Div. of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067. 1076 (N.J. Sup. Ct., App. Div. 2005).\u00a0 A government agency is not required to respond to an overly broad request that does not seek specific records.\u00a0 Id. at 1074, citing Capitol Info. Assoc. v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985). \r\nIn regards to your request for those who have completed Title IX training for the academic year of 2023-2024, the University does not maintain records as requested.\u00a0 Training takes place within 6 months of hire and then every two years thereafter.\u00a0 See NSHE Handbook, Title 4, Chapter 8, Section 14(A)(2)(b). \r\nHowever, UNLV can report that as of March 26, 2024, 7,296 employees have completed training.

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 98 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 947 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,011 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,360 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the extra-large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.fbi.gov%2Ffdps-1%2F%40%40search-fdps&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=B6S2vFgDgOWQqiCCwRvUsZQgDAHF1diXKG5fYH3T12M%3D&reserved=0> | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbi.gov%2Ffoia&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uaXvm%2Fg3l2HzET7puRKzFvk4XQEvSW%2FUHofbeKfFAng%3D&reserved=0> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D9F6A0.23F1CDF0][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]\n",

Gov't Code, which provides that an e-mail address of a member of the public that is provided for the purpose of communicating electronically with a governmental body is confidential and not subject to disclosure.  Additional redactions have been made per The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), where a student's identifying information appears within the records.\r\n\r\nSection 552.275 of the Texas Government Code authorizes a governmental body to establish a reasonable limit, not less than 15 hours for a one month period or 36 hours in a 12 month period, on the amount of time that personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies to a requestor, without recovering the costs attributable to the personnel time related to that requestor. Section 552.275 does not replace or supersede other sections, and it does not preclude a governmental body from charging labor for a request for inspection or copies for which a charge is authorized under other sections of this law.\r\n\r\nKeller ISD has established 15 hours in a one-month period and 36 hours per 12-month period as the reasonable limit on the amount of time personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies without recovering attributable costs. This 12-month period coincides with the District's fiscal year, which begins on July 1. Requestors who exceed the 36-hour time limit in a fiscal year (or 15 hours in one month) shall pay all costs attributable to cost of materials, personnel time, and overhead expenses necessary to comply with the request, even if the requestor intends to only inspect the documents.  For the 2023-2024 fiscal year thus far, the District has spent 1.0 hour(s) responding to requests you have submitted to date (since July 1, 2023) and provided you with the records gathered and compiled as a result.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the District's response to the March 13, 2024 request.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nKeller ISD Public Records\r\nP: 817-744-1000 | F: 817-744-1263\r\nwww.kellerisd.net<http://www.kellerisd.net/>",

Doing so would remove approximately 1685 pages. There are approximately 18,649 potentially responsive pages, so removing the court documents alone wouldn't be enough to move the request from the extra-large track (> 8,000 pages). We would be happy to make this reduction for you, but would ask that you consider making a further reduction to move the request into one of the faster tracks. Would you possibly be willing to reduce the request to up to 950 pages to move the request into the medium track? You are always welcome to request additional material once a release has been made. We could take the first 950 pages, the last 950, or split between the beginning and end of the file if you would like.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to move forward.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n540-868-1695",

Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",
