We are unable to tell why. So, I am requesting these records: \r\n\r\n1. The FOIA request which you assigned tracking number 2023-03329\r\n\r\n2. The tracking sheet your agency used to track the progress of this FOIA request \r\n\r\n3. Any agency communications describing whether and how to respond to this FOIA request \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n4. A copy of the documents that responsive to the FOIA request. For this part, please note that some may need to be partially redacted. In your adjudication letter, you threw in a laundry list of exemption codes, but these likely don\u2019t justify withholding 873 pages in full. For B7A specifically, the mere pendency of enforcement proceedings is an inadequate basis for the invocation of B7(A) with showing that some distinct harm could reasonably be expected to result if the record or information requested were disclosed. Miller v. USDA, 13 F.3d 260, 263 (8th Cir. 1993)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
