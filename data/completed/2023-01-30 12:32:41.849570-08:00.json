Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.

Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.  Within twenty working days after the District completes request # R000001-020722, it will provide you with the first installment of responsive records to request #R000175-111622.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Good Afternoon:\r\n\r\nThe District received your public records request which was received on December 1, 2022.  In your request you sought:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\nThe District uses GovQA to accept, track and answer all public records requests. In your original request you stated that you decline the use of GovQA.  Therefore the District has been and will continue to use its own e-mail system to communicate with you and to provide you with responsive records. One of the limitations to the District\u2019s use of its own e-mail system is the size of the file it can send. Therefore the District must break up the responsive records into smaller files so that they can be e-mailed to you.\r\n\r\nIncluded with this are responsive records.  The District will continue to provide you with installments of the responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

Due to the size of the video files and your request to have all of the responsive records sent to you by e-mail and not use the District's GovQA portal, the District may need break these files into smaller files.\r\n\r\nBeginning December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mead School District received your public records request on November\r\n9, 2021. This serves as the District\u2019s response within five (5) business\r\ndays, as required by law.  You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish\r\nto have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.\r\nBut, the second segment of your request is not clear to us.  So, we are in\r\nneed of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to\r\nreceive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to\r\nour School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to\r\nJanuary 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those\r\nrecords for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests\r\nwould have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via\r\nemail.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file\r\nlocation, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical\r\nfile location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have\r\nbeen received by the person designated as our public records officer at the\r\ntime the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably\r\nbeen received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate\r\nall such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That\r\nis because we cannot be required to read every single email received by\r\nevery employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to\r\nlocate for you those had content qualifying them as public records\r\nrequest.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would\r\nbe to employ electronic \u201ckeyword\u201d searches, of our \u201cinbound\u201d email\r\ndatabases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well\r\nbe unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case\r\nthat some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public\r\ndisclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words\r\nor phrasing \u2013 such as \u201cpublic record\u201d \u2013 when submitting their requests.  In\r\nfact, our state\u2019s public disclosure law provides that in order for a public\r\nagency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under\r\nthat statute, the records requestor need only not submit it to a particular\r\nemployee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public\r\ndisclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any\r\nparticular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \u201ckeyword\u201d search terms that would likely yield\r\nevery single records request that our District has received, via email over\r\nthe last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.\r\nHowever, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws\r\nsuggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative\r\ncollaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword\r\nsearch terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I\u2019d like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please\r\ngive me a call, to discuss that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records\r\nrequests we\u2019ve received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have\r\nreceived such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These\r\nlargely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of\r\nstaff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records\r\nrequests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response\r\nto the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of\r\npartial-batch-installments.   We are now estimating that you should expect\r\nto receive the first installment within 90 days of this email\r\n(approximately February 14, 2021).\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an\r\nadvance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are\r\nallowable under our state\u2019s public disclosure law.  I will advise you if\r\nthat will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 90-day\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish\r\nus to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \u201ca\r\ncomplete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to each of the public\r\nrecords requests we\u2019ll be providing you.   By \u201cResponses,\u201d that could be\r\nfairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you\r\ndo or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to\r\nreceive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered,\r\ncopied, and provided to each given requestor, in \u201cResponse\u201d to his or her\r\nrequest (i.e., because those records had content falling within the\r\ndescriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently\r\n\u201cRespond\u201d to requestors by directing letters or email communications to\r\nthem that contain no actual \u201cResponsive\u201d records, but instead communicate\r\nwith the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry\r\nthat arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this\r\nemail is a precise example of that sort of \u201cResponse\u201d.)\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019re in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a\r\nreasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do\r\nwish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to the dialogue I\u2019ve initiated with\r\nyou concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable\r\nlist of \u201ckeyword\u201d searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public\r\nrecords requests you\u2019ve requested, and also to receiving the clarification\r\nI also requested above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me\r\nto your records request to our School District, and the one you received\r\nfrom the counterpart representative of mine at the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School\r\nDistrict has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to\r\nanswer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.\r\nThat\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request,\r\nto foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I\r\noffered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about\r\nwhich you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative\r\ncommunication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public\r\nRecords Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as\r\nyourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with\r\nyour request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be\r\nlocated for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are\r\npresented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all\r\nresponsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like\r\ninitial responses from our School District and the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response\r\nto the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at\r\nall a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records\r\nrequest that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to\r\ndouble-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill\r\nall of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the\r\ncourse of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to\r\nconsult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for\r\nadditional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d\r\nPRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts\r\nbelieve that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so\r\nnot only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of\r\nprocessing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records\r\nrequestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances\r\nassurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely\r\nand -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable,\r\nnon-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the\r\ndistrict\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the\r\nvery outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed\r\nreceives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public\r\ndisclosure requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same\r\nbest practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources\r\noutside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process\r\nand fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by\r\nhappenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside\r\nresource for that assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical\r\nrequest, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA\r\nresource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request,\r\nit is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in\r\ncommunicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of\r\nyour requests to both our School District and the Evergreen School District\r\nwere and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a\r\nneed to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology,\r\ntime frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our\r\nrespective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the\r\nsame outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses,\r\ntoward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and\r\nindeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually\r\nidentically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we want to acknowledge and assure you\r\nthat we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d\r\napproach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.\r\nThat could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the\r\nPRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has\r\nalso been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school\r\ndistrict, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and\r\nwill be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the\r\ndifferent sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will\r\nneed to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of\r\nexamples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as\r\ncompared to the Evergreen School District to the particular internal\r\nprocesses we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are\r\nassured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated\r\nby the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the\r\nprotocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and\r\n-archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the\r\nrequest in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or\r\nlesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in\r\nterms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to\r\ndedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of\r\nexperience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as\r\nto unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that\r\nstaff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other\r\nhigh-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our\r\nrespective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and\r\nprotecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of\r\nemployees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g.,\r\nadministrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to\r\ndedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the\r\nrequest, and their ability to perform that work while still performing\r\ntheir duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff\r\navailability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work\r\non the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the\r\nEvergreen School District (or for that matter, as compared to any other\r\nschool district that has received your request) likely will end very\r\nshortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested,\r\ncollaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my\r\ninitial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the\r\nbenefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture\r\ntoward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best\r\nmeets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

Further, I do not believe your explanation regarding the \u201csameness\u201d of the obviously plagiarized EVERGREEN 11-16-21 email to be offed in good faith. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nRegardless, the following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\nAs previously acknowledged the Mead School District received your public\r\nrecords request on November 9, 2021. You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached please find a 1st installment to your request. We would like to\r\nnote a couple of items with this first installment. First, it is smaller\r\nthan we had anticipated being able to provide, as we ran into significant\r\ntechnical issues with collecting the records in the Native format as you\r\nrequested. Secondly, we did have to make some additional redactions to one\r\nof the requests we are providing, as the requestor has changed and certain\r\nFERPA exemptions now apply to the records. In order for us to be able to\r\nmake the applicable redactions we have had to provide those records in PDF\r\nform (with the metadata included). We have also provided a withholding log\r\nthat reflects those redactions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, pursuant to RCW 42.56.520, I am hereby notifying you that the\r\nMead School District estimates we will be able to respond more fully to\r\nyour request on or before March 30, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised of the District's recently updated Policy on providing\r\nrecords, waiver of costs, and agreements regarding costs. The District will\r\ntake reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner\r\navailable to the District in its normal operations, which will typically be\r\nin electronic format. The following is the District's fee structure for\r\nelectronic records:\r\n\r\n1.  Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format\r\nor for the use of  District equipment to scan the records.\r\n\r\n2.  Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to\r\nemail, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n3.  Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an\r\nelectronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n4.  The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the\r\nDistrict, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the\r\ncopies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge for the included installment is so de minimis that it has been\r\nwaived at this time. The possible charge for the remaining records,\r\nhowever, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges. So,\r\nplease be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before\r\nwe'll be able to provide you with future installments.\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Officer or designee may require a deposit of up to ten\r\npercent of the estimated costs of copying all the records selected by the\r\nrequestor, including the cost of a customized service charge according to\r\nthe provision. If the requestor fails to pay a deposit or final payment for\r\nthe requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and\r\nindicate to the requestor that the District has closed the request.\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges\r\nbefore charges are imposed under this procedure. The requestor will be\r\nallowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges.\r\n\r\nThe following links provide more detailed information regarding the\r\nDistrict's Public Records Policy\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Policy_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n and Procedure\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Procedure_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency.\r\n\r\nI am requesting digital copies of all responsive documents.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the New Jersey Supreme Court wrote that complaints against and commendations of police officers are confidential internal affairs records: \u201cthe progress of internal affairs investigations and all supporting material are considered confidential information.\u201d Rivera v. Union Cty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office, 250 N.J. 124, 142 (2022). The only publicly available police evaluations are records placed into the recently created tables listing officers who have faced Major Discipline. See In Re Att\u2019y General Directive, 246 N.J.462 (2021) (upholding the AG\u2019s creation of a public database in which police list officers who have faced Major Discipline, where Major Discipline is demotion, termination, or suspension of 5 days or more.) As a courtesy, the publicly available tables listing NPD officers who suffered Major Discipline are accessible through this link: https://npd.newarkpublicsafety.org/statistics/transparency.\n",

The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

The following email from Missye Brickell on page 8 of PDF 1 (pages 1-112)from Intel which says \"... and CHIPS for America Act implementation relevant to OSTP\" appears to be the only relevant email and is basically what we are looking for (communication between Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, TSMC and OSTP relating to the CHIPS Act). PDF 2 also does not appear to have any relevant info (we are not looking for any climate related info).\r\n\r\nWould you be able to narrow the scope further and revert with emails, memos, communiques, presentations, similar to the one by Missye Brickell that specifically state the \"CHIPS for America Act\" or \"CHIPS Act\" or \"CHIPS\" or 'semiconductor subsidies' and originating from the following domain names: @intel.com, @nvidia.com, @nvidia.com @tsmc.com.

Unfortunately, the search request was submitted a few weeks ago. It covers June 1, 2021 through October 24, 2022. When we receive a FOIA request, we draft the search terms and parameters for submission to the e-discovery component. They, in turn, run the searches. Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that. But please keep in mind that we process FOIA requests on a first-in, first- out basis. Thus, the requests that were submitted ahead of the newly submitted one would have to be processed first.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA.\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Wednesday, December 7, 2022 5:40 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nDecember 7, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nApologies if I am mixing up the terminology.\r\n\r\nOn 1st December 2022 you stated that the \"The next interim production has not been processed.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Unfortunately, the search request was submitted a few weeks ago. It covers June 1, 2021 through October 24, 2022. When we receive a FOIA request, we draft the search terms and parameters for submission to the e-discovery component. They, in turn, run the searches. Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that. But please keep in mind that we process FOIA requests on a first-in, first- out basis. Thus, the requests that were submitted ahead of the newly submitted one would have to be processed first.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA.\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com> <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, December 7, 2022 5:40 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nDecember 7, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nApologies if I am mixing up the terminology.\r\n\r\nOn 1st December 2022 you stated that the \"The next interim production has not been processed.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com> <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Robbie Waters.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

If the totality of this response does not answer\r\nyour questions, please let me know. \r\nFor instance a 10% deposit of $300.00 could represent 30,000 scanned\r\npaper pages @ .10 per page. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever for which years and in what format? \r\nThe district's estimate is based on 10 years of documents, that\r\nrepresents over 800 requests.  Some of those requests are hundreds of\r\npages. Again, some of the district's responses were provided\r\nelectronically and some were paper copies.  The 30,000 pages represents\r\nless than half of the expected pages of documents. At this point in\r\nresponding to the request, the law does not require the district to\r\ncount every page, but rather give you an estimate of costs. Based on the\r\nnumber of public records requests received and the number of files that\r\nare electronic versus paper for a ten year period of time, the district\r\nprovided its best estimate. I am happy to have a phone conversation on\r\nthe district's estimate.\r\n\r\nPlease note we have requested responsive records to be produces in\r\nreverse chronological format with the newest records produced first. \r\n\r\nThe request for the newest records first is noted.  The district will\r\nprovide newest records first.  As you know, RCW 42.56.120(4) states: \"An\r\nagency may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed ten percent of\r\nthe estimated cost of providing copies for a request, ...\" The deposit\r\nrequested is the district estimated cost of providing copies for your\r\npublic records request. This is a low estimate based on the anticipated\r\n50-80,000 pages of public records responses. You will only be charged\r\nfor those documents that need to be scanned in for the first time.\r\n\r\nIf you want to modify your request and specify a different time span, I\r\nam happy to recalculate the anticipated cost.  \r\n \r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJen Anderson | Vancouver Public Schools\r\nParalegal to Marilee Scarbrough, General Counsel and Taylor Richman,\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nPO Box 8937 - 2901 Falk Road | Vancouver, WA  98668-8937\r\n( 360-313-1280 | 7 360-313-1012\r\n( tel:3603131012)  | * jen.anderson@vansd.org\r\n \r\n  --CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE--\r\nTHIS MESSAGE AND/OR THE DOCUMENT(S) ACCOMPANYING THIS ELECTRONIC\r\nTRANSMISSION MAY CONTAIN PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\r\nINTENDED ONLY FOR THE USE OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY NAMED ABOVE.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \n\n RE: Public Records Request of January 11, 2023, Reference # R000321-011123 Dear 120965-29141669@requests.muckrock.com, Vancouver Public Schools received a public records request from you on January 11, 2023. You requested: Hello, \n\n1. Why are you sending me these records in response to my 11-05-2021 Public Records request? RESPONSE : The District's January 10, 2023 response was inadvertently sent to you in error. 2. After review of records provided in response to my 11-05-21 public records requests, it appears as if I was charged fees for ptining and scanning of electronic documents. I did not request this. I asked for a breakout of fees and I did not receive one. I need a refund of all fees paid on this request where electronic records were printed and scanned and applied fees.\u00a0\u00a0Please provide a detailed record of how every penny of fees were applied to responsive documents in this request. If your agency is going to charge fees you are going to be required to explain and justify every cent under the law.\u00a0\u00a0Attached are examples of some of these records. RESPONSE : On November 5, 2021 you requested the following: \"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Vancouver Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 2, 2021.\"\u00a0\u00a0The District appropriately notified and invoiced you, via the attached correspondence, of the amount of records scanned and the associated costs on January 10, 2022, March 11, 2022 and April 22, 2022.\u00a0 You paid two of the three invoices, and the requested documents were released to you. Copies of your requests are attached and they can also be accessed by logging into the District's public records portal at the following link below. Public Records Request - R000321-011123 In April, 2022, Vancouver School District converted the management of all public records requests to the District's Public Records Request portal.\u00a0 The most effective and efficient way to communicate with the District regarding the status and responsive documents to your request is via your specific public records request log-in. The complete instructions for filing a public records request with Vancouver School District can be found via our website at: https://vansd.org/public-records-request/ The district has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request. Please log in to the Public Records Portal at the following link to retrieve the responsive records. Public Records Request - R000321-011123 In response to this request, no records were withheld in their entirety or redacted based on a statutory exemption (RCW 42.56 Washington State Public Records Act).\u00a0 With the submission of this information, we believe we have fully complied with your request and we will close the file. The District desires to provide you with the fullest assistance possible.\u00a0 If you believe this response does not fully comply with your public records request, please reply to this email.

You requested: \u201cRequest for a complete electronic copy of any emails containing the keyword \u201cMUCKROCK\u201d received by the email address \u2018publicrecordsrequest@vansd.org\u2019 for the time period 11-01-22 to 12-21-22.\u201d The above request was received at jen.anderson@vansd.org which is the business email for the District's legal assistant. The District acknowledged the request on January 3, 2023 after the District reopened for business after the winter break (December 19, 2022 through January 2, 2023) It appears the initial response was mistakenly sent to the wrong Muckrock identifier (120965-29141669). The District herewith resubmits this response to the correct Muckrock identifier, listed above. The District has identified, gathered and reviewed the requested documents and encloses them herewith. Please log in to the Public Records Portal at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.

The complete instructions for filing a public records request with Vancouver School District can be found via our website at: https://vansd.org/public-records-request/ In response to this request, no records were withheld in their entirety or redacted based on a statutory exemption (RCW 42.56 Washington State Public Records Act).\u00a0 With the submission of this information, we believe we have fully complied with your request and we will close the file. The District desires to provide you with the fullest assistance possible.\u00a0 If you believe this response does not fully comply with your public records request, please reply to this email.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clover Park School District received your public records request on November 5, 2021. Your request seeks all public records requests received by the District from January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021, as well as a complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s responses to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests since 2010 have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question, and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.     Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2.     Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3.     Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4.     The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the district, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing the first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by February 4, 2022. I have also submitted your request to our NextRequest Program on November 5, 2021, at 3:29 pm. This will also include our 5-day response from our District.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAranka Holmes\r\n\r\nCoordinator for Public Records, WC Claims, and ADA\r\n\r\n[cid:b525986e-eb5d-4ccc-9e3e-be0e3be9d7ee]\r\n\r\nCreating Promising Futures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Services Center\r\n\r\n10903 Gravelly Lake Dr SW, Lakewood WA  98499-1341\r\n\r\n253-583-5083 \u2022  Fax 253-583-5088\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail message and all attachments, if any, may contain confidential and privileged material and are intended only for the person or entity to which the message is addressed.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records.\u00a0See\u00a034 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe District would like you to clarify whether you are seeking those requests for records which would qualify as FERPA requests, or if you are purely seeking the records produced under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.

This grant will help the\r\nCity to:\r\n\r\n* Develop regulations or procedures to expedite approvals for a\r\nsignificant portion of development proposals. This includes a separate,\r\nnon-discretionary permit review of projects that are consistent with the\r\nCity of Oakland's General Plan and Planning Code.\r\n\r\n* Prepare Objective Design Standards to streamline processing for a\r\nvariety of proposals, especially affordable housing and projects near\r\nBART and along major transit corridors.\r\n\r\nThe objective design standards will be applied broadly to projects\r\nconsisting of a wide array of building types throughout the City of\r\nOakland. Creation of the objective design standards for\r\nnon-housing-related projects will come from a separate funding source.\r\n\r\nThe desired consultant team will include one or more multi-disciplinary\r\nplanning and design firm(s) with expertise in the following areas:\r\ndeveloping objective design standards in ethnically, linguistically and\r\nculturally diverse communities; creating programs and processes that\r\nexpedite project review; practicing historic preservation planning; and\r\nengaging the local community and stakeholders in a participatory\r\nplanning process. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease visit Objective Design Standards website\r\nfor more\r\ninformation about the RFP and the project.\r\n\r\nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Friday, November 19, 2021 by 2:00 pm PST via iSupplier\r\n\r\nNOTE: Interested consultants must Register with iSupplier\r\n(the City\r\nof Oakland's procurement portal) to submit a proposal. \r\n\r\nInterested in partnership opportunities?\r\nFill out our Expression of Interest form\r\n\r\nto be identified as a firm interested in collaborating with other\r\nfirm(s) and to download the RFP.
