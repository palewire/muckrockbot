To do so, however, I need additional information regarding the contents of the 7,245 pages. I believe the most efficient way to obtain this information would be a phone call between the person responsible for reviewing the contents of the records and me. Is that possible?  In the meantime, here are my initial questions: \r\n\r\n1. To what  extent OIG is able to identify what, if any, portion of these records constitutes Outlook meeting/call invites/reminders/acceptances vs. substantive content? \r\n\r\n2. Is the organization of responsive records such search terms could be run to identify records in the inbox relating to specific facilities, inspections, or reports? \r\n\r\n3. How long does OIG estimate the production of these records would take, and when could such production begin? \r\n\r\n4. Does OIG anticipate any referrals to other agency components, and if so, which ones? \r\n\r\n5. If the records were limited to only reports regarding ICE and CBP, how many responsive pages are left? \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt responses to these questions. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nAndrew",

Please allow this to serve as the Department's initial response to and formal acknowledgement of your open records request.\r\n\r\nThe Department will attempt to provide all requested records, but due to confidentiality law, it is possible that some items may not be disclosed. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 50-18-70 et seq., the Department will provide our formal response within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nUnder Georgia law, an agency may impose a reasonable charge for the search, redaction, and production or copying cost of records responsive to an Open Records Request. The time and cost will be calculated by using the hourly salary of the lowest paid employee qualified to conduct the research of an Open Records Request, with no charge for the first fifteen minutes of employee time expended. DOR will provide an estimate to the requestor if the reasonably anticipated costs for Production Tasks exceed $25 and will defer the Production Tasks until the requestor agrees to pay estimated costs.\r\n\nPublic Information Office\r\nGeorgia Department of Revenue\r\n2595 Century Parkway, NE | Atlanta, GA 30345\r\nEmail: ORR@dor.ga.gov<mailto:ORR@dor.ga.gov>\r\nPhone: 678-536-9348\r\ndor.georgia.gov",

While the Department provided a copy of an Attorney General letter ruling from 2018, it's unclear how that ruling bears on the instant request. To the contrary, the ruling suggests that records of Department policies and manuals are not per se confidential. Further, it's unclear how a ruling about a given manual relates to the instant request, which presumably seeks different records.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Jessica Riley \r\n330-978-8228\r\njlr00026@mix.wvu.edu",

AHCA is also likely aware of the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of Fla. Stat. section 119.12 (2020).\r\n\r\nPlease email the documents or files, and any communications, to foia@invisibleinstitute.com. Please acknowledge and respond to my request promptly and in good faith, pursuant to Section\r\n119.07(1)(c), F.S. Cf. Hewlings v. Orange County, 87 So. 3d 839 (Fla. 5th DCA 2012). As the Attorney General\u2019s Government in the Sunshine Manual instructs, \u201cThe only delay in producing\r\nrecords permitted under Ch. 119, F.S., \u2018is the limited reasonable time allowed the custodian to retrieve the record and delete those portions of the record the custodian asserts are exempt.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nInvisible Institute is an award-winning nonprofit public accountability journalism organization based in Chicago. Our mission is to enhance the capacity of citizens to hold public institutions accountable. Because I, the requestor, am a journalist, and I seek the information in order to disseminate it to the public, and because the information regards the safety, welfare, and legal rights of the general public, I request a fee waiver for this data. It is not for commercial benefit because I am a member of the nonprofit news media whose principal purpose is to access and disseminate information regarding the general public\u2019s safety, welfare, and legal rights. To the extent you intend to assess any charges, please notify me to discuss first. Please limit any assessed fees to the \u201cactual cost of duplication,\u201d which means \u201cthe cost of the material and supplies used to duplicate the public record, but does not include labor cost or overhead cost associated with such duplication\u201d (Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.011(1)). \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and prompt attention to this matter. Please contact me should you have any questions related to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nInvisible Institute\r\nExperimental Station\r\n6100 South Blackstone Avenue\r\nChicago, Illinois 60637\r\nfoia@invisibleinstitute.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow",

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with the RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file a RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Cmmw. 2012). As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a Right-to-Know\u00a0Request pursuant to the RTKL and will process it as an informal request.  You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request. Please note that if you resubmit your request as a written request pursuant to the RTKL, the City will deem your informal request to have been withdrawn.\u00a0  The City\u2019s Open Records Policy can be found here:\u00a0  https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/   The statewide form appears at the end of the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. If you require a hard copy of the form and/or policy, please let me know and one will be provided.  The City reserves the right to assert any and all grounds of denial in its final response to your request.  Respectfully,  Margot B.

The Stewart Detention Center has the highest number of deaths in ICE custody of any facility in the ICE detention since FY17. \r\n2. Stewart is currently one of the most populated sites of detention in the ICE system. \r\n3. Calls to 911 in 2025 from Stewart have exceeded their numbers for any period over the past five years. \r\n4. Audio recordings of Stewart 911 calls reflect instances in which EMS units were unavailable to treat significant illnesses or injuries as a result of previous calls from the facility.\r\n5. Lack of access to timely emergency medical care threatens the health safety of people in Stewart and the surrounding community. \r\n6. ICE Mortality Reviewers have attributed lack of timely access to emergency medical care to a significant number of deaths in ICE custody. \r\n7. The records requested will shed light on whether, and to what extent, ICE is aware of the challenges posed and consequences created by its use of detention in high numbers at the Stewart facility. \r\n8. DHS-OIG, ICE OPR, IHSC, ICE ODO, Congress, and the General Accountability Office have all previously cited CoreCivic, ICE's Atlanta Field Office, and Stewart for violations of ICE's standards and contracts. \r\n9. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination through edited publications, and have previously been granted expedited processing by federal FOIA offices on this basis. \r\n10. These records are needed on an expedited basis to fill out the federal side of a piece for which I have received journalism grant funding and which will be published no later than October.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request was received in this office on 8/27/2025. Specifically, you requested records pertaining to ll Significant Event Notifications and Significant Incident Reports received by the IHSC Field Medical Coordinator or OAQ Contracting Officer pertaining to medical emergencies or 911 calls at the Stewart Detention Center for the period beginning January 1, 2024, and continuing through August 26, 2025. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2025-ICFO-57001.

You have requested records pertaining to Significant Event Notifications and Significant Incident Reports received by the IHSC Field Medical Coordinator or OAQ Contracting Officer pertaining to medical emergencies or 911 calls at the Stewart Detention Center for the period beginning January 1, 2024, and continuing through August 26, 2025. \r\n\r\nICE has considered your request under both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  Information about an individual that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records may be accessed by that individual unless the agency has exempted the system of records from the access provisions of the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nICE has conducted a search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request and no records responsive to your request were found. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within the above mentioned ICE office(s).  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of the original response letter, within 90 days of the date of the letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.  You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 and refer to your tracking number. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

Specifically, I seek documentation regarding the recent directive that instructs officers and command staff to conduct traffic enforcement exclusively on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the processing of this request, please provide:\r\n\r\n1. Any memos, emails, or internal communications from agency leadership discussing or promoting the strategy to issue tickets solely on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\n2. Statistical data or reports that outline traffic enforcement activities, including the number of tickets issued on Wednesdays compared to other days of the week.\r\n\r\n3. Any relevant guidelines or policies that mandate or suggest certain days for traffic enforcement over others.\r\n\r\n4. Information on the objectives behind this strategy and whether any analysis was conducted before its implementation.\r\n\r\nI propose a fee waiver for this request based on the public interest in transparency around law enforcement practices. This information is crucial for understanding how these policies may impact public safety and the fair application of traffic laws.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTransparentPolicing2026",

The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

A copy of that report is available here: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-07/OIG-22-47-July22.pdf. \r\n\r\nLikely Custodians: \r\nThe following DHS-OIG Custodians are believed to have responsive documents and should be tasked: \r\nJames Cuffari, Ph.D., John D. Shiffer, Chief Inspector; Stephanie Christian, Supervisory Lead Inspector Ian Stumpf, Senior Inspector; Erika Algeo, Inspector; Brett Cheney, Inspector; Lisa Knight, Communications Analyst; Lorraine Eide, Independent Referencer.\r\n\r\nProposed Temporal Period: \r\nThe following time period should be searched: \r\nOctober 1, 2021 - Present (i.e., the date on which DHS-OIG FOIA tasks an adequate search for responsive records). \r\nWe are willing to negotiate a narrower temporal period upon a representation from DHS-OIG that responsive records are unlikely to exist in all or part of the temporal scope we have requested. \r\n\r\nLikely Systems of Records: \r\nDHS-OIG should query any email systems the Likely Custodians use, as well as the government-issued phones these custodians use. \r\nDHS-OIG should query any SharePoint or similar drive containing records regarding the Folkston Inspection conducted in November 2021. \r\nDHS-OIG should query the JICMS for any responsive records as described above. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request (pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)\r\nOn behalf of the Al Otro Lado #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, we respectfully request expedited processing. \r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(i) - Harm to individuals from delayed production. DHS-OIG concluded in its publicly available report.  \r\n\r\n\u201cFolkston did not meet standards for facility conditions, medical care, grievances, segregation, staff-detainee communications, and handling of detainee property. We identified violations that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees. Folkston facilities were unsanitary and dilapidated, with torn mattresses, water leaks and standing water, mold growth and water damage, rundown showers, mold and debris in the ventilation system, insect infestations, lack of access to hot showers, inoperable toilets, an inoperable thermometer display on a kitchen freezer, and an absence of hot meals. Facility medical staff did not provide timely access to specialty care or adequate mental health care for detainees. Folkston did not provide timely or complete responses to detainee grievances and requests. Folkston also did not consistently provide required services to detainees in segregation and inappropriately handcuffed detainees. Further, ICE did not consistently respond to detainee requests in a timely manner and did not provide detainees with paper grievance forms and submission boxes as required. ICE also did not provide detainees sufficient contact with deportation officers. Lastly, the facility has improperly handled detainee property. In addition, Folkston has not met staffing levels required by the contract with ICE to ensure proper detainee oversight. In addressing COVID-19, Folkston did not consistently enforce use of masks and social distancing. In April 2021, Folkston began providing COVID-19 vaccinations to detainees.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2022, ICE responded to OIG\u2019s 13 recommendations, purportedly providing \u201ccorroboration\u201d that Folkston had been brought into compliance. ICE followed up on June 13, 2022, seeking OIG close its recommendations. OIG treated 12 of 13 recommendations as satisfied and closed them. However, it is unclear how or why OIG concluded it could rely upon the representations of ICE regarding how it had addressed each recommendation, such that the people locked inside Folkston experience a material change in their daily conditions. In several instances, ICE disputed OIG\u2019s findings, even while indicating it would \u201cconcur\u201d with the recommendations that it make changes to implement standards compliance. (See pages 39-42 of Report No. 22-47.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iii) \u2014 Loss of Substantial Due Process Rights to people inside Folkston from delayed production.\r\n\r\nEven after ICE represented to DHS-OIG that it had corrected many the violations it admits OIG documented during the unannounced inspection, detained people inside Folkston reported to DHS many of the very same violations OIG described. According to multiple detained individuals, these conditions unabated.\r\nSee, e.g., https://www.albanyherald.com/news/protests-at-ice-detention-center-mount-as-expansion-plans-move-forward/article_6c8cf39c-c25c-11ec-be63-8bbf37990359.html. \r\n\r\nAn active hunger strike remains ongoing at Folkston to protest these conditions. \r\n\r\nIn the past, ICE officials have attempted to deny the very conditions OIG found in its unannounced inspections during the agency\u2019s communications with House Appropriations Homeland Chair Lucille Roybal-Allard, according to FOIA records obtained from ICE: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6705734-ICE-Emails-Pertaining-to-Congressional-Inquiries.html. \r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv) \u2014 A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\r\n\r\nThe future of ICE detention in Georgia and ICE\u2019s use of private immigration detention contractors like The GEO Group is a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest on  which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence, and these records requests are directly responsive to this media interest. Accordingly, Expedited Processing is warranted under Section 5.5(e)(1)(iv). \r\n\r\nPresident Joe Biden told organizers at a Georgia car rally who interrupted his event to demand he keep his promise to close private prisons and immigration detention centers, \u201cGive me Five Days, Man.\u201d https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-give-me-five-days-hecklers-calling-closure-detention-centers-1587639. As the video makes clear, the President of the United States was referring to privately operated immigration detention centers, as well as private prisons. See also: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-georgia-rally-speech-protest-b1839959.html; https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/04/30/biden_to_protesters_give_me_another_five_days_to_fix_immigration.html; https://nypost.com/2021/04/29/biden-heckled-by-abolish-ice-protesters-teases-action-in-5-days/. \r\n\r\nInstead of ending private prisons in Georgia May 2021, President Biden ordered the termination of ICE\u2019s contract with the Irwin County Detention Center. By December 2021, however, it became clear that far from fulfilling his stated promise, the Biden Administration would actually expand its use of private immigration detention in Georgia: https://www.advancingjustice-atlanta.org/news/closefolkston. https://creativeloafing.com/content-500557-news-brief-private-prison-undergoing-expansion-while-under. \r\n\r\nThen, in February 2022, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported exclusively that the Biden Administration planned an unprecedented expansion of Folkston that would make it the largest ICE facility east of the Mississippi. https://www.ajc.com/news/exclusive-south-georgia-immigration-detention-complex-aims-to-expand/QN5G2BFOPREQHEBDOPPAX2PSVI/. \r\n\r\nIn apparent violation of the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations and Federal Acquisition regulations, this historic expansion would occur through a no-bid, single-vendor contract expansion. The beneficiary: The GEO Group. People supporting those locked inside Folkston protested: https://www.splcenter.org/presscenter/splc-planned-expansion-private-ice-detention-center-georgia-betrayal-biden. \r\n\r\nA people\u2019s movement seeking depopulation of the Folkston facility by ICE and cancellation of the Folkston Contract has been active since 2022. http://www.charltoncountyherald.com/news/second-rally-held-at-the-folkston-ice-processing-center/article_7254cb22-bfe3-11ec-8548-978ce9320949.html.  \r\n\r\nThe timing of DHS-OIG and ICE\u2019s responses to the findings of the November 2021 unannounced inspection raise significant questions about the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s planned expansion of Folkston. At the exact time OIG was informing ICE Folkston was serially non-compliant (OIG No. 22-47 contains perhaps more documented violations of ICE standards than any other DHS-OIG inspection of an ICE facility in history), ICE was planning to reward the contract with an additional expansion. At the exact same time OIG was informing ICE that its contractors had failed to follow through on the financial penalties against GEO that would have followed from the 2019 and 2020 contract discrepancy reports ICE issued, ICE was planning to further reward the non compliant contractor with a no-bid, multi year, multimillion dollar expansion. \r\n\r\nWhy did OIG wait and negotiate with ICE, given the violations it documented, rather than issuing a Management Alert, as it did in Torrance, NM? \r\n\r\nWhat \u201ccorroboration\u201d did ICE provide OIG? \r\n\r\nWhy, given the serial failures of ICE to accurately document the violations OIG found on unannounced inspection, did OIG take ICE at its word and not conduct a second unannounced inspection before closing out its recommendations? \r\n\r\nWhy do people inside Folkston still report the same violations OIG documented if OIG has concluded ICE remedied the violations? \r\n\r\nThe records requested carry the potential to answer these questions and more. The answers are required now \u2014 BEFORE ICE signs a multimillion dollar expansion of a facility that less than 8 months ago failed an unannounced inspection. Failure to grant expedited processing will deprive the public, people inside and those working with Congress and the agency of the public records necessary to corroborate or disprove the current allegations that Folkston is not fit for human occupancy, and is incapable of reform. \r\n\r\nFinally, it appears that despite knowing of OIG\u2019s findings, executives from The GEO Group made affirmative statements during shareholder calls and in public SEC filings that are contradicted by ICE\u2019s concurrence with those findings. Because GEO\u2019s market capitalization of $1.9bn is based nearly exclusively on its ability to obtain and maintain contracts with government partners \u2014 including the ~25-35% of its revenue ICE payments represent \u2014 the investing public has an urgent need to know whether GEO\u2019s executives misled shareholders and the SEC regarding the services the company renders at Folkston, and its relationship with ICE as a contracting partner. \r\n\r\nI certify that the above statements are true and correct pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nRequestor: \r\nAl Otro Lado and its #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Under NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-8, the City has determined that it does not have possession of and/or responsibility for the 911 call audio and transcripts, CAD logs, radio traffic, or any other dispatch records that you have requested.\u00a0 However, the City knows the proper custodian of these records to be Mesilla Valley Regional Dispatch Authority (MVRDA), 911 Lake Tahoe Ct., Las Cruces, NM, 88007, (575) 526-0795, https://www.mvrda.org/records-request-instructions/.\u00a0 As such, on December 1, 2025, the City forwarded your request to MVRDA.\u00a0 To expedite your request, you may consider submitting an additional records request to that agency's records custodian directly.\u00a0 In light of this notification, the City considers the request for dispatch records closed.  New Mexico Statutes Annotated (hereinafter \u201cNMSA\u201d) 1978, \u00a7 14-2-8(C) states, in pertinent part, that a \u201cwritten request . . .shall identify the records sought with reasonable particularity.\u201d The purpose of this requirement is to provide governmental agencies with the information necessary to accurately and fully respond to public record requests. Upon review, the City has determined that your request, as currently written, is too broad to process effectively. In order to facilitate a thorough and accurate response, the City will separate each case referenced in your request into individual requests. This approach allows us to address each case independently and ensures a more efficient and complete response. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this request is now closed. Please refer to the respective requests for each case moving forward. Sincerely, \r\nChristine Rivera \r\nRecords Custodian \r\n(575) 541-2112",
