The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v.

The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989).

He was born on January 7, 1916 and died on May 30, 1987. (Obituary: https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/obituaries/frank-licht-an-ex-governor-led-rhode-island-in-late-60-s.html)\r\n\r\nI submitted this same request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that informed me records potentially responsive to my request were potentially transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration. They told me to use file number 100-HQ-454565 serials 325 and 491 as a reference. If those records in that file are related to Frank Licht, I would like a copy of the file.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to another agency, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the NARA has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, and am currently a reporter of The Boston Globe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexa Gagosz",

The court document alleges \"Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 aimed to negotiate with V\u00e1zquez, recognizing that if Pierluisi\u2019sappointment failed, she would be positioned to become governor.\" The court document also alleges that \"V\u00e1zquez agreed to assist the FBI, starting by recording a conversation with , a Department of Justice contractor (\u201cContractor 1\u201d), who had been approached by , Puerto Rican Elected Official 1\u2019s cousin and a convicted felon, about arranging a meeting between V\u00e1zquez and Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 regarding the governorship.\" The document continues by saying that \"under the FBI's guidance, V\u00e1zquez recorded several conversations.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the document, the FBI closed the investigation in November 2019, citing difficulties in arranging meetings with V\u00e1zquez after she became governor. I have attached the document in its entirety to this communication.You can find the document here: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64868850/677/united-states-v-vazquez-garced/\r\n\r\nA news report revealed that Elected Official 1 and Elected Official 2 are former Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n. You can find the news report here: https://www.noticel.com/tribunales/ahora/top-stories/20240927/wanda-vazquez-grabo-a-rivera-schatz-y-a-gonzalez-colon-alegando-soborno-ante-fbi/\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following documents:\r\n\r\n1) The at least 16-page FBI report mentioned in both the court document and the news report in its entirety that mention an alleged \"\u201ca conspiracy between [Puerto Rican Elected Official 1] and [Puerto Rican Elected Official 2] of their intention of removing the [Governor V\u00e1zquez] so either [Puerto Rican Elected Official 1] or [Puerto Rican Elected Official 2] can become the governor.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is for all records produced between January 1, 2019 and the time this request is processed.  In the event there are multiple records, please send them to me on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nPlease do a search of main file records alongside cross-reference records and an ELSUR (electronic surveillance) records. Additionally, please search the Sentinel database, the Investigative Data Warehouse, and the Data Integration and Visualization System.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request expedited processing for this FOIA request because of significant public interest and urgency. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, one of the people reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is currently Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner and is running for Governor of Puerto Rico under the New Progressive Party. Similarly, Thomas Rivera Schatz, another person reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is running for the Senate of Puerto Rico. The FBI report could have pertinent information relating to both of their campaigns, a highly relevant topic given the approaching November 5 election. Access to this information is crucial for informing the public about potential implications for governance and policy direction. \r\n\r\nAs a journalist, timely access to this information will enable me to report on critical issues affecting the electorate, ensuring that voters have the necessary context as they prepare to make informed decisions. Delays in obtaining this information could impede public understanding and discourse surrounding the election, which is a matter of public concern. Delaying access to this information could hinder public understanding of and trust in the electoral process and the candidates involved, which are essential for an informed electorate. The information in the document is time-sensitive  given the November 5 election, which is less than 50 days away. There is significant public interest in the information within this report, given its relevance to current events and both politician's run for elected positions, which will impact voters and Puerto Rico public policy.\r\n\r\nIf any part of this request is denied, I would appreciate a detailed explanation for the denial, including the specific exemptions being claimed. Additionally, I would be grateful for your assistance in identifying any related documents that may exist.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am a freelance journalist recognized by multiple journalists associations who has worked for multiple local, state, and international publications. Any information gathered from this request will be used in reporting about politicians in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Any/all emails sent to the Kent School District Board of Directors email address: kentboardmembers@kent.k12.wa.us\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE FOR THIS REQUEST\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 2024 - September 27, 2024\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Specifically those pertaining to conditions, design decisions or other that resulted an increase in proposed project costs over that period from an initial estimate of $100m in 2019 (as evidenced in MBTA HS32PS01) to $571M in 2022 (FY23 CIP) and $1.1B in 2024 (FY25 CIP). \r\n\r\nAdditionally all documents, drawings and other materials submitted to the United States Department of Transportation in support of the MBTA / MassDOTs most recent application to the MEGA grant program for the same Draw 1 project.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJeffrey Lin",
