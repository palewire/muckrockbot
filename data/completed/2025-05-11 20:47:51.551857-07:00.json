CBP's Notification to CRCL re the Death of Narendra Kayastha\r\nA notification by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to DHS-CRCL reporting the in-custody death of Narendra Kayastha, an 80 year-old Indian man who died around 7 pm on November 26, 2021, at 4945 Governors Drive in Forest Park, Georgia, while in CBP custody for an immigration inspection. \r\n\r\nCBP's Death notification policy required CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility to notify CRCL through the Privacy and Diversity Office. Page 5. https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2021-Sep/2021_notification-review-procedures-for-certain-deaths-and-deaths-in-custody%20%283%29.pdf. \r\n\r\nCBP's press website did not post notification of Kayastha's death to its public website, and has not acknowledged this death publicly. \r\n\r\n2. CBP's Significant Event Notification (SEN) or Significant Incident Report (SIR) re the Death of Narendra Kayastha\r\nThe CBP-Atlanta SEN or SIR for Mr. Kayastha's death. \r\n\r\nWe respectfully request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), and make the following statements in support thereof under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n1. Narendra Kayastha died in CBP custody during an inspection for immigration violations around 7pm on November 26, 2021 in Forest Park, Georgia. See: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24413601/cbp-2023-083502_opr_recordpdf.pdf (row 5). \r\n2. Mr. Kayastha was witnessed going unresponsive and medical help was contacted, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's autopsy report. See https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24674455/2021-1037549-0001.pdf (page 2). \r\n3. CBP did not release a public statement regarding Mr. Kayastha's in-custody death, as required by the agency's death notification policy. https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2021-Sep/2021_notification-review-procedures-for-certain-deaths-and-deaths-in-custody%20%283%29.pdf \r\n4. The public has no information regarding what prompted Mr. Kaystha to become unresponsive, how long it took to provide him medical care, or whether he received appropriate care once a provider was contacted. \r\n5. The address CBP recorded for Mr. Kayastha's death is not a hospital emergency department--it is an outpatient, walk-in clinic called Southside Medical Center. https://southsidemedical.net/forest-park/. \r\n6. There is an urgency to inform the public about this alleged federal government activity, and I am a journalist primarily engaged in the dissemination of information.  Specifically, the public has a right to know immediately how Mr. Kayastha died in government custody, why CBP failed to notify the press, and why he was not transported to a higher level care facility. \r\n7. The absence of a public statement by CBP regarding Mr. Kayastha's death reflects an apparent instance of noncompliance with CBP's death notification policy that was in effect at the time.  There is an urgent to need to inform the public regarding why and how this apparently noncompliant death response occurred.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "Andrew Free \r\nN/A \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR164180 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\n01/28/2025 \r\n\r\nCBP-FO-2024-114173 \r\n\r\nDear Andrew Free: \r\n\r\nA search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request CBP-FO-2024-114173, requesting records maintained by CBP. \r\n\r\nCBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below: \r\n\r\nExemption Summary: \r\n(b)(6) \r\nPursuant to exemption  (b)(6), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 3 pages in part. \r\nPermits withholding of records and information about individuals when disclosure would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n(b)(7)(C) \r\nPursuant to exemption  (b)(7)(C), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 3 pages in part. \r\nPermits withholding of records when an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy could reasonably be expected. \r\n(b)(7)(E) \r\nPursuant to exemption  (b)(7)(E), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 3 pages in part. \r\nPermits withholding of records when techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or process would be disclosed or provided such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of law. \r\n\r\nPursuant to DHS Instruction 262-11-004, FOIA Officers at DHS have been instructed to withhold personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) of DHS personnel unless a determination is made that the disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns, or if those concerns are outweighed by any public interest in that information. This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately 0 pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-114173 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe have received your request for officer deployment records related to the LASAN CARE+ and RESET operations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to Deployment records, specifically names and number of officers involved, to the extent the record exists, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to hourly costs, please refer to the City Controller's website at the following link:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayroll Explorer\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Department of Finance has conducted a good faith search for the records you requested and the responsive record located is attached. We have attached our \"Government Crime Insurance\" policy, which is what we believe you mean when you say \"criminal\" insurance. This policy has been renewed with the same conditions as of 5/1/25, but we do not yet have the new policy in hand. Also below is an email sent for the same request dated March 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe Denver Clerk and Recorder would most likely be the custodian of any additional records within the scope of your request, and you may submit requests to that office if you wish to do so. You can find contact information for them at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Clerk-and-Recorder/find-records/CORA\r\n\r\nThis response is governed by the Colorado Open Records Act and applies only to records in the custody of the Department of Finance.

The training you reference on page 10 of lists ICE's training for 2018, since our FOIA Offices are decentralized we would need to refer this item 1 to ICE and consequently Item 2 which is clearly linked to Item 1. \r\nThis page also talks about trainings the Privacy Office hosted that were carried out by OGIS, DOJ, ASAP and the Graduate School. Are you interested in those ? We needed some clarification as to what it is that you are interested in. We will place these two items on hold until we receive clarification from you on this. 1. All DHS FOIA policy and training materials referenced on Page 10 of the DHS Chief Privacy Officer's 2018 Chief FOIA Officer Report: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2018%20Chief%20FOIA%20Officer%20Report.pdf (https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2018%20Chief%20FOIA%20Officer%20Report.pdf) 2.

We consent to that. \r\n\r\nIf the other offices\u2019 trainings referenced on page 10 won\u2019t be likely to be stored by ICE FOIA, or if DHS FOIA has them, maybe you can retain and task only that portion of the request? I\u2019d consent to that as well. \r\n\r\nFinally, I can file a cloned request with ICE FOIA and spare the referral from you all, allowing you to administratively close this request and remove it from your queue, if you believe DHS FOIA has no responsive records. \r\n\r\nReally appreciate your follow up.  Please let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nAndrew",

Your request was received in this office on January 13, 2022.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Requesters seeking responsive records from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are encouraged to create a DHS FOIA Public Access Link (PAL) account at: https://foiarequest.dhs.gov. Creating a PAL account will allow you to directly submit your FOIA request to ICE and track the status of your request. In PAL, you can view your prior PAL submissions, sent correspondences, and responsive records. Although PAL is preferred, ICE FOIA will continue to accept FOIA requests via email at ICE-FOIA@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Freedom of Information Act Office, 500 12th St. SW, STOP 5009, Washington, DC 20536-5009.\r\n\r\n \r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n \r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.\r\n\r\n   \r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2022-ICFO-07344. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. To check the status of an ICE FOIA/PA request, please visit http://www.dhs.gov/foia-status. Please note that to check the status of a request, you must enter the 2022-ICFO-07344 tracking number. If you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the FOIA office. You may send an e-mail to ice-foia@ice.dhs.gov, call toll free (866) 633-1182, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Marcus Francis, in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office\r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\r\nFreedom of Information Act Office\r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009\r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009\r\nTelephone: 1-866-633-1182\r\nVisit our FOIA website at www.ice.gov/foia",

You have requested all DHS FOIA policy and training materials referenced on Page 10 of the DHS Chief Privacy Officer's 2018 Chief FOIA Officer Report: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2018 Chief FOIA Officer Report.pdf, as well as all subsequent versions of FOIA policy and training materials provided to DHS FOIA personnel and DHS agency components\u2019 FOIA personnel AFTER 2018 DHS Chief Privacy Officer\u2019s FOIA report and BEFORE December 21, 2021. \n\nICE has considered your request under both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  Information about an individual that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records may be accessed by that individual unless the agency has exempted the system of records from the access provisions of the Privacy Act. \n\nICE has conducted a search of the ICE Office of Regulatory Affairs and Policy (ORAP) for records responsive to your request and no records responsive to your request were found. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within the above mentioned ICE office(s).  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of the original response letter, within 90 days of the date of the letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.  You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 and refer to your tracking number. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

NARA Open FOIA Requests and Appeals FY 2023\r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply.\r\n\r\nRECORDS SOUGHT VIA FOIA.\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 24-A.D.MUCK. NARA Open FOIA Requests and Appeals FY 2023. See PDF.\r\n\r\n1.\tFOIA logs or logs by any other name containing records of all FOIA requests and appeals that were received or remained open from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 (FY 2023).\r\na.\tI am seeking logs in MS Excel format if available.\r\nb.\tThe data may be contained in one contiguous log or a combination of logs for prior fiscal years. Nevertheless, I am seeking all data.\r\n2.\tData that I am seeking for each FOIA request or appeal, which is in the Agency\u2019s custody, includes:\r\na. Tracking number of the request (unique individualized FOIA tracking number).\r\nb. Date of the request. \r\nc. Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \r\nd. Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request. \r\ne. Subject matter of the request. f. Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.). \r\ng. Date the request was perfected. \r\nh. The result of each FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni. Exemptions cited, if any. \r\nj. Date on which the request was resolved. \r\nk. Fee category assigned to requester (commercial, educational, news media, other). \r\nl. Whether a fee waiver was requested. \r\nm. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted. \r\nn. Fees charged to the requester, if any. \r\no. Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well. \r\np. Whether expedited processing was requested.\r\nq. Whether expedited processing was granted.\r\n\r\n3.\tNote that past \u201cFOIA Logs\u201d posted to NARA\u2019s website do not contain all this data. NARA has other records responsive to my FOIA request. \r\n\r\n4.\tNote that past \u201cFOIA Logs\u201d posted to NARA\u2019s website only identify FOIA requests and appeals received during the current fiscal year and do not account for prior year requests and appeals that may have been completed during a subsequent fiscal year or remain open.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\n\r\n6.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n\r\n7.\tThe Agency copy of this FOIA Request this FOIA request itself is an agency record, \u201creceived by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied). \r\n\r\n\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d  44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nThe Webex recording link should also be included in the FOIA Advisory Committee meeting minutes. Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tNARA\u2019s alleged past massive false FOIA reporting is great public interest.\r\nb.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\nc.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public- comments\r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change. See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01- agencies-must-provide-edcs .\r\n\r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY. This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved.

Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n",

Stern\r\nNARA's General Counsel\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n301-837-1750 (phone)\r\n301-837-0293 (fax)\r\ngarym.stern@nara.gov;\r\nngc.foia.liaison@nara.gov; \r\nFOIA@nara.gov \r\n\r\nSubject: FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) Dispute Resolution - NGC24-147\r\n\r\nGary Stern (NARA FOIA Public Liaison)\r\n\r\nI am seeking immediate, written FOIA Public Liaison Dispute Resolution of NARA\u2019s expedited processing denial for the above FOIA request. Records are located at https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/nara-24-cmuck-nara-open-foia-requests-and-appeals-fy-2023-157540/\r\n\r\nFPL dispute resolution is not optional \u2013 it is mandatory per the FOIA statute- as a non-exclusive alternative to other redress. NARA must engage in the disputes that I identify and not defer to previous determinations as definitive.\r\n\r\nI am seeking that NARA address every element and sub-element of my request for expedited processing. NARA must address all elements and to deny expedited processing NARA must reject every element/sub-element.\r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s generalized statement, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing your request, we do not believe expedition is warranted, as you have not demonstrated that your request meets the above-referenced criteria\u201d does not comport with law.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARA Unlawful Expedited Processing Pattern or Practice. NARA has the worst FOIA statistics in the federal government. NARA did not PROCESS any requests for expedited processing in FY 2022 despite claiming to have granted 58 and denied 329. NARA does not show any pending expedited processing requests in queue for FY 2022.  nara-fy22.pdf (archives.gov) https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/nara-fy22.pdf \r\nVII.A.\r\nVII.B.\r\nVII.C.\r\nVII.D.\r\nVIII.A.\r\na.\tThere is both internal inconsistency in NARA\u2019s FY 2022 data and inconsistency with its FY 2021 Annual FOIA report. https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/reports/nara-fy21-final.pdf \r\nb.\tNARA failed miserably in its last FOIA audit in 2017, including submitting massively false/unreliable FOIA reports. Things have gotten much worse. https://www.archives.gov/files/oig/reports/audit-report-17-AUD-16.pdf \r\nc.\tNARA\u2019s quarterly and Annual FOIA Reports are massively false based on written public comments that I have posted.\r\nd.\tNARA cannot again submit for FY 2023 a materially false Annual FOIA report, nor can DOJ OIP accept such a knowingly false annual FOIA report based on written public comments alone. (See public comments list attached.).\r\ne.\tA NARA OIG audit of FOIA funding and compliance is needed.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n",
