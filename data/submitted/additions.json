Paul St Surin\r\n2. Kristopher Bielecki\r\n3. Jairo Palacios\r\n4. Tony Tiburzi\r\n5. Troy Horton-Jones\r\n6. David Weldon\r\n7. Mamadou Bah\r\n8. Nevin Nolte\r\n9. Matthew Banocy\r\n10. Morgan Banocy\r\n11. Zachary Ruhling\r\n12. Walter Holleman\r\n13. Cole Hofmann\r\n14. William Healey\r\n15. Tyler Coss Y Leon\r\n\r\n- Complete investigative files for each complaint, including but not limited to reports of recorded statements, video surveillance or body camera footage, investigative files, witness interviews, and photographs.\r\n- The investigative findings of each complaint.\r\n- Any correspondence from the Civilian Review Board, Police Accountability Board, Administrative Charging Committee or other civilian police oversight board.\r\n- The final disposition of each case, if any.\r\n\r\n****As with previous requests of this nature,  we will accept disciplinary history summaries -- to include ALL closed and pending complaints -- for all of the officers listed for the time being.****\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Public Information Act requires that the requested information be forwarded within ten (10) days. Pursuant to General Provisions \u00a7 4-203(b)(2), if it will take more than 10 working days to produce the requested records, we must be notified, in writing or by email, of that fact. If the records are not able to be produced within 10 days, you may request an extension up to thirty (30) days.  If access to any or all records described above is denied, please identify in a written statement the general content of each item being withheld. Additionally, \u00a7 4-203 (a) and (c) of the General Provisions Article requires you to provide in writing grounds for denial, citing legal authority under which you may deny access.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.  Alternatively, please consider waiving any fees, pursuant to \u00a7 4-206(e)(2)(ii) of the General Provisions Article, as this request is on behalf of individuals served by the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, a state government agency, which solely serves indigent citizens of Maryland.  As a result, my request for the above-listed public records is in the public interest.  I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDeborah Levi\r\nDirector of Special Litigation\r\nMaryland Office of the Public Defender\r\n(443) 272-1068",
