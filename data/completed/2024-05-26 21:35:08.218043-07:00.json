Dkt. AP 2015-2148 (Pa. O.O.R. Oct. 27, 2015); Spatz\r\nv. City of Reading, O.O.R. Dkt. AP 2013-0867, 2013 PA O.O.R.D. Lexis 513. The City has interpreted your request as seeking the Citywide email sent to staff on May 20, 2024 announcing a transition to in-person work starting July 15, 2025. To the extent you intended to seek other records, your request is denied as insufficiently specific. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.\u00a0  \u00a0     Your request does not specify a transaction or activity of the City, but rather seeks all email from more than 25,000 City employees for a period of nearly 1.5 years with broad search terms.\u00a0Among other things, the RTKL requires that a written request\u00a0\u201cidentify or describe the records sought with sufficient\r\nspecificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested\r\n. . . .\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.**\u00a0The requirement of specificity is necessary to (1) ensure that a requestor provides enough information so that \u201can agency can determine whether to grant or deny the request[;]\u201d\u00a0Nanayakkara v. Casella,\r\n681 A.2d 857, 859-60 (Pa. Commw. 1996), and (2) \u201cto prevent agencies from suffering undue interference and obstruction of their daily functions; . . . [which] would be unavoidable if agency officials always could be subjected to broad and unlimited requests for documents and records.\u201d\u00a0Mooney v. Temple Univ. of the Commonwealth Sys. Of Higher Educ. Bd. Of\r\nTrustees, 292 A.2d 395, 397 n.8 (Pa. 1972) (\u201crequests for inspection [must] be specific and particular seeking disclosure of named documents or records rather than broad and unlimited requests for undefined bodies of documents or records\u201d);\u00a0see also, e.g.,\u00a0Arduino v. Borough of Dunmore, 720 A.2d 827, 831 (Pa. Commw. 1998) (holding that a request for \u201c\u2018all records\u2019 related to the disbursement of the funds for [certain] public projects\u201d lacked sufficient specificity),\u00a0appeal denied, 741 A.2d 195 (Pa. 1992);\u00a0Hunt. v. Pa.\r\nDep\u2019t of Corr., 698 A.2d 147, 149 (Pa. Commw. 1997) (holding that requests,\r\nincluding a request for all documents given by Department of Corrections to\r\ninmate and by inmate to Department, lacked sufficient specificity).  \u00a0  Pennsylvania courts have compared such broad, sweeping requests to discovery-type requests which, while potentially proper in the context of civil litigation, are improper under the RTKL. Berman v. Pa. Convention Ctr. Auth., 901 A.2d 1085, 1089 (Pa. Commw. 2006) (holding that request for \u201c\u2018[t]he most recent plans, construction, and design documents\u2019 relating to\u201d the convention center expansion was \u201cmore in the nature of a discovery request than a proper request for public records\u201d); Associated\r\nBuilders and Contractors, Inc. v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Gen Servs., 747 A.2d 962, 965-66 (Pa. Commw. 2000) (holding that requests \u201cakin to document requests under the civil discovery rules, i.e., \u2018any and all documents relating to [subject matter]\u2019\u201d lack sufficient specificity); accord PSP v. OOR, 995\r\nA.2d. 515, 517 (Pa. Commw. 2010) (\u201cThe portion of the request seeking any and\r\nall records, files or communications [concerning subject matter] is\r\ninsufficiently specific for the PSP to respond to the request.\u201d). Such broad\r\nrequests have been, and will be, denied.  \u00a0  It would place an unreasonable burden on the City to go through all of its records for an extended period of time without knowing, with sufficient specificity, what type of records are being sought. Cf. Mollick v. Twp. of Worcester, 32\r\nA.3d 859, 871 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2011) (holding that requests seeking emails\r\nbetween certain agency officials and employees for the past one and five years\r\nwithout sufficiently identifying the subject matter were insufficiently\r\nspecific, and concluding that \u201cit would place an unreasonable burden on an\r\nagency to examine all its emails for an extended time period without knowing,\r\nwith sufficient specificity, what Township business or activity the request is\r\nrelated [to].\u201d) \u200b       This correspondence will close your request with our office as permitted by law.  Respectfully,     Feige\r\nM. Grundman  Pronouns:\r\nshe/her  \u00a0  Chief Deputy City Solicitor  Right to Know Unit  City\r\nof Philadelphia Law Department  One Parkway Building, 17th Floor  1515 Arch Street  Philadelphia, PA 19102   \u00a0  *Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right to Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.101 et seq. In accordance with RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires use of the standard statewide Right to Know Form for the submission of written requests pursuant to RTKL (\u201cRTK Requests\u201d). See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file an RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Commw. 2012). This policy is available online at https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/ To the extent you intended to submit an RTK Request, your request is denied as you have not complied with the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a RTK Request pursuant to RTKL and has processed it as an informal\u00a0request. The City nonetheless referred to RTKL for guidance in determining whether records should be released in response to your request.     ** This language is identical to the sufficient specificity requirement in \u00a7 2(c) of the prior Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. 66.1, et seq. Accordingly, the case law interpreting this language in the context of the old Right-to-Know Law remains binding. Dep't of Conservation & Natural Res. v. Office of Open Records, 1 A.3d 929, 940-41 (Pa. Commw. 2010) (interpreting language in the new Act by relying on prior precedent holding that \u201c[t]he language in the two definitions is virtually identical. Faced with a prior judicial interpretation . . . .by . . . the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of the account/voucher/contract language in the RTKL, even though issued in the context of the Old Law, we are not at liberty here to ascribe a different meaning to the same language.\u201d).\u00a0    \r\n                           \r\n                            On\r\n                            Tue, May 21 at  4:08 PM\r\n                            ,  City of Philadelphia Right to Know <righttoknow@phila.gov>  wrote:\r\n                             THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA     Dear 164074-30279347@requests. muckrock. com,     Thank you for your correspondence.

Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub.

If they are not, it is explosive.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public- comments\r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020\tAccess and disclosure request files.

NARA must address all elements and to deny expedited processing NARA must reject every element/sub-element.\r\n\u2022\tNARA\u2019s generalized statement, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing your request, we do not believe expedition is warranted, as you have not demonstrated that your request meets the above-referenced criteria\u201d does not comport with law.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOJ OIP Compliance Inquiry and NARA OIG Request for Audit.\r\n\r\nPlease address above and below.\r\n\r\nNARA repeats the exact same wording to every request for expedited processing, never evaluating all elements of such requests. \r\n\r\nNARA has the worst FOIA statistics in the federal government. NARA did not PROCESS any requests for expedited processing in FY 2022 despite claiming to have granted 58 and denied 329. NARA does not show any pending expedited processing requests in queue for FY 2022. \r\n\r\nnara-fy22.pdf (archives.gov) https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/nara-fy22.pdf \r\n\r\nVII.A.\r\nVII.B.\r\nVII.C.\r\nVII.D.\r\nVIII.A.\r\n\r\nThere is both internal inconsistency in NARA\u2019s FY 2022 data and inconsistency with its FY 2021 Annual FOIA report.\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/files/foia/reports/nara-fy21-final.pdf \r\n\r\nNARA failed miserably its last FOIA audit in 2017, including then submitting massively false/unreliable FOIA reports. Things have gotten much worse. https://www.archives.gov/files/oig/reports/audit-report-17-AUD-16.pdf \r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s quarterly and Annual FOIA Reports are massively false based on written public comments that I have posted.\r\n\r\nNARA cannot again submit for FY 2023 a materially false Annual FOIA report, nor can DOJ OIP accept such a knowingly false annual FOIA report based on written public comments alone. (See public comments list attached.).\r\n\r\nA NARA OIG audit of FOIA funding and compliance is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIA Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nFYSA regarding model determination letters and the requirement to articulate the specific reason for any denial. See PDF attached regarding NARA\u2019s impermissible pattern of practice for all expedited processing denials.\r\n\r\nNARA denied my request for expedited processing within minutes of purportedly receiving my request. \r\n\r\nRecords sought concern the FOIA Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Gary Stern <garym.stern@nara.gov> \r\nSent: Thursday, January 25, 2024 11:18 AM\r\nTo: perseverance2013@aol.com\r\nCc: ngc.foia.liaison@nara.gov; foia@nara.gov; joseph.a.scanlon@nara.gov; joseph.scanlon@nara.gov; archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov; execsec@nara.gov\r\nSubject: Re: Immediate FPL Dispute Resolution Freedom of Information Act Request NGC24-130.

NARA must engage in the disputes that I identify and not defer to previous determinations as definitive.\r\n\r\nI am seeking that NARA address every element and sub-element of my request for expedited processing. NARA must address all elements and to deny expedited processing NARA must reject every element/sub-element.\r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s generalized statement, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing your request, we do not believe expedition is warranted, as you have not demonstrated that your request meets the above-referenced criteria\u201d does not comport with law.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\nNARA Unlawful Expedited Processing Pattern or Practice.

Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe request any spreadsheets, logs, data, or other similar documents maintained by ILEA sufficient to show the following information regarding law enforcement officers who receive basic training waivers in IN due to their previous certification in other states. Specifically, please provide as many of the following data points as are maintained:\r\n\r\n- Unique ID\r\n- Name\r\n- Previous state that the officer was previously certified by\r\n- Date of IN certification\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nInvisible Institute",

You can listen to them if you have any questions. \r\n\r\n(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a state or local law enforcement agency shall make public the information described in paragraph (2), except to the extent that disclosure of a particular item of information would endanger the safety of a person involved in an investigation or would endanger the successful completion of the investigation or a related investigation.  \r\n\r\nVanessa Holton is in no danger from me if her name is listed as the victim,  I already know who filed the complaint.  Besides the two voice mails, I spoke with Officer Bellamy twice and Lt. Bishop. Each clearly stated it was Vanessa Holton who filed the report as the General Counsel of the State Bar of California.\r\n\r\nAs Charly Taylor stated my \"alleged\" offense was building a website to harass and defame her. He also indicated that the complaint was closed without referral. \r\n\r\nAs you have not provided any proper legal reasoning for withholding her name, I again ask that you comply with section (a)(1) and list her name as the alleged victim.  Failure to include her name can infer my alleged offense was of a sexual nature.\r\n\r\nReverend Frank Robinson\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The fee and fee waiver\r\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), however, do not apply\r\nto archival records. The FOIA fee section states that \"Nothing in this\r\nsubparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically\r\nproviding for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.\"\r\n[5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(vi)]. Accordingly, the NARA fee statute, 44 U.S.C.\r\n2116(c), and implementing regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 1258, apply\r\nexclusively to your request, under which the National Archives does not\r\nwaive reproduction charges for individual requesters. Our inability to\r\ngrant you the requested fee waiver does not constitute a denial for the\r\npurposes of the FOIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request.  However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attached enclosure.  If you have any\r\nquestions, you may reach us at archives2reference@nara.gov.

Any declassified documents, reports, or communications regarding the USS\r\nLiberty incident.\r\n2. Transcripts of communications between the USS Liberty and any U.S.\r\ngovernment entity on the day of the incident.\r\n3. Records of any investigations conducted by U.S. agencies into the\r\nincident.\r\n4. Correspondences between U.S. government officials discussing the\r\nincident in the aftermath of June 8, 1967.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from\r\ndisclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt\r\nportions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is\r\nexempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and\r\nprovision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records\r\npotentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or\r\ndestruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes\r\na violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in\r\nKissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136,\r\n150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this\r\nrequest. As an independent investigative journalist associated with\r\nTransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the\r\npublic interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public\r\nunderstanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges\r\nin excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me\r\nin advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty\r\nbusiness days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including\r\nincoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on\r\nMuckRock.com.

His birth month/year was November 1953; report of his death was published in April 2020. His longtime residence was in Brooklyn, NY (Kings County). The NYS Attorney Registration Database lists his attorney registration number as 2621670.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System including  (but not limited to) the Counterdrug Information Indices System (CIIS), ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\nWe are following up with you regarding your public records request submitted to this agency. Your request is attached.\r\nBased on the breadth of the specific request, this office has identified over 13,000 pages that may be responsive. These records may include documents containing information that is confidential and exempt from section 119.07(1), Florida Statutes, and section 24(a), article I of the Florida Constitution. For example, materials that were prepared by an agency attorney or prepared at the attorney\u2019s direction that reflect mental impressions, conclusions, litigation strategy, or legal theories of the attorney or agency prepared in anticipation of litigation are exempt from production pursuant to section 119.071(1)(d), Florida Statutes.\r\nConsequently, your specific requests will require an extensive use of agency personnel and time, as well as information technology resources, to retrieve and review the documents responsive to your request and ensure compliance with the exemptions under section 119.071, Florida Statutes, and applicable law. Therefore, an initial labor deposit is being assessed pursuant to section 119.07(4)(d), Florida Statutes for 50 percent of the total cost estimate, at an initial labor deposit of $1,561.58 Please note that we estimate these requests may require multiple hours or more of review at appropriate hourly rates.  The actual hourly rate of the lowest hourly rate of the employee capable of performing the work needed to comply with these public records requests will be assessed against the initial labor charge.\r\nPursuant to Florida Public Records Act, section 119.07(4), Florida Statutes, please provide us with a check in the total amount of $1,561.58 made payable to Executive Office of the Governor and sent to my attention at 400 S Monroe Street, Suite 209, Tallahassee, FL 32399.\r\nUpon receipt of the aforementioned check, this office will begin to review responsive records. Once the responsive records have been reviewed, this office will send you an additional invoice for the remainder of the cost required to produce the documents. Upon receipt of payment in full, we will forward to you the documents responsive to your request. Due to the scope of your public records request, we estimate that the production of these records will take an extensive amount of time to complete.\r\nPlease note that if this office does not receive a response within thirty (30) days from the date of this letter, we will close out your specific requests as non-responsive. Please do not hesitate to contact this office in the event that you would like to discuss your current request, or if you would like to narrow it in any fashion.\r\nSincerely,\r\nOffice of Open Government\n",

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A copy of the April 25, 2024 memo or letter to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, as reported at https://www.kxan.com/news/leaked-memo-reveals-inside-details-of-uts-protest-response/ \r\n\r\n2. Any draft version (in its native format) of the memo. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Funiversity-texas-austin-383%252Fmemo-to-palestine-solidarity-committee-at-ut-austin-162735%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicinformationrequest%252540austin.utexas.edu&url_auth_token=AAAe-Fb3m9LQGURzcDkrsDJDO2Y%3A1s1GN1%3AVG0VPzouI7L_XMQ9gKL9TwEaBZEZZ2WefvXK5OpqUx0 \r\n \r\nSection 552.222 of the Texas Public Information Act permits a governmental body to ask a requestor to clarify or narrow a request for information if the request is unclear or if a large amount of information has been requested. The purpose of this letter is to ask that you clarify or narrow your request by providing us with more information about the particular records you seek. The following paragraph highlights the aspect of your request that we find to be unclear or overly broad. \r\n \r\nThe document being referred to as a \"memo\" in that KXAN article seems to be the internally-circulated talking points document that KXAN posted online here: https://twitter.com/RyanChandlerTV/status/1783887440152756489. This is not a memo and was not sent to the Palestine Solidarity Committee. \r\n\r\nIn light of these facts, we ask that you please clarify what document you are looking for with this request. Are you looking for the talking points \"memo\" that the KXAN article is referencing, a document that was sent to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, communicating their interim suspension, or something else? \r\n \r\nPlease let us know how you wish to proceed. Upon receipt of your response, we will resume work on your request.\u00a0 You may deliver your response by replying to this email or by any one of the following means: \r\n \r\nBy U.S. Mail: \r\nAttn:\u00a0 Open Records Coordinator \r\nOffice of the Vice President for Legal Affairs \r\nThe University of Texas at Austin \r\nP.O.

Specifically, I am requesting records regarding the FBI's handling of FOIA request guidelines and search programs, including keystring searches and searches used for interagency communication requests for digital memos, documents, emails, or paper documents on related subjects.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to reference the following relevant case law:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989): This case established the fundamental purpose of FOIA as providing the public with access to information that the government may not otherwise make available.\r\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Department of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2014): This case held that agencies must disclose any reasonably segregable portion of a record that is not exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\r\nNat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case established that agencies must provide a specific and legitimate justification for withholding any requested information.\r\nMilner v. Dep't of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011): This case held that agencies cannot withhold information under FOIA unless the requested information falls within a specific exemption.\r\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004): This case held that agencies must conduct an adequate search for requested information under FOIA.\r\nI kindly request any records, including policies, procedures, manuals, and training materials, that outline the FBI's guidelines and procedures for conducting searches in response to FOIA requests. I also request any records that detail the types of search programs or techniques utilized by the FBI in its FOIA search process, including keystring searches and interagency communication requests.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I kindly request any records, including digital memos, documents, emails, or paper documents, related to the FBI's handling of FOIA requests and search programs. These records should include any guidance provided to FBI personnel regarding the handling of FOIA requests and the methods used to search for responsive records.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the FBI has an obligation to provide the requested records unless they are exempt under FOIA. If the FBI withholds any requested records or deletes any responsive information, it must provide a detailed explanation for doing so.\r\n\r\nI kindly request expedited processing of this request, as the information sought is of great public interest and urgency. If expedited processing is not possible, please process this request in the normal course.\r\n\r\nFinally, if any portion of my request is denied, please provide the specific legal basis for the denial, including the FOIA exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf my request is denied in whole or in part, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the disclosure of the requested information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

While I understand the denial of expedited processing, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that the FBI's search procedures and protocols used in response to my FOIPA request were inadequate and incomplete.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that the FBI has not conducted an adequate search for responsive documents. The FBI's search must be reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. However, I have reason to believe that the search conducted was not thorough and did not encompass all locations where responsive documents may exist.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the search conducted by the FBI is demonstrated in the fact that no responsive documents were provided in response to my request. This leads me to believe that the search procedures and protocols used were insufficient in locating any responsive documents. As such, I request that the FBI conduct a new search for responsive documents using more comprehensive search procedures and protocols.\r\n\r\nI also request that the FBI provide me with a detailed explanation of the search procedures and protocols used in response to my request. Additionally, I request that the FBI provide me with information regarding the locations searched for responsive documents and the search terms used to identify responsive documents.\r\n\r\nTo support my request for a more comprehensive search, I would like to refer to several court cases that have upheld the principle that government agencies must conduct a search that is reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. In Tax Analysts v. United States Department of Justice, 845 F.2d 1060, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court held that \"the search must be reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents,\" and that \"the failure of an agency to uncover all relevant documents can be evidence that the search was not reasonably calculated.\" Similarly, in Weisberg v. United States Department of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the court held that the agency's search must be \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that the FBI conduct a more comprehensive search for responsive documents, and provide me with the requested information regarding the search procedures and protocols used. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

The request includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccopies of all records\u2026concerning the following UNCC employee Carolyn Keith (ckeith11@uncc.edu) and in connection with: Patrick Bourke (PBourke@eda.gov); Steve Kalland (steve_kalland@ncsu.edu); Allison Carr (akcarr@ncsu.edu); Samantha Gibson (sgibson3@ncsu.edu); Frank Avery (FAvery@eda.gov); Peter Ledford (peter.ledford@nc.gov); Eric Muth (ermuth@ncat.edu); Caroline Finklea Sullivan (caroline.sullivan@nc.gov); Andrea DeSantis (andrea.desantis@nc.gov); Jennifer Mundt (Jennifer.Mundt@commerce.nc.gov); Chet Mottershead (chet.mottershead@commerce.nc.gov); Machelle Sanders (machelle.sanders@commerce.nc.gov); Rob Cox (rcox3@uncc.edu, robert.cox@charlotte.edu); Robert (Bob) Powell (rpow426@gmail.com, rpowell@ncat.edu); Ward Lenz (ward@energync.org); Deb Wojcik (Deb@researchtrianglecleantech.org)\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ms. Keith\u2019s emails in connection with the following email domains: @ncat.edu, @ncsu.edu, @uncc.edu, @charlotte.edu, @nc.gov, @appstate.edu, @advancedenergy.org, @commerce.nc.gov, @researchtrianglecleantech.org, @ncat.edu, @ncsu.edu, @uncc.edu, @charlotte.edu, @nc.gov, @appstate.edu, @advancedenergy.org, @commerce.nc.gov, @researchtrianglecleantech.org. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFor records including but not limited to emails, text messages, phone call logs, phone call notes, video call logs, video call notes, notes referencing phone calls or video calls, social media posts, documentation, notes, emails, prepared agendas, meeting schedules during work hours or after, whether onsite or offsite, and whether on university equipment or personal devices.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we received your request, we began analyzing the full scope of this request, including the hours and personnel required to fulfill the request.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first request, after running an email search between Ms. Carolyn Keith and the sixteen (16) individual domains listed in the first part of your request, it returned over 3,600 emails. We anticipate it will take approximately fifty (50) hours for review for responsiveness related to this part of the request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part of your request (#2 above) resulted in over 19,000 emails, which would result in hundreds of hours of review. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third part of your request (#3 above) is being processed and we will provide you with an estimate or charges once we review the extensiveness of the records. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile UNC Charlotte has every intention of complying with our statutory public records obligations, we have determined that your request requires extensive clerical and supervisory staff. The basis for this determination is the scope of this request, including reviewing over 22,000 emails. According to University Policy 605.8 (available at\u00a0http://legal.uncc.edu/policies/up-605.8), this expenditure of time constitutes \u201cextensive clerical and supervisory assistance\u201d as defined by North Carolina Gen. Stat. \u00a7132-6.2.\u00a0Since your request is considered extraordinary, it will incur a special charge at a presumptive rate of $18 per hour applied after the fourth hour of work on the request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of the request, would you like to revise or narrow the search, especially the first and second parts of your request? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to proceed with your request by Monday, May 6, 2024. We will resume per your direction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss, I\u2019m available at (704) 687-8592. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTina Dadio\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at UNC Charlotte.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

If we exceed four (4) hours for this search, we will provide you with an estimate of charges prior to completing the review.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this time does not include the compilation and review for responsiveness of text messages, notes, or other documents related to your request (initial request #3).\r\n\r\nPlease confirm if you wish us to proceed with this review by May 10.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request all records within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice (DOJ) within the time frame of 2017 to 2023, to be the day on which this request is processed, and with respect to the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Records that detail if or what manner the fourth amendment may apply in the context of a private employer compelling employees to submit to reasonable suspicion testing given the direct nexus of SAMHSA, when it is known that such private employer complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, if such records exist within the DOJ\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the volume (ie, numerically) of civil rights complaints in the context of employment that fall outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n3. Records that detail how the DOJ Civil Rights Division separates out potential civil rights violations in the context of employment if such civil rights violations fall outside the scope of the EEOC. Additionally, I request, if known to the DOJ, what agency is most appropriate if a civil rights violation occurs in the context of employment but falls outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail how a private employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the federal government, or acting under the direction of the federal government under the pretense of reasonable suspicion testing per the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and given the direct nexus to SAMHSA under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. Records related to the handling of fictitious or materially false statements to federal government agencies made by private employers.\r\n\r\n3. Records related to if or in what manner a private employer, if such private employer can be proven to be acting on behalf of the federal government, can conspire against rights (in oppressing an employee\u2019s civil rights) and the distinction between a civil and criminal manner pertaining to conspiracy against rights, if any such record exists.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to a private employer and consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions to such private employer when intentionally abusing or defrauding the United States (ie, a Federal Government Agency) and in what manner it can be said to be so, according to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n5. Records related to remedy available to employees when civil rights can be meaningfully construed to have been violated by a private employer, if such records exist.\r\n\r\n6. The most appropriate agency for which an employee may seek remedy for civil rights violations by a private employer, if not the DOJ Civil Rights Division or DOJ Criminal Division, and if known to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate an approximate time frame for this request to be processed. Depending on the time frame for the request to be fulfilled and any fees that may be incurred, I may revise the criteria.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",

        "communication": "Hi Megan, \r\nThank you again so much for all this important data!\r\n\r\nMy colleagues and I noticed a new discrepancies in the data that I wonder if you could explain. If it's easier to do on a call with you, or with someone else in your office, we'd appreciate that as well.\r\n\r\n- Tab number 4 doesn't seem to correspond to the summary sheet's #4. The breakdown sheet's tab 4 has grant status as DENIED as opposed to GRANTED and the total is 2962 compared to 198,712.\r\n- For number 2 and 4, why are the orders granted numbers so incredibly high compared to number of petitions filed in #1? Are the orders numbers cumulative in nature meaning each year's data includes all previous years too? Can you please explain how these relate to number of petitions filed?\r\n- Tab 15 is missing from the breakdown sheet\r\n- For a few of the tabs, the totals in the breakdown sheet tabs is much higher than what is listed on the summary page- Tabs 5, 11, 14 & 16\r\n- For a few of the tabs, the totals in the summary sheet is higher by a little (ranging from a few hundred to a handful) but there's no explanation for that.- Tabs 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, & 13\r\n\r\nThank you again for continuing to help with this. We truly appreciate your attention.\r\nAll best,\r\nMackey",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nYou are welcome. When it comes to PFA's, the number variation happens for various reasons. Some expire, some are temporary, some may even be reoccurring or overturned. The unit responsible for gathering the data you requested did it to the best of their ability. The status of a PFA, reasons for PFA's, and relation to firearm permissions is not always the same. Unfortunately, we are not a repository for all law enforcement agencies within Pennsylvania, so we cannot explain all variances in data. The PSP does enter information provided to us, but we do not maintain all records for all petitions.\r\n\r\nThe sheets correlate to the requested information with the exception of what was provided in the letter; \"15. The total number of firearms relinquished to attorneys at law,\" stated in the table,  and \"17. The total number of firearms that were not returned after the expiration of the order because the respondent was prohibited from firearm possession,\" as there is no data in our possession to provide for that.  Beyond the data we have provided we cannot offer much more insight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a wonderful Wednesday and stay safe,\r\n\r\nMegan Rivers-Bunner | Legal Assistant 2 Deputy Agency Open Records Officer\r\nPSP| Bureau of Record and Identification | Right-to-Know Law/Subpoena Section\r\nPSP DHQ | 1800 Elmerton Avenue | Harrisburg, PA 17110\r\n| Fax: 717. 525. 5795 | RTK: 877-785-7771\r\nwww.psp.pa.gov<http://www.psp.pa.gov/>\n",

At least some of the records I am requesting were previously posted on the Department's website (https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm). Although this page has since been removed, I believe that the Department still holds these records. Indeed, I confirmed with the New York State Archives that they have not received any documents relating to the Fast Food Wage Board.\r\n\r\nI ask that you expedite at least the release of the recordings of the 2015 Fast Food Wage Board meetings. Again, these recordings were previously posted on the Department's website, which suggests that they are of considerable interest to the public and do not require any review or redactions by your staff. Your own FOIL guidelines state that the timeline for responding to a request depends on \"the number of documents you request, their format, their availability, the time it takes to redact any information that cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, the time it takes to assemble the documents, and other factors.\" (Quoted from the Process section of https://dol.ny.gov/freedom-information-law-foil-requests). These request-specific factors bely the claim in your extension message that you have an \"obligation to treat each request equally.\" Since the previously public Fast Food Wage Board documents do not need redactions or reformatting, it seems reasonable to expect that you can release them with a minimum of staff time.

The requested records include recordings of\r\npublic hearings and testimony previously available on the DOL website\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm>.\r\nThe\r\ntracking number for my request is R001184-092523.\r\n\r\nI submitted my request on September 25, 2023 but have yet to receive any\r\nrecords or reasonable estimate of when the records will be available\r\n(again). I was initially given an estimate of 20 business days. A month\r\nlater, the estimate was extended by 90 days. After 90 days, it was pushed\r\nback by 30 days. Most recently, I was given another estimate of 90 business\r\ndays. I have attached the full message history related to this request.\r\n\r\nI do not consider the estimates provided to me reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances of the request. It has been over six months since I submitted\r\nmy request and three estimates have expired with no explanation. Please\r\nnote that no redactions or reformatting should be required for records\r\npreviously released in response to Randy Mastro's 2015 FOIL request or\r\npublished to a public webpage. I kindly ask that you provide me with a\r\nreasonable estimate taking into account the nature of my request and the\r\ntime it took the Department to respond to similar recent requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*Peter Fugiel, PhD* | Postdoctoral Research Fellow\r\n\r\nDepartment of Labor Studies and Employment Relations\r\n\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\n",
