        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Peirce Elementary \r\n2. Budlong Elementary \r\n3. Holden Elementary \r\n\r\nTime frame: July 1, 2021 to current \r\n\r\nAdditionally, supply any/all reports related to EOCO complaint settlements and/or resolutions. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal cell phone numbers, employee identification numbers, race/ethnicity, medical information, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Illinois state law prohibits the release of teacher\u00a0performance\u00a0evaluations. Per 105 ILCS 5/24A-7.1, \u201cDisclosure of public school teacher, principal, and superintendent performance evaluations is prohibited,\u201d and 820 ILCS 40/11, \u201cDisclosure of performance evaluations under the Freedom of Information Act shall be prohibited,\u201d and related documents have been removed. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(d) of the FOIA which provides that \u201c[r]ecords in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings\u2026 to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(d)(iv). Certain records were withheld from release as they have been determined to be factual information inextricably intertwined\u00a0with an ongoing\u00a0investigation or disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) and 7(1)(n) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(f) states \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)] Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" (Id. at 248, 799 N.E.2d at 864). Section 7(1)(n) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201cRecords relating to a public body's adjudication of employee grievances or disciplinary cases; however, this exemption shall not extend to the final outcome of cases in which discipline is imposed.\u201d To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

        "communication": "Subject: FOIL Appeal for Denial of Access - Water Quality Complaints in Albany, Schenectady, and Troy MSA (Schenectady County Department of Health)\r\n\r\nDear Records Access Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the constructive denial of access to records that I requested under the New York Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) on March 15, 2023. The request sought records related to water quality complaints and issues within the Albany, Schenectady, and Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) from January 1, 2018, to the present. Although my request was acknowledged by Alissa Foster, Deputy Clerk of the Legislature, on March 21, 2023, I have not received the requested records or any further communication from the Schenectady County Department of Health.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, my original request sought the following information:\r\n\r\n1) The total number of water quality complaints received by your agency/authority/utility, broken down by year.\r\n2) A detailed summary of each water quality complaint, including the date, location, nature of the complaint, any actions taken, and the resolution or current status.\r\n3) Any reports, memos, or other documentation related to water quality complaints, investigations, and resolutions within the specified area and timeframe.\r\n\r\nI understand that local water districts in Schenectady County are required to share information with the Schenectady County Department of Health in situations where water quality issues have the potential to impact public health, such as violations of drinking water standards, waterborne disease outbreaks, public health emergencies, boil water advisories or notices, and monitoring and reporting violations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I recognize that local water districts are required to follow both state and federal regulations when providing information about water quality issues to county departments of health, such as the Schenectady County Department of Health. Some of the key regulations include the State Sanitary Code (10 NYCRR Subpart 5-1), New York State Public Health Law, Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and Clean Water Act (CWA).\r\n\r\nI followed up on my original request with two subsequent emails on April 14, 2023, and May 1, 2023, requesting a response or an update on the status of my request. However, I have not received any acknowledgment or response from the Schenectady County Department of Health.\r\n\r\nThe constructive denial of access to the requested records is in violation of FOIL. I respectfully request that you reconsider my request and provide the requested records or a valid explanation for withholding them within ten business days, as required by FOIL.\r\n\r\nIf my appeal is denied, please provide a written explanation for the denial and inform me of any further appeal procedures available under New York State law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to receiving your response.",

I appreciate the effort in conducting a search for responsive documents related to my request. I understand that the current search yielded 146,371 emails that match the search terms I provided. To assist in reducing the volume of documents and the associated time required for review, I would like to revise and narrow my request as follows:\r\n\r\nPlease limit the search to correspondence involving the following individuals or roles within the South Colonie Central School District:\r\na. Board members\r\nb. Superintendent\r\nc. Assistant Superintendents\r\nd. District Clerk\r\ne. All administrative staff (excluding teachers)\r\n\r\nExclude mass emails and newsletters that are sent to the general public or large groups of recipients. Instead, focus on communications that reference the following organizations, communications directly between the school district and these organizations, or communications where information from these organizations is shared, either through messages or attachments:\r\na. \"American Academy of Pediatrics\"\r\nb. \"AAP\"\r\nc. \"Council on School Health\"\r\nd. \"COSH\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is concerning that the initial response to my FOIL request indicated that no responsive documents existed in your records. I would appreciate an explanation as to why this discrepancy occurred, although I understand this may not be covered under FOIL.\r\n\r\nI hope these revisions will significantly reduce the volume of documents to be reviewed and make the request more manageable.

I understand from your last response that the District is in possession of over 2,000 responsive records.\r\n\r\nGiven that all of the records in question are electronic, I would like to refer to the New York State Committee on Open Government Advisory Opinion FOIL-AO-17734, which discusses the fee provisions of the Freedom of Information Law in relation to requests for records. According to the advisory opinion, when records can be transmitted via email, there would be no \"actual cost\" of reproduction.\r\n\r\nSince the documents are already in electronic form and have been found with reasonably little effort, I would like to clarify my understanding that no associated fees should be applied in this case. This would be in line with the guidance provided by the Committee on Open Government, which states that it is in the public interest to provide access to computerized records at low cost. Moreover, the Court of Appeals has held that the fulfillment of a government obligation to provide public access to information is not a waste of public funds (Doolan v. BOCES, 48 NY 2d 341, 347 [1979]).\r\n\r\nIn light of the electronic nature of the records and the public interest in ensuring access to them without incurring costs, I respectfully request that the District provide the responsive records without any fees. I appreciate your cooperation in this matter and look forward to receiving the records in a timely manner.",

Thank you ever so kindly for your response regarding the fees associated with the fulfillment of my FOIL request. As a follow-up to my previous message, I would like to bring to your attention a pertinent advisory opinion issued by the New York Department of State's Committee on Open Government, FOI-AO-19103, dated January 28, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn this advisory opinion, the Committee addressed the application of the Freedom of Information Law to records requested from the Office of the Attorney General. The opinion delineates that an agency, such as the South Colonie Central School District, is not permitted to charge for time spent reviewing records to determine which portions, if any, may be withheld. Furthermore, electronically removing material from email records is akin to blacking out sentences on a page prior to copying for release. The Freedom of Information Law has consistently required the agency to perform this redaction at no cost to the applicant.\r\n\r\nGiven the aforementioned advisory opinion and considering that the esteemed District is endowed with the necessary technology to effectuate electronic redactions in documents, I kindly emphasize that no fee should be imposed for the copying of files or the redaction of information, per the regulations provided in 21 CRR-NY 1401.8.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the overall District budget for the 2022-2023 year is a remarkable sum of $113,458,885, with approximately $10,000,000 allocated for administrative purposes. With such a munificent budget, I trust that the District has the means to fulfill my FOIL request without imposing undue fees.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the District encounters any difficulty in obtaining the requisite technology or personnel to execute the redactions, I am delighted to provide, a list of free software that can be employed for this purpose:\r\n\r\nLibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org/)\r\nPDF-XChange Editor (https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor)\r\nPDFescape (https://www.pdfescape.com/)\r\n\r\nWith the utmost respect, I humbly reiterate my request that the District waive the fees associated with the fulfillment of my FOIL request, save for the reasonable photocopying fees permitted under 21 CRR-NY 1401.8(b)(3) for redacted records, in compliance with the regulations provided in 21 CRR-NY 1401.8 and the advisory opinion FOI-AO-19103. Please note that these fees would only apply to records justifying redaction for which electronic redaction is not possible. That being said, sufficient information has been presented in this email, along with the said means of the District, which should be adequate for waiving fees on this request. I do hope this request is not too forward, and I extend my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation in this matter. I eagerly anticipate receiving the responsive records in a timely manner.",

        "communication": "Dear Assistant Superintendent Robilotti,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response and for taking the time to consult with your legal counsel regarding my FOIL request.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand and respect the stance of the District, I wish to further engage on this issue in the spirit of transparency, and I believe further clarification is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe regulation 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8 that your counsel has pointed out permits charging a fee under certain circumstances. However, considering the language of the regulation and the nature of my request, I am unable to fully understand the breakdown of the costs proposed by the District.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, paragraph (c)(1) of this regulation permits an agency to charge a fee equivalent to the hourly salary of the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill to prepare a copy of the requested record, but only when more than two hours of the said employee's time are required to do so. Therefore, I respectfully request clarification on which tasks involved in the preparation of my FOIL request required more than two hours to fulfill.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, paragraph (d) relates to retrieving or extracting a record or data maintained in a computer storage system. If this was part of the process in responding to my request, I kindly request further clarification on how much of the proposed fee is associated with this procedure.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while it is acknowledged that the District has the discretion to impose a fee according to paragraph (g) of the said regulation, it is also stated in the same paragraph that an agency may waive a fee in whole or in part when making copies of records available. Considering the public interest of the information I am seeking and its importance for public transparency, I kindly reiterate my request for a waiver of these fees.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay the fee for the sake of transparency on this crucial topic; however, I believe it is important to uphold the principles of FOIL, and that any charges should align with the regulations set out in 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8. Therefore, I request a detailed breakdown of the fee, including a justification for each component.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I extend my sincere gratitude for your assistance in this matter, and I am eagerly looking forward to your response.",

        "communication": "Dear Christopher Robilotti,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the fees associated with my recent Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request to the South Colonie Central School District. I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the proposed fee, however, I believe there may be a misunderstanding regarding the application of the regulations outlined in 21 NYCRR Part 1401, specifically section 1401.8.\r\n\r\nAs per your breakdown, the fee includes:\r\n\r\n1. 1 hour @ $50.00 - For refining the original request to its current state.\r\n2. 2.5 hours @ $75.00 - For your review of all 636 pages before releasing them.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the regulations, I would like to draw your attention to the following:\r\n\r\n1. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(a)(2) states that an agency shall not charge a fee for the search for, administrative costs of, or employee time to prepare photocopies of records. This seems to contradict the first part of the fee you have proposed, which charges for the time spent refining the original request.\r\n\r\n2. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(a)(3) states that an agency shall not charge a fee for the review of the content of requested records to determine the extent to which records must be disclosed or may be withheld. This appears to contradict the second part of the fee you have proposed, which charges for your review of the pages before they are released.\r\n\r\n3. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(c)(i) allows an agency to charge a fee based on the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare a copy of the requested record, but only when more than two hours of the employee\u2019s time is necessary to do so. If the time spent refining the original request and reviewing the pages before they are released is considered as time spent preparing a copy of the requested record, it would seem that the total time spent is less than two hours, and thus, according to this regulation, should not be chargeable.\r\n\r\n4. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(g) allows an agency to waive a fee in whole or in part when making copies of records available. Given the public interest in the requested records and the potential for the fees to be a barrier to access, I would like to request that the South Colonie Central School District consider waiving the fees associated with this request.\r\n\r\nI understand the complexity of this issue and the importance of your role in this process. However, my objective is to ensure that the proposed fee aligns with the principles and regulations set out in 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8. I would appreciate further clarification on the interpretation of this regulation and a reconsideration of the fees associated with my request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this issue.

        "communication": "I am writing to appeal the denial of access to certain records related to my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request dated March 6, 2023. The request sought records related to communications with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Council on School Health. The denial of access to these records is inconsistent with the principles of FOIL and the public's right to access information about the operations of public institutions.\r\n\r\nThe South Colonie Central School District identified several documents that it deemed \"not disclosable\" under Section 87 2 of the Public Officers Law, which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency materials. However, the District did not provide any specific reasons or explanations as to why these documents fall under this exemption, nor did it explain why the public interest in disclosure does not outweigh the reasons for denial.\r\n\r\nAs per the guidance provided by the Committee on Open Government (COOG), FOIL is based upon a presumption of access. All records maintained by the school district are available, except to the extent that the records or any portion of a record can be withheld based on one of the permissible statutory grounds for denial. The COOG has also indicated that when an agency denies access to a record or any portion of a record, it is obligated to provide a reason for the denial in writing and to advise the applicant of their right to appeal that denial.\r\n\r\nBased on the advisory opinions shared by the COOG, it is clear that the District's assertion that the records are intra-agency or inter-agency material does not automatically exempt them from disclosure. For instance, in Advisory Opinion 8825, it was stated that \"inter-agency or intra-agency materials\" do not include statistical or factual tabulations or data, instructions to staff that affect the public, or final agency policy or determinations. Therefore, if any of the withheld documents fall into these categories, they should be disclosed.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you review the content of the records and either disclose them or fully explain the reason for further denial. I look forward to your prompt response within ten business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

I am writing in response to your letter dated April 17, 2023, regarding my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request filed on March 20, 2023, concerning the Government Alliance on Race and Equity.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt acknowledgment of my request and your efforts to locate the relevant documents. However, considering the extended deadline of June 21, 2023, I would like to kindly request a rolling release of any responsive records identified during the ongoing diligent search process.\r\n\r\nReceiving the information on a rolling basis would greatly benefit the public's interest in transparency and access to these crucial records. It would allow for a more timely dissemination of information while still maintaining your agency's due diligence in conducting a thorough search.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I kindly ask that you consider releasing the records as they are identified, reviewed, and redacted if necessary. By implementing a rolling release, we can ensure timely access to vital information and foster greater collaboration between our parties.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you can accommodate this request or if you need any further clarification or information. I am more than willing to work with you to make this process as efficient and smooth as possible. ",

The request, identified by the NYSDOH as FOIL #: 23-03-263, sought records related to the Government Alliance on Race and Equity (GARE).\r\n\r\nThe NYSDOH has repeatedly extended the estimated completion date for this request, most recently to August 24, 2023. While I understand that some requests may require more time to process due to their complexity or the volume of records involved, the continual extensions without evidence of a diligent search for the requested records raises concerns about the NYSDOH's compliance with FOIL.\r\n\r\nUnder FOIL, an agency is required to make a diligent effort to locate and provide the requested records. While I understand that the NYSDOH may not be able to provide a detailed account of its search process due to the ongoing nature of the search, some evidence of the steps taken to locate the requested records would be expected. This could include, for example, information about the databases or filing systems searched, the search terms used, or the staff members involved in the search.\r\n\r\nThe lack of such evidence in the NYSDOH's responses to date suggests that the Department may not be conducting a diligent search for the requested records. This is contrary to the spirit and letter of FOIL, which is intended to promote transparency and accountability in government.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that the NYSDOH be directed to provide evidence of its search efforts to date and to expedite the processing of this request to the extent possible. If the Department continues to encounter difficulties in locating the requested records, I would be willing to work with the Department to refine the request in a manner that would facilitate a more efficient search.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMeghan Leong",

The original deadline of April 11, 2023, was extended to April 27, 2023, then to May 19, 2023, and most recently to June 29, 2023. These continual extensions, without evidence of a diligent search for the requested records, amount to a constructive denial of my request.\r\n\r\nUnder FOIL, an agency has five business days to approve or deny a request and may extend the deadline by up to twenty additional business days if more time is needed to process the request. However, continual extensions without a valid reason may be considered a constructive denial of the request.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that my appeal be granted, and that the Latham Water District expedite the processing of my request. If the district continues to need more time to process the request, I ask that it provide a detailed explanation for the delay and evidence of a diligent search for the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use.

Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Please provide the following:\r\n\r\n-The number of approved products to date since the recreational market opened (June 2018 to present), broken down by category.\r\n\r\n-All images/photographs/files and information (as detailed in 935 CMR 500.104 (7)(b)(1)-(2)) pertaining to proposed packaging and/or labels that have been rejected by the CCC since the recreational market opened (June 2018 to present), including the specific reasons for the rejection.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The courts have been consistent that name, address, telephone number, and email addresses of public records requestors are NOT EXEMPT from disclosure. \r\n \r\n 1.\tYou have provided no exemption logs. Why are you redacting information? What exemptions are you claiming under the PRA?\r\n \r\n 2. You have transformed and modified these original records requested into new records with new filenames. You have created new records which was not requested. \r\n \r\n For instance, file \"LWSD-Muckrock_000163.pdf\" refers to a request including the following:\r\n \r\n \"Dear Mr. Boyd:\r\n \r\n Attached please find the records responsive for your May 11, 2015 request for:\r\n \r\n Access to and a copy of all data related to concussion incidents for high school athletes at all high schools in the district but at least Lake Washington High School for sports years 2004-2014. All data with columns related to date, sport, season, age, gender, days kept out, and any records associated with district recording related to the Lystedt Law CRCW.28A.600. 190.\"\r\n \r\n However no responsive records are attached. Another .pdf file in the installment does refer to concussion incident reports, however as a requestor I am not obligated to assume, guess, or infer that this file which was attached to a response to Mr. Bord's request, a file which you have extracted and renamed from the originally requested PRA response if it is in fact the original attachment. \r\n \r\n Additionally, missing  is Mr. Boyd's original public records request as well as others, however we are not given enough context to understand what is missing and what is not.\r\n\r\n3. What records does this \"installment 1\" represent? You provide no context, meanwhile Lake Washington School District has already provided multiple installments of records. This is certainly not \"Installment One.\" Please explain in detail. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records again as requested, unredacted or with the proper exemption logs and explanations of what records are being provided, what records are being withheld, and why. \r\n\r\n4. We understand that now the District is for the 4th time giving a new \"final\"  estimated completion date for this request as 02-28-2023 (modified from the original missed final estimated completion date of 07-15-2022 Originally Provided by the District on 11-21-21).\r\n\r\nThank you.",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

Secure confinement for periods of more than 24 hours must be reviewed every 24 hours by the superintendent or the superintendent's designee who was not involved in the incident necessitating that confinement. Secure confinement may be extended for additional periods if necessary for the safety of juveniles or others, or to ensure the safety of the facility. Secure confinement may not exceed five 24-hour periods. (b) A facility shall provide appropriate services and programs for high-risk juveniles who cannot control their assaultive behavior, who present a danger to themselves, or who are in constant danger of being victimized by other juveniles, thus requiring special management.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Cobb,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the 501(c)3 non-profit organization Reclaim The Records, I would like to request a\r\ncopy of the following files from the New York City Municipal Archives and its parent agency the New\r\nYork City Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS), under the New York State\r\nFreedom of Information Law (FOIL):\r\n\r\n1) Every single digital image you have, and any text metadata that goes with them.\r\n\r\nAs the Archives is undoubtedly aware, New York law states that \u201c...FOIL does not differentiate\r\nbetween records stored in paper form or those stored in electronic format...if the records are maintained\r\nelectronically by an agency and are retrievable with reasonable effort, that agency is required to\r\ndisclose the information.\u201d Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454, 464 (2007).\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are requesting a copy of every already-digitized image file of a historical\r\ndocument that DORIS has in its possession. This includes, but is not limited to, all the digital images\r\nthat are available online already, on the Archives' official \"Digital Collections\" website at\r\nhttp://nycma.lunaimaging.com/ which is run in conjunction with the company Luna Imaging, or on any\r\nother website maintained or controlled by the Archives or by DORIS.\r\n\r\nFor example, these records include, but are not limited to, all the digitized images of all the\r\ncollections the Archives has already placed online in recent years, such as the \u201cAlmshouse Collection,\r\n1758-1952\u201d, \u201cNew York County Jury Census, 1816-1821\u201d, \u201cBodies in Transit Registers, 1859-1894\u201d,\r\n\u201cLiquor licenses, Manhattan and Brooklyn, 1895-1986\u201d [sic \u2013 should be 1895-1896], the 1940's era\r\nNew York City \u201cTax Photos\u201d collection, the various \u201cBooks and Manuscripts\u201d files (including the\r\nbook of Colonial era deeds for Queens county, previously thought to be lost), the\u201cWPA Federal\r\nWriters' Project, NYC Unit Photograph Collection, 1935-1943\u201d and so on.\r\n\r\nThis request also includes all the digital images of historical records that the Archives or\r\nDORIS possesses which are already digitized but which are not yet available online, including those\r\nthat are stored on internal or external or Internet-connected hard drives, or files that would be\r\naccessible to patrons on internal networks onsite at the Archives building at 31 Chambers Street in\r\nManhattan, if there were not currently a pandemic closing public access to that reading room.\r\n\r\nFor example, these records include, but are not limited to, all of the historical New York City\r\nbirth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, and marriage licenses that have been recently\r\nscanned in full color and in high definition. We are aware that there may be some data gaps in this new\r\ncollection and that, in particular, not all of the records for all of the years for the New York City Clerk's\r\nOffice marriage license series have been scanned yet, but we will take what you have so far.\r\n\r\nThese records also include any historical materials that the Archives or DORIS may have\r\ndigitized internally or through a partner or vendor, where those images have not yet been published\r\nonline and/or are not available to the public onsite, but do exist on Archives or DORIS hard drives or\r\nonline storage.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting copies of all these digital images in their original formats and in their original\r\nsizes, in their full resolution, not edited, not resized, not compressed, and not watermarked \u2013 just as\r\nthey appear to the public right now on DORIS' website(s) or internal network(s) or internal hard\r\ndrive(s) or online hard drive(s). We would prefer that the images be delivered to us in TIF or TIFF\r\nformat, if possible, or in JPEG or JPG format if not. We also would like the files delivered to us in their\r\nexisting folder structure, clearly separating out each collection or sub-collection into unique folders\r\nwith recognizable folder names and file names.\r\n\r\nWe also request copies of all the metadata that goes along with these digitized images. For\r\nexample, the Archives has a database of the transcribed names and dates and places and file numbers\r\nfrom its newly scanned vital records collection. This makes it possible for Archives patrons sitting in\r\nthe Archives building at 31 Chambers Street to do a name or date or Borough search for a historical\r\nbirth, marriage, or death record, and then see each resulting digital image, or place an order for the\r\ncertified paper copy of the record, if they prefer. This database is made available on Archives\r\ncomputers through an internal DORIS network and is also available through DORIS' public WiFi, and\r\nit is freely accessible to the public to use while they are onsite, were that location not currently closed\r\ndue to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAs another example, nearly all of the photos and images that are already online on DORIS'\r\nLuna Imaging website have text metadata included, listing information about the subjects, the\r\nlocations, the years, the original formats and sizes (etc.) of each set of digital photos or scanned\r\nmaterials. Some of those individual photographs also have unique text captions. We request all of that\r\nmetadata, too.\r\n\r\nWe would prefer that all these metadata sets or databases be sent to us in their original digital\r\ntext formats, such as SQL database export(s), CSV file(s), Microsoft Excel spreadsheet(s), etc. We\r\nwould prefer to receive the data as SQL exports, if possible. We request this data in their full and\r\nunredacted forms, including all column headers and all data dictionaries and data schemas for any\r\ndatabases, if they exist.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this FOIL request, we are not requesting copies of any of the Archives'\r\ndigitized moving picture files or digitized audio files or collections that are primarily made of video or\r\naudio files, such as the \u201cNYPD Surveillance Films\u201d collection or the \u201cWNYC: Radio, Film, and TV\u201d\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nAnd for the purposes of this FOIL request, we are also not requesting any of the recent\r\n\u201cmayoral\u201d collections, which are generally subject files and correspondence from various New York\r\nCity mayors' administrations, even though many of those are already digitized.\r\n\r\nAnd for the purposes of this FOIL request, we are also not requesting any physical microfilms.\r\n(We will be making several FOIL requests for many new microfilm-to-microfilm copies, just as we\r\nhave been doing for the past six years, but those requests will be handled separately from this request.)\r\n\r\nPlease inform us of the costs of fulfilling this request before doing so. We will expect the digital\r\nimage files and their metadata and their folder structures to be delivered to us either on physical hard\r\ndrives, for which we will pay the hardware costs and the insured and trackable domestic shipping costs,\r\nor through an online file transfer platform such as Dropbox or Box or Google Drive.\r\n\r\nShould this request not be met with prompt production of these records, please consider the\r\nrequest ongoing in nature. When production is made, please include all relevant documents which have\r\nbeen converted into an electronic format between the date of this request and the actual time of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nAs your agency knows, we are a non-profit organization, and we will be using these documents\r\nfor non-commercial purposes. We look forward to freely publishing these millions of public records\r\nonline, without any kind of paywall or restrictions as to their use and reuse. Public records belong to\r\nthe public, and we want our records back.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your reply in the next five business days, as required by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nvery cheerfully yours,\r\n\r\nBrooke Schreier Ganz, on behalf of Reclaim The Records\r\nPresident and Founder, Reclaim The Records\r\nhttps://www.ReclaimTheRecords.org/",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

Upon reviewing many of the records you quested appear to be prohibited from being released. However, I would like to help you obtain as many records as I am legally able to release. I am very interested in your query of juvenile records from the schools concerning arrests and incidents. I hope your going to publish this information so we can better understand the significance of juvenile related arrests in schools. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I would be able to export the existing CAD juvenile incidents related to juveniles at schools. Please understand that our department policy discourages any arrests made within the schools, unless immediate life safety is directly involved. I feel the school administration, and/or the child\u2019s parents can better serve as the disciplinary than the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough, I will not be able to release the juvenile incident reports, I would be able to release the CAD information for those calls for service. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like the CAD information. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKyle P.
