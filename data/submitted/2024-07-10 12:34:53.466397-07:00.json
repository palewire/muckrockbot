I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

All requests are processed in the order in which they are received, and no requests are prioritized by deadline date. The amount of time to completely process your request depends upon the number of pending requests, volume of material encompassed in the request, and the amount of redaction, if any, that is necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware, if you are requesting records with large amount of body camera videos and or high-profile cases, the time to complete your request may be significantly longer as these cases are often voluminous. Identifying the specific record(s) being requested may help expedite your request. You will be notified once records are made available for you to download or pick up, or if no records are found. Your tracking # is 2013. When checking the status of your request, please send emails to mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov<mailto:mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov> and include your tracking # 2013.\r\n\r\n***Effective February 1, 2024, pursuant to ARS 39-129, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) Legal Liaison Section has implemented a new fee schedule for requests for video recordings.  The fee for processing video recordings is $25 per each video-hour ($6.25 per quarter hour).  In the event there are contemporaneous multiple requests for the same video, the cost associated with processing the video will be shared equally between all requesting parties at that time. Requests for previously processed videos will be at no cost unless the requestor wishes to receive a hard copy instead of an electronic copy. Fees for hardcopies are listed below. ***\r\n\r\nThe fee breakdown for hard copies are as follows:\r\n\r\nDocuments:                       $.50 for each page\r\n\r\nCD\u2019s:                                      $15.00 each\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAD2B3.2C4158F0]\r\n\r\nSgt.

In\r\nshort, though: your request, as is, may qualify for a 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut it does not qualify for a fee waiver. To qualify for a fee waiver, the\r\nrequest, among other things, must be narrowly tailored to preserve public\r\nresources, which it is not as it seeks records from a two year period from\r\nroughly 90 offices. Speaking more frankly, I can also tell you that a\r\nsearch in our e-mail records collection tool of \u201cfair work week\u201d\r\nunfortunately won\u2019t only return hits with \u201cfair work week\u201d -- it will\r\nreturn anything with \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d or \u201cweek\u201d in it, which I\u2019m sure you\r\ncan imagine will create countless (likely many thousands of) records that\r\nare not responsive to your request and that will need to be sorted through\r\nbefore we can provide you with the records that are responsive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to read through the attached policy and can confirm that\r\nyour request meets all of the qualifications for a fee reduction, I can\r\nproceed with the request as is and will grant you the 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut would ask for your patience as this request will take months of work to\r\ncomplete. I am also happy to work with you to help you reconfigure your\r\nrequest to be more specific (for example, by narrowing the search window,\r\nor seeking records from fewer offices) so that we can grant that full fee\r\nwaiver. If we do proceed with a fee reduction only, I will make sure to\r\ncommunicate a fee estimate before we actually begin processing your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed once you\u2019ve had a chance\r\nto read through the attached policy document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Michael Burns *|* Legal and Public Records Assistant*\r\n\r\nOffice of the Legislative Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice: 503.986.1243\r\n\r\n[image: http://intranet/CapitolImages/Oregon%20State%20Seal%20-%20Color.jpg]\n",

I understand the need to weigh the public interest in the records\r\nrequested against the burden of retrieving and reviewing them. I would be\r\nhappy to narrow my request by limiting the number of email accounts and\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\nBefore I revise my request, I wonder if you could clarify how these records\r\n(legislative email messages and attachments) are stored and searched for\r\nthe purposes of public records requests. I am surprised to learn that your\r\ncollection tool does not allow for compound search terms or operators (e.g.\r\nfair AND work AND week). One way of working around this limitation might be\r\nto narrow the keyword search to certain fields, e.g. the email subject or\r\nattachment file name. Another possibility would be to search for records\r\ncontaining relevant bill numbers (SB878, SB888) instead of common words.\r\nBut I'm not sure if you can search specific fields or metadata of these\r\nemails. I would appreciate any further information or assistance you could\r\nprovide in tailoring my request.\r\n\nAll the best,\r\nPeter",

        "communication": "Hi Peter,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad you asked, because it gave me an opportunity to check in with the team that pulls e-mails for us (our IT folks are the ones who pull the records, while we review, redact, and discuss/disseminate them with/to the various concerned parties.) What they told me is that compound search terms with operators do (read: should) work, and that if I am seeing results that contradict that we can investigate why. Since I frequently see evidence to the contrary, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to review with them the next time the issue comes up. It\u2019s quite possible that user error (i.e. using operators in lower case instead of all caps) yielded nonresponsive records in the past. Thankfully we do always find the correct records (assuming they exist)... we just tend to end up with a lot of separating the wheat from the chaff, which isn\u2019t practical for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe tool they use, by the way, is Office 365 eDiscovery. It doesn\u2019t allow you to limit what fields you\u2019re searching in, but if you\u2019re curious, this<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-keyword-queries-and-search-conditions?view=o365-worldwide> article discusses the ins-and-outs of how to use it.\r\n\r\nAs for your current request: really, I can limit it however you\u2019d like. The goal here is to make sure you are getting the records you want and are entitled to, so I\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re doing it right. I\u2019ll just need you to specify the conditions so I\u2019m not misinterpreting anything. We can use your original search terms, and can also add SB###, SB ###, Senate Bill ###, etc. to the list of terms. The search will find hits in both e-mails and attachments. The biggest issue remains the number of accounts you\u2019re asking us to pull records from, and the best advice I can offer is to limit your search to members of the Legislative Assembly and committees that actually worked on whichever bills you\u2019re interested in. You\u2019ll need to do the research on that if that\u2019s a route you\u2019d like to take, but OLIS<https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/previous-session-bills.aspx> is a great place to start.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll await further correspondence. Have a great day in the meantime.\r\n\r\nMichael\n",
