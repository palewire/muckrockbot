Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tNARA\u2019s alleged past massive false FOIA reporting is great public interest.\r\nb.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\nc.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public- comments\r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020\tAccess and disclosure request files.

Any person subject to this chapter who, with intent to deceive\u2014\r\n(1)\tsigns any false record, return, regulation, order, or other official document, knowing it to be false; or\r\n(2)\tmakes any other false official statement knowing it to be false; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d\r\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK OF FOIA\r\n\r\n1.\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n2.\tFOIA requires that \u201ceach agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A).\r\n3.\tFOIA requires that \u201ceach agency shall establish a system to assign an individualized tracking number for each request received that will take longer than ten days to process and provide to each person making a request the tracking number assigned to the request\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(A).\r\n4.\tFOIA requires that each agency shall \u201cestablish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making the request using the assigned tracking number, including the date on which the agency originally received the request; and an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request. 5\r\nU.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(B).\r\n5.\tFOIA also requires federal agencies to make a final determination on FOIA administrative appeals that it receives within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, unless the agency expressly provides notice to the requester of \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d meriting additional time for responding to a FOIA request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).\r\n6.\tFOIA expressly provides that a person shall be deemed to have constructively exhausted their administrative remedies if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limitations provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(I) - (ii). See also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).\r\n7.\tFOIA  provides that any person who has not been provided the records requested pursuant to FOIA, after exhausting their administrative remedies, may seek legal redress from the Federal District Court to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\r\n8.\tRegarding the names of the FOIA requesters, the courts have held that under the FOIA requesters do not have an expectation of privacy. Stauss v. IRS, 516 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (D.D.C. 1981),\r\n9.\tUnder FOIA, the federal agency has the burden of sustaining its actions. 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n10.\tPursuant to FOIA, a Court may assess attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the Plaintiff prevails in an action thereunder. 5\r\nU.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).\r\n11.\tDepartment of Justice (DOJ) has issued a handbook addressing FOIA Annual Reports. See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_jus tice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d).\r\n12.\tAmong other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d\r\n13.\tThe DOJ Handbook also states:\r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report. It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n\r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking. If you believe that my request is unclear, if you have any questions, or if there is anything else that you need from me to complete this request in a timely manner, please contact me in writing, so that I may perfect my request. If you deem that any portion of my request is unclear, answer the remaining portions and I will perfect a request for additional material as needed.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance.

NARA Open FOIA Requests and Appeals FY 2023\r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply.\r\n\r\nRECORDS SOUGHT VIA FOIA.\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 24-A.D.MUCK. NARA Open FOIA Requests and Appeals FY 2023. See PDF.\r\n\r\n1.\tFOIA logs or logs by any other name containing records of all FOIA requests and appeals that were received or remained open from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 (FY 2023).\r\na.\tI am seeking logs in MS Excel format if available.\r\nb.\tThe data may be contained in one contiguous log or a combination of logs for prior fiscal years. Nevertheless, I am seeking all data.\r\n2.\tData that I am seeking for each FOIA request or appeal, which is in the Agency\u2019s custody, includes:\r\na. Tracking number of the request (unique individualized FOIA tracking number).\r\nb. Date of the request. \r\nc. Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \r\nd. Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request. \r\ne. Subject matter of the request. f. Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.). \r\ng. Date the request was perfected. \r\nh. The result of each FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni. Exemptions cited, if any. \r\nj. Date on which the request was resolved. \r\nk. Fee category assigned to requester (commercial, educational, news media, other). \r\nl. Whether a fee waiver was requested. \r\nm. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted. \r\nn. Fees charged to the requester, if any. \r\no. Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well. \r\np. Whether expedited processing was requested.\r\nq. Whether expedited processing was granted.\r\n\r\n3.\tNote that past \u201cFOIA Logs\u201d posted to NARA\u2019s website do not contain all this data. NARA has other records responsive to my FOIA request. \r\n\r\n4.\tNote that past \u201cFOIA Logs\u201d posted to NARA\u2019s website only identify FOIA requests and appeals received during the current fiscal year and do not account for prior year requests and appeals that may have been completed during a subsequent fiscal year or remain open.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\n\r\n6.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n\r\n7.\tThe Agency copy of this FOIA Request this FOIA request itself is an agency record, \u201creceived by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied). \r\n\r\n\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d  44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nThe Webex recording link should also be included in the FOIA Advisory Committee meeting minutes. Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tNARA\u2019s alleged past massive false FOIA reporting is great public interest.\r\nb.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\nc.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting.

This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020\tAccess and disclosure request files.
