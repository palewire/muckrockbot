I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

The courts have been consistent that name, address, telephone number, and email addresses of public records requestors are NOT EXEMPT from disclosure. \r\n \r\n 1.\tYou have provided no exemption logs. Why are you redacting information? What exemptions are you claiming under the PRA?\r\n \r\n 2. You have transformed and modified these original records requested into new records with new filenames. You have created new records which was not requested. \r\n \r\n For instance, file \"LWSD-Muckrock_000163.pdf\" refers to a request including the following:\r\n \r\n \"Dear Mr. Boyd:\r\n \r\n Attached please find the records responsive for your May 11, 2015 request for:\r\n \r\n Access to and a copy of all data related to concussion incidents for high school athletes at all high schools in the district but at least Lake Washington High School for sports years 2004-2014. All data with columns related to date, sport, season, age, gender, days kept out, and any records associated with district recording related to the Lystedt Law CRCW.28A.600. 190.\"\r\n \r\n However no responsive records are attached. Another .pdf file in the installment does refer to concussion incident reports, however as a requestor I am not obligated to assume, guess, or infer that this file which was attached to a response to Mr. Bord's request, a file which you have extracted and renamed from the originally requested PRA response if it is in fact the original attachment. \r\n \r\n Additionally, missing  is Mr. Boyd's original public records request as well as others, however we are not given enough context to understand what is missing and what is not.\r\n\r\n3. What records does this \"installment 1\" represent? You provide no context, meanwhile Lake Washington School District has already provided multiple installments of records. This is certainly not \"Installment One.\" Please explain in detail. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records again as requested, unredacted or with the proper exemption logs and explanations of what records are being provided, what records are being withheld, and why. \r\n\r\n4. We understand that now the District is for the 4th time giving a new \"final\"  estimated completion date for this request as 02-28-2023 (modified from the original missed final estimated completion date of 07-15-2022 Originally Provided by the District on 11-21-21).\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The midpoints of the blockfaces are stored separately in the shapefile. The blockface ID in the data file is blockface_title.

A street or sidewalk score of 5 represents a visited blockface segment that could not be rated (often due to obstruction or other challenges).\"\r\n\r\nThe Muckrock form email asked to upload files to their website, however, I do not see a way to do so.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing John Lewis, whose death has been widely\r\n    reported in outlets such as the New York Times. See John Lewis, Towering\r\n    Figure of Civil Rights Era, Dies at 80\r\n    https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "OLYMPIA SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 School Resource Officer Program / School Safety and Security Staff Program / School District Law Enforcement Contracts and Agreements for the Years 2019-2022.\r\n\r\nVia email: dcrawford@osd.wednet.edu\r\n\r\nTo whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON STATE OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION - EQUITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS (https://www.k12.wa.us/policy-funding/equity-and-civil-rights):\r\n\r\n\"The Washington State legislature notes that schools should be a place in which all youth feel safe. With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Certain redactions have been made or records withheld pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a) and the corresponding 105 ILCS 5/34-18.5(b) which prohibits the release of background check information. Furthermore, Illinois state law prohibits the release of portions of public employee personnel files, such as teacher\u00a0performance\u00a0evaluations. Per 105 ILCS 5/24A-7.1, \u201cDisclosure of public school teacher, principal, and superintendent performance evaluations is prohibited,\u201d and 820 ILCS 40/11, \u201cDisclosure of performance evaluations under the Freedom of Information Act shall be prohibited,\u201d and related information has been removed. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, redactions have been applied pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

Redact your responses correctly because once you send them to us, there is no going back. **\r\n\r\nThis is an Oct. 4, 2019 Immediate Disclosure request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance (Ordinance) and the California Public Records Act (CPRA) for the following items from SFPD.  This is an also a SF Admin Code 67.21(c) request for 6 statements (one for each numbered request below) for the quantity (including even records you claim are exempt), form, and nature of records responsive to each request below -- which must be provided in 7 days with no extensions are permitted.\r\n\r\nI have a right to receive records by email (67.21(b)) and moreover I cannot be required to use your web portal which imposes Terms of Service conditions beyond the CPRA's requirements.  Please email (attachments) all responsive records.\r\n\r\nWe remind you of your obligation to provide electronic records in the format we request them if that format is easily generated (SFAC 67.21(l)).  Therefore, e-mails exported in the .eml or .msg format with all non-exempt headers, metadata, attachments, etc. are our choice. Other Documents may be provided in text (not scanned) PDF format.\r\nHowever, if you choose to convert emails, for example, to PDF or printed format, to easily redact them, you must ensure that you have preserved the full content of the original email record (as specified in request \"A\"), which contains many detailed headers beyond the generally used From/To/Subject/Sent/etc.  For chat apps, a screenshot or print-out is acceptable.\r\n\r\nIf you use PDF, you must use properly redacted searchable or text pdfs.  Don't use image PDFs to make it harder to analyze the records.  Do not print out records and then re-scan them to PDF - simply redact them in Adobe Acrobat if needed for example.  If you provide PDFs instead of original email files, only give a few of the headers or lacking attachments/images, and/or improperly withhold public records that exist on private accounts/devices you may be in violation of SF Admin Code and/or CPRA, and we may challenge your decision at the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force, Supervisor of Records, judicially, and/or via any other remedies available to us. \r\n\r\nYou must justify all withholding.  All justifications must be made with particularity (every redaction must be specifically referenced to a justification).\r\n\r\nProvide records in a rolling fashion.  Do not wait for all records to be available.\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required free notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.  Please use email to respond.\r\n\r\nEvery violation of the Sunshine Ordinance will be appealed --- please follow the Ordinance exactly as I am auditing your agency's public records regimen.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\n1. all records created, sent, or received from Jan. 1, 2019 to present, within the scope of Cal. Penal Code \u00a7832.7(b)(1)(A)(i)-(ii) on govt. property.

At the time I alleged that SFPD was simply refusing to provide us any records; that is no longer the case, and we have received on Nov. 25 the beginning of a rolling records response.  We now allege instead that public records or parts of records are being improperly withheld.\r\n\r\nYou may consider the Nov. 20 petition from this email address withdrawn, and consider this a new SFAC 67.21(d) petition for a written determination that all or some of the following parts of records are public and for all associated orders to disclose.  We will continue to pursue before the SOTF, instead of before you, an SFAC 67.25 violation for SFPD\u2019s refusal to (prior to our complaint) provide rolling responses.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached new petition.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\r\n",

By way of example, but not limitation, SFPD has redacted such information in the records documenting prior records request PRA 6443.\r\n\r\nSecond, it does not appear you have actually considered the SB 1421 redactions to determine whether or not they were lawful, or in other words, you have failed to determine whether or not the parts of the records I petitioned for were in fact public or not.  It is impossible for you to verify even a single redaction, because SFPD does not indicate which redaction is justified by which exemption.  This of course is the reason why the Sunshine Ordinance requires footnotes or other clear references for all redactions (SFAC 67.26), yet the City Attorney's office appears not to care about upholding this portion of the law.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is a further 67.21(d) petition to determine that all or some of the currently withheld (redacted) portions of the following record are public and order their disclosure: \r\n\r\n13-002_-_130188386_-_production_1.pdf at https://u8387795.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=Ow1KccipsoIsnXbuEgm-2FN-2B3KuyZ5YHnuXVUop6SBUj6Zl2gPWQsh2hjE0JdlwH66QdMJzrpYUZ4H0oDUn9cqKrPktPrLi0CPeV6JhPmxHQrvEiRqHQz6uedWfSFdwV57Bc0zxXqe-2BBoVO4d4AU5mrVb8oCfCzYfcs0v3Od2AFU6W8JedEBkwL4q9ccfaspmX6VHNCGfVy6P0ywJqzlhh7E-2Fn8RH7g9I2MZJ4YJ0ehG4-3D_IYcLe-2FsBaxpVrnweThVZTLrJlHg6avRfAZPcxChOOXzzFxE-2FbbftNjHqoyaXKS2OEdtvy-2FPH-2B1lGWzLGfc-2FQgcf1gYFK3V-2BFINBoHy9XDzKHZIbFDl1DTRQzpZvE4sSfXqnc4o-2F0dAyXrI2xNvncXqfb6y2NfTVkZhxN8NQ5s8VSrGozKjFMf-2B8Pb-2BrWphkR4c3JRtrdM7i7sgTsswFGooI0vEhgP-2BFb8kP-2BphTvaY5u-2BSnSD54uMhvQ5yPdOVJTclgZ9WgJjsgOfRj0R86sxVeoVU0irug6BwIKTkTysjj-2B0aOMl2ox-2B8kQmZdF2ZXXXdIh7rrensztRIX9qdTuz2rX9jA55Z40ql7y5NhfblYhOgxii0zJAbtBtLegTHfSZP9gSWs1Y53k97ckao8FFA-3D-3D\r\n\r\nI will pursure the remainder of the violations before the SOTF in the pending complaint.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnonymous",

No part of the law or that order precludes the SOTF from proceeding without City responses or presence at hearings - it just says they dn't have to reply and attend.  \r\n\r\nIf Herrera thinks it is in his interest to not respond or (as in a few days ago) to not attend, that's up to him.  SOTF should continue to administer justice and secure the right of the people to public information and meetings without Herrera's input.   It is the SOTF Committee's choice, not Herrera's nor Breed's, to decide whether to continue a hearing or proceed with it when the case comes up in due course.\r\n\r\nAnything else would allow those very City officials the SOTF polices an absolute power to indefinitely delay public access by controlling the SOTF's agenda.  I urge you to reject such nonsense.\r\n\r\nIf the Mayor wishes to specifically obstruct the SOTF from doing its duty, she's going to need to show clearly her full intentions to crush sunshine and issue some explicit orders to make that happen.  Fortunately the Board of Supervisors didn't allow that last time.  But perhaps Herrera will go convince the Mayor to issue such specific orders.  If she does, then that can be challenged in court as having no relationship to the current public health exigencies whatsoever, and outside of the Mayor's emergency powers.\r\n\r\n--Anonymous\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the West Virginia Freedom of Information Act, seeking records related to law enforcement officer certification in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including ABC News, KQED, MuckRock, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking two categories of certification records:   \r\n\r\n* All certified officers \r\nAll law enforcement officers who are actively certified as of the date of this request (or when the request is processed). If your system maintains historical records of previously certified officers who are no longer active, please include them as far back as possible. If correctional officers are certified by your agency, please include them as well.  \r\n\r\n* Decertified officers\r\nAll law enforcement officers who have been decertified through revocations, voluntary surrenders, suspensions or any other actions going back as far as possible. Please include records for decertified correctional officers if available. \r\n\r\nData elements for certified officers:\r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST or state certification ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency start date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s previous departments/agencies (employment history), with start and end dates\r\n* Officer\u2019s positions and/or ranks at previous departments or agencies\r\n* Officer\u2019s original date of certification\r\n* Current status of certification (active, lapsed, expired, suspended, etc.)\r\n* Last action taken on certification\r\n* Date of last action on certification \r\n* Disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Dates of disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Training history/additional certifications of this officer, if available\r\n\r\nData elements for decertified officers: \r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence.\r\n* Officer\u2019s last department/agency, with start and end date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Decertification action taken (revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, etc.)\r\n* Date decertification action taken\r\n* POST case number, if applicable\r\n* Reason for decertification or similar action\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSarah Siock\r\nReporter\r\nHoward Center for Investigative Journalism",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It includes salary information for all executive branch employees paid through OSUP as well as employees of public universities who are paid through other systems. OSUP does not process payroll for public universities, and therefore, any reporting prepared by OSUP does not include those employees. In short, the attached document is more comprehensive than what OSUP and the Division of Administration can provide.\r\n\r\nBecause this document was prepared by the Department of State Civil Service, any questions regarding its contents should be directed to them.\r\n\r\nIf this document satisfies your request, please respond accordingly so that OSUP can remove your report out of its queue in order to facilitate their other reporting requirements. Otherwise, OSUP\u2019s report will be provided to you when it is available.

In response to your public records request, the Office of State Uniform Payroll has produced several spreadsheets, which can be accessed using the following DropBox link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/jhn4dw20nhs8he5/AAC7fSDwEij-wSXtdvcsTNo5a?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe information provided is for employees of executive branch agencies paid through the LaGov HCM payroll system.  This does not include higher education or agencies in the legislative and judicial branches of government.\r\n\r\nThe worksheets are sorted by Agency Number. The Agency Name Reference workbook contains a mapping of personnel area (PA) number (agency) to personnel area text (agency name). The first three (3) characters in the name represent the department.\r\n\r\nThere may be employees on the Demographic worksheets and not on the Race_Gender_Work Parish worksheets. This is because the position does not have a work parish specified and thus they are excluded from the report used to gather this information.\r\n\r\nWith this production, the Division of Administration considers your public records request satisfied and will close its file.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Requests\r\nDivision of Administration\r\nState of Louisiana\r\nEmail: doapublicrecords@la.gov<mailto:doapublicrecords@la.gov>\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Owens:\r\n\r\nThis email is in response to your request for public records dated March 7, 2023, to the City Clerk of the City of Elizabeth pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq. (OPRA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou sought the following records:\r\n\r\n  1.  Incident-level data on Elizabeth (NJ) Police Department [EPD] officers\u2019 drawing their weapons/firearms in the course of their duty [\u2026] from years 2000 to 2020, including the time, date, and street address (e.g. 123 Main St) for all incidents where an officer drew their weapon/firearm;\r\n  2.  Incident-level data on [EPD] officers\u2019 discharging their weapons/firearms in the course of their duty [\u2026] from years 2000 to 2020, including the time, date, and street address (e.g. 123 Main St) for all incidents where an officer discharged their firearm;\r\n  3.  If incident-level data on the [EPD] officers\u2019 discharging their firearms in the course of their duty from years 2000 to 2020 inclusive is available, [you requested] associated data on whether the shootings by the officers were lethal (i.e. suspects or civilians died as a result of gunshots\u2019 from officers\u2019 weapons) or non-lethal (i.e. suspects or civilians were shot but did not die); and\r\n  4.  Demographic data on the officers and suspects or civilians involved in each incident of [EPD] officers drawing, discharging, and/or striking (lethal and non-lethal) of suspects or civilians.\r\n\r\nRegarding all four of your data requests, please be advised that no responsive records exist from 2000-2006. From 2007 until May 2015, all use of force reports with the requested information are stored in scanned PDF form. There is no way to collate the data besides recording it one-by-one, which requires the custodian to conduct research and create a new record, which she is not required to do under OPRA. From May 2015 to September 2020, the use of force reports have been archived as the EPD no longer uses the system the reports were originally stored in. At this time, we are still determining if the data for these records can be collated into easily generated data. Please allow the City\u2019s custodian additional time of seven (7) business days to investigate further.\r\n\r\nFor the year 2020, all of the data requested for 2020 to present is readily available on the New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s website (https://www.njoag.gov/force/). Once you follow the link, you must scroll down and click \u201cAccess Use of Force Dashboard\u201d. From there, you are able to search for the EPD and the requested types of force and demographics and find the records you are searching for. EPD inputs this information directly to the State, so records for 2020 will be identical to those found on the State dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience, I will reach back out with the status of the 2007-May 2015 data shortly.\r\n\r\n\nAll the best,\r\n\r\n\r\nSamantha J. Castrelos, Esq.\r\nSpecial Counsel\r\nCity of Elizabeth, Law Department\r\n50 Winfield Scott Plaza, Room 201\r\nElizabeth, New Jersey 07201\r\n(908) 820-4009",

It's very helpful.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of force reports from 2007 though mid-2015 that are are only available via PDF, may I request copies of the PDFs of the reports? That would meet my initial request that whatever I receive be \"filled electronically, by e-mail attachment.\" It also would mean that there'd be no need for the custodian to do any research, and there'd be no need for a new record to be created create collation. The same would be true if I the reports from mid-May 2015 through 2019 were PDFs, too.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you.",

I actually misspoke in my last email when I said they were stored as scanned PDFs. They are actually stored as hard copies but we can scan and send over. However we still need to review each report as sometimes the civilians are minors so their identities will need to be redacted. Is there a time frame in which you need to receive all records by? We can begin this process but it does take some time for review and we can send over on a rolling basis if there is no rush. Please advise.\nThank you,\r\nSamantha",
