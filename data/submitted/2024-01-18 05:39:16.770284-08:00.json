December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA + FOIA Budgets\r\n\r\n6.\tThe Agency copy of this FOIA Request. This FOIA request itself is an agency record, \u201creceived by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied). \r\n\r\n\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d  44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nThe Webex recording link should also be included in the FOIA Advisory Committee meeting minutes. Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed.

My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting.

Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA + FOIA Budgets\r\n\r\n[View as HTML]\r\n\r\nGreetings Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA Professionals, media, interested parties (1,200+).\r\n\r\nI felt compelled to provide detailed and forceful responses to NARA\u2019s mindless assertions in NARA\u2019s December 6, 2023 1:01 PM email below denying my simple request for ADA accommodation without any justification whatsoever, and to share this with you. Like me, you may have current and/or former co-workers, friends, and family that need this accommodation at any given time of having the YouTube chat function enabled, which NARA used to provide as a matter of routine without asking. This allows anyone to make contemporaneous comments to the meeting content and have them preserved for future viewers. To date there have been 1,800 views of the December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting YouTube video, meaning that 1,800 viewers (perhaps including you) have been deprived of my substantive contemporaneous comments and that I have been deprived of the opportunity to communicate them. \r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s actions are unjustified and indefensible - irreversible harm.  \r\n\r\nOne may conclude that the Archivist of the United States and NARA generally disfavor public participation highlighting needed increased funding and FOIA process improvements.\r\n\r\nThe attachments to this email deserve wide-spread distribution and preservation.\r\n\r\n--/\r\nThe FOIA Advisory Committee is essential to the functioning of our democracy. Since 1967, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. One of my Webex chat comments of interest to you, which I would have posted to the YouTube chat, involves agency top-line budgets for FOIA:\r\n\r\nAgency Top-line Budgets for FOIA. Also, every agency budget should have a top-line budget item for records management and FOIA, justified by how dismal performance and employee professional development retention are without the funding. This would be a game changer for beleaguered, overwhelmed FOIA staffs and a gift to our nation. FOIA Advisory Committee member David Cuillier, University of Arizona, and co-author Charles N. Davis, University of Missouri-Colombia of The Art of Access. Strategies for Acquiring Public Records wrote something like. \u201cI never hear of anyone being rewarded for releasing records under FOIA.\u201d  In my many years of federal service working side-by side with FOIA staff, I observed that despite their desires to serve the public interest, leadership thwarted release of embarrassing or threatening records.\r\n\r\n--/\r\nI am also including in this email my DOJ OIP compliance inquires related to my December 7, 2023 Expedited FOIA requests seeking the WEBEX video (NARA NGC24-082) and WEBEX chat comments (NARA NGC24-083) to the December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting, which are germane to my request for ADA accommodation for that FOIA Advisory Committee meeting.\r\n\r\nPlease see also my attached oral public comments to the recent September 29, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting addressing NARA\u2019s conduct of open FOIA meetings, including issues regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act and NARA\u2019s suppression of public participation in apparent violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. \r\n\r\nNothing has improved. Things have gotten worse. Please see my December 6, 2023 3:39 PM email below and attachments.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\n\u201cAn informed citizenry is at the heart of a dynamic democracy.\u201d - Thomas Jefferson        \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: foiacompliance@gmail.com <foiacompliance@gmail.com> \r\nSent: Wednesday, December 6, 2023 3:39 PM\r\nTo: 'FOIA Advisory Comm.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA\r\n\r\n[Best viewed as HTML]\r\nMs. Colleen Shogan, Archivist of the United States:\r\nMy guess is that you received correspondence from others regarding this matter. More may be coming.\r\nThe FOIA Advisory Committee reports to you, and you are responsible for ADA compliance and accommodation within NARA.\r\nNARA\u2019s inadequate December 6, 2023 1:01 PM email response below to my ADA request for simple accommodation:\r\n\u2022\tis materially inaccurate,\r\n\u2022\tdoes not provide accommodation to either hearing or speech impaired persons or the public in general, and \r\n\u2022\tdoes not provide any justification whatsoever for not accommodating my simple ADA request of turning on the YouTube chat comments to allow contemporaneous participation. OGIS goes out of its way to impede public participation in open FOIA meetings and worse. \r\nTherefore, this requires detailed and forceful responses to NARA\u2019s mindless assertions in NARA\u2019s December 6, 2023 1:01 PM email below.\r\nHAMMOND RESPONSES TO NARA\u2019S DECEMBER 6, 2023 DENIAL OF ADA ACCOMMODATION.\r\n1.\tWEBEX Chat. \r\na.\tNARA does not read all WEBEX chat comments aloud, including very substantive ones. Ms. Semo advises everyone at the start of the meeting not to submit substantive comments in the WEBEX chat and states (unlawfully in my view) they are not included in meeting minutes. Then OGIS (unlawfully in my view) destroys the WEBEX comments immediately (per NARA response to my FOIA request). Else, NARA is lying in its FOIA responses, which is of great interest to the FOIA Advisory Committee, the FOIA community and the public. See example Unauthorized Disposition (UD) complaint attached.\r\nb.\tDestruction of Records. NARA also destroys Chief FOIA Officer Council Records (and others) and does not publish or properly investigate UD complaints against NARA. (See Unauthorized Disposition of Federal Records _ National Archives - NARA TAB\u201d). Else, NARA is lying in its FOIA responses. See example relevant UD complaint attached. Not only are these violations of the underlying NARA UD policy (36 CFR Part 1230), but they are also violations of the Administrative Procedures Act in my view as a private citizen.\r\n\r\n2.\tOral Public Comments. \u201cif able, ask for an opportunity to provide an oral public comment.\u201d Not only does NARA routinely fail to call on me until I make a fuss, but how does \u201cif able\u201d accommodate my ADA accommodation request?\r\n\r\n3.\tWritten Public Comment. \r\na.\tNARA routinely (again in violation of multiple laws regulations and policies in my view) refuses to post my public comments. Compare the attached \u201cHammond Public Comments as of November 30 2023\u201d to the public comments posted to the FOIA Advisory Committee, Chief FOIA Officers Council and the OGIS Annual Open FOIA meeting. See also \u201cOGIS Posting Policy for Public Comments.\u201d\r\nb.\tNARA\u2019s new restrictive requirements limiting comments to 25,000 unformatted text-only characters massively diminishes what can be included. For example, my tables documenting massive NARA false FOIA reporting cannot be included in this format. \r\nc.\tThen, written public comments do not allow hearing or speech impaired or others to participate contemporaneously in meetings and have those records preserved.\r\n\r\nNARA justification is what? What is NARA\u2019s justification for disabling the YouTube chat comments, denying me this ADA accommodation and denying the public of my contemporaneous comments?\r\n\r\nContemporaneous YouTube Transcripts. OGIS/NARA may have also disabled the transcript feature in YouTube at times, so that one may not download it directly. Instead, NARA requires one to ask for the transcript (which NARA improperly edits before posting 90 days later and is not always a true copy). When I point out errors/deficiencies in NARAs meeting minutes etc., attributed to me, OGIS does not correct them.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nRecords Preservation.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a copy of this correspondenct to anyone who has contacted you on this matter or anyone who contacts you in the future. Please preserve this correspondence in the FOIA Advisory Committee and Chief FOIA Officers Council files. On that note, please preserve all recorsd related to my UD complants and the corresponding FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nThis includes records related to my UD complaint regarding potential destructon of records by then Acting Archivist Debra Wall realted to potential Hatch Act Violations who retied on November 8, 2023. Her retirement, as with others, does not negate NARA\u2019 requiremetn to presere responsive records, particularly since her records may be considered \u201ccapstone records.\u201d\r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s OIG found improper emails in 2026 and 2020 and referred Hatch Act violation complaints to the Office of Special Council. I submitted numerous FOIA requests seeking records related to potential 2020 Hatch Act violatoins by NARA leadership, which remain unanswered. All potentially responsive rcords must b preerved. NARA has a practice of classifying nearly all FOIA requests as COMPLEX and then waiting years to conduct searches, intentionally allowing emails and other records to be deleted.\r\n\r\n--/\r\n\r\nMr. Baker, NARA OIG.\r\n\r\nPlease review these matters and the attachemnts for potential investigation or audit.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to improve FOIA processes and the ability to participate for everyone.\r\n\r\nWith my deep respect,\r\n\r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\nFrom: FOIA Advisory Comm.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA\r\n\r\nGood afternoon. The Archivist asked OGIS to review and respond to your email. OGIS consulted with NARA's accommodations staff and have been advised that although the YouTube chat feature is not available, that does not limit the participation in the meeting for participants who are hearing or speech impaired. As you are aware, the public can register to participate through Webex and submit their chat comments to be read aloud, or, if able, ask for an opportunity to provide an oral public comment. The public can also submit written public comments before, during, or after the meeting.  Thank you for your interest in the FOIA Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAlina Semo\r\nChair, FOIA Advisory Committee\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, November 29, 2023 at 4:17:15\u202fPM UTC-5 foiacompliance@gmail.com wrote:\r\nMs. Colleen Shogan, Archivist of the United States:\r\n \r\nIn accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act that the Federal Register announcement for the December 7, 2023, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. EST FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting, I am seeking additional accommodation for persons who are hearing or speech impaired to have the YouTube chat comments turned on, thereby allowing all persons watching meeting to participate contemporaneously and have their comments preserved.\r\n \r\n \r\nI am providing a copy of this request to National Association for Hearing and Speech Action (NAHSA) and GAO and GSA who oversees the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The Archivist of the United States renewed the Committee's two-year charter in 2022.\r\n \r\nThe Federal FOIA Advisory Committee reports to the Archivist of the United States. The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) serves as the chair of the Committee, and OGIS staff provides administrative and logistical support.\u201d\r\n \r\n--/\r\n \r\nWith my deep respect,\r\n \r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n",

Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA.\r\nc.\tNARA (allegedly unlawfully) denied my request for special accommodation to have the YouTube chat comments turned on to allow all persons to participate contemporaneously and have their comments preserved for all who viewed the meeting via YouTube live or later. \r\nd.\tTo date there have been 1,800 views of the December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting YouTube video, meaning that 1,800 viewers have been deprived of my substantive contemporaneous comments and that I have been deprived of the opportunity to communicate them.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties.

Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA + FOIA Budgets\r\n\r\n[View as HTML]\r\n\r\nGreetings Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA Professionals, media, interested parties (1,200+).\r\n\r\nI felt compelled to provide detailed and forceful responses to NARA\u2019s mindless assertions in NARA\u2019s December 6, 2023 1:01 PM email below denying my simple request for ADA accommodation without any justification whatsoever, and to share this with you. Like me, you may have current and/or former co-workers, friends, and family that need this accommodation at any given time of having the YouTube chat function enabled, which NARA used to provide as a matter of routine without asking. This allows anyone to make contemporaneous comments to the meeting content and have them preserved for future viewers. To date there have been 1,800 views of the December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting YouTube video, meaning that 1,800 viewers (perhaps including you) have been deprived of my substantive contemporaneous comments and that I have been deprived of the opportunity to communicate them. \r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s actions are unjustified and indefensible - irreversible harm.  \r\n\r\nOne may conclude that the Archivist of the United States and NARA generally disfavor public participation highlighting needed increased funding and FOIA process improvements.\r\n\r\nThe attachments to this email deserve wide-spread distribution and preservation.\r\n\r\n--/\r\nThe FOIA Advisory Committee is essential to the functioning of our democracy. Since 1967, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. One of my Webex chat comments of interest to you, which I would have posted to the YouTube chat, involves agency top-line budgets for FOIA:\r\n\r\nAgency Top-line Budgets for FOIA. Also, every agency budget should have a top-line budget item for records management and FOIA, justified by how dismal performance and employee professional development retention are without the funding. This would be a game changer for beleaguered, overwhelmed FOIA staffs and a gift to our nation. FOIA Advisory Committee member David Cuillier, University of Arizona, and co-author Charles N. Davis, University of Missouri-Colombia of The Art of Access. Strategies for Acquiring Public Records wrote something like. \u201cI never hear of anyone being rewarded for releasing records under FOIA.\u201d  In my many years of federal service working side-by side with FOIA staff, I observed that despite their desires to serve the public interest, leadership thwarted release of embarrassing or threatening records.\r\n\r\n--/\r\nI am also including in this email my DOJ OIP compliance inquires related to my December 7, 2023 Expedited FOIA requests seeking the WEBEX video (NARA NGC24-082) and WEBEX chat comments (NARA NGC24-083) to the December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting, which are germane to my request for ADA accommodation for that FOIA Advisory Committee meeting.\r\n\r\nPlease see also my attached oral public comments to the recent September 29, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting addressing NARA\u2019s conduct of open FOIA meetings, including issues regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act and NARA\u2019s suppression of public participation in apparent violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. \r\n\r\nNothing has improved. Things have gotten worse. Please see my December 6, 2023 3:39 PM email below and attachments.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\n\u201cAn informed citizenry is at the heart of a dynamic democracy.\u201d - Thomas Jefferson        \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: foiacompliance@gmail.com <foiacompliance@gmail.com> \r\nSent: Wednesday, December 6, 2023 3:39 PM\r\nTo: 'FOIA Advisory Comm.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA\r\n\r\n[Best viewed as HTML]\r\nMs. Colleen Shogan, Archivist of the United States:\r\nMy guess is that you received correspondence from others regarding this matter. More may be coming.\r\nThe FOIA Advisory Committee reports to you, and you are responsible for ADA compliance and accommodation within NARA.\r\nNARA\u2019s inadequate December 6, 2023 1:01 PM email response below to my ADA request for simple accommodation:\r\n\u2022\tis materially inaccurate,\r\n\u2022\tdoes not provide accommodation to either hearing or speech impaired persons or the public in general, and \r\n\u2022\tdoes not provide any justification whatsoever for not accommodating my simple ADA request of turning on the YouTube chat comments to allow contemporaneous participation. OGIS goes out of its way to impede public participation in open FOIA meetings and worse. \r\nTherefore, this requires detailed and forceful responses to NARA\u2019s mindless assertions in NARA\u2019s December 6, 2023 1:01 PM email below.\r\nHAMMOND RESPONSES TO NARA\u2019S DECEMBER 6, 2023 DENIAL OF ADA ACCOMMODATION.\r\n1.\tWEBEX Chat. \r\na.\tNARA does not read all WEBEX chat comments aloud, including very substantive ones. Ms. Semo advises everyone at the start of the meeting not to submit substantive comments in the WEBEX chat and states (unlawfully in my view) they are not included in meeting minutes. Then OGIS (unlawfully in my view) destroys the WEBEX comments immediately (per NARA response to my FOIA request). Else, NARA is lying in its FOIA responses, which is of great interest to the FOIA Advisory Committee, the FOIA community and the public. See example Unauthorized Disposition (UD) complaint attached.\r\nb.\tDestruction of Records. NARA also destroys Chief FOIA Officer Council Records (and others) and does not publish or properly investigate UD complaints against NARA. (See Unauthorized Disposition of Federal Records _ National Archives - NARA TAB\u201d). Else, NARA is lying in its FOIA responses. See example relevant UD complaint attached. Not only are these violations of the underlying NARA UD policy (36 CFR Part 1230), but they are also violations of the Administrative Procedures Act in my view as a private citizen.\r\n\r\n2.\tOral Public Comments. \u201cif able, ask for an opportunity to provide an oral public comment.\u201d Not only does NARA routinely fail to call on me until I make a fuss, but how does \u201cif able\u201d accommodate my ADA accommodation request?\r\n\r\n3.\tWritten Public Comment. \r\na.\tNARA routinely (again in violation of multiple laws regulations and policies in my view) refuses to post my public comments. Compare the attached \u201cHammond Public Comments as of November 30 2023\u201d to the public comments posted to the FOIA Advisory Committee, Chief FOIA Officers Council and the OGIS Annual Open FOIA meeting. See also \u201cOGIS Posting Policy for Public Comments.\u201d\r\nb.\tNARA\u2019s new restrictive requirements limiting comments to 25,000 unformatted text-only characters massively diminishes what can be included. For example, my tables documenting massive NARA false FOIA reporting cannot be included in this format. \r\nc.\tThen, written public comments do not allow hearing or speech impaired or others to participate contemporaneously in meetings and have those records preserved.\r\n\r\nNARA justification is what? What is NARA\u2019s justification for disabling the YouTube chat comments, denying me this ADA accommodation and denying the public of my contemporaneous comments?\r\n\r\nContemporaneous YouTube Transcripts. OGIS/NARA may have also disabled the transcript feature in YouTube at times, so that one may not download it directly. Instead, NARA requires one to ask for the transcript (which NARA improperly edits before posting 90 days later and is not always a true copy). When I point out errors/deficiencies in NARAs meeting minutes etc., attributed to me, OGIS does not correct them.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nRecords Preservation.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a copy of this correspondenct to anyone who has contacted you on this matter or anyone who contacts you in the future. Please preserve this correspondence in the FOIA Advisory Committee and Chief FOIA Officers Council files. On that note, please preserve all recorsd related to my UD complants and the corresponding FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nThis includes records related to my UD complaint regarding potential destructon of records by then Acting Archivist Debra Wall realted to potential Hatch Act Violations who retied on November 8, 2023. Her retirement, as with others, does not negate NARA\u2019 requiremetn to presere responsive records, particularly since her records may be considered \u201ccapstone records.\u201d\r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s OIG found improper emails in 2026 and 2020 and referred Hatch Act violation complaints to the Office of Special Council. I submitted numerous FOIA requests seeking records related to potential 2020 Hatch Act violatoins by NARA leadership, which remain unanswered. All potentially responsive rcords must b preerved. NARA has a practice of classifying nearly all FOIA requests as COMPLEX and then waiting years to conduct searches, intentionally allowing emails and other records to be deleted.\r\n\r\n--/\r\n\r\nMr. Baker, NARA OIG.\r\n\r\nPlease review these matters and the attachemnts for potential investigation or audit.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to improve FOIA processes and the ability to participate for everyone.\r\n\r\nWith my deep respect,\r\n\r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\nFrom: FOIA Advisory Comm.

December 7, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting + ADA\r\n\r\nGood afternoon. The Archivist asked OGIS to review and respond to your email. OGIS consulted with NARA's accommodations staff and have been advised that although the YouTube chat feature is not available, that does not limit the participation in the meeting for participants who are hearing or speech impaired. As you are aware, the public can register to participate through Webex and submit their chat comments to be read aloud, or, if able, ask for an opportunity to provide an oral public comment. The public can also submit written public comments before, during, or after the meeting.

The 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of second-degree assault, second-degree assault of an officer and criminal mischief following the alleged crime spree that began at the U-Stop convenience store near 73rd Street and Pine Lake Road around 2:30 p.m. The man rammed several vehicles with the loader before driving to the Home Depot at 70th Street and Nebraska Parkway \u2014 about a third of a mile away \u2014 where he drove into more vehicles.\r\n\r\nI  am looking for body camera footage from responding officers, incident and investigative reports, 911 call detail logs, use of force reports, and dispatch audio of this incident.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

For transparency and public understanding, we seek evidence supporting these claims. Specifically, we request:\r\n\r\n1) Documentation or data supporting the statement that ALPR technology \u201chas become a critical and effective tool in both the prevention and investigation of crime has become a critical and effective tool in both the prevention and investigation of crime.\" This should include evidence showing the direct impact of ALPR technology on crime prevention and resolution in Skokie.\r\n\r\n2) Records or analysis that detail how the \"cameras collect and record objective information about passing vehicles such as license plate, vehicle color and body type and deposits this data in a secure searchable database.\" including any privacy safeguards in place for this data collection and storage.\r\n\r\n3) Evidence or reports that validate the claim \"Tapping into this rapidly growing network of data is a force multiplier and has had a dramatic effect on Skokie PD's ability to prevent and solve crimes.\" This should include specific examples or statistics demonstrating this impact.\r\n\r\n4) Detailed breakdowns or reports of the \"21,029,664 plate reads, approximately 11,801 searches, approximately 105 plates added to hotlists, and approximately 136,427 hotlist alerts\" mentioned in the agenda item. This should clarify the outcomes of these reads, searches, and alerts.\r\n\r\n5) Information on the \"129 investigations\" that were assisted by Flock ALPR technology in 2023, including how the technology contributed to these investigations, the nature of the crimes involved, and the results of these investigations, such as recoveries or arrests.\r\n\r\n6) Any audits, reviews, or assessments conducted by the Village of Skokie or external entities regarding the accuracy, effectiveness, and impact of the Flock Safety ALPR system in the community.\r\n\r\nCITATIONS:\r\n[1] Skokie Board of Trustees Regular Agenda Meeting Packet Dec 18, 2023 \r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20240109175006/https://www.skokie.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_12182023-1991>\r\n[2] U of M Ford School of Public Policy | Automated License Plate Readers: Legal and Policy Evaluation \r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20231208112551/https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/sites/stpp/files/2023-02/ALPR%20Memo%20Final%20Jan%202023_0.pdf>\r\nACLU Fast-Growing Company Flock is Building a New AI-Driven Mass-Surveillance System\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20231208034301/https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/legal-documents/flock_1.pdf>\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.

Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tFOIA Advisory Committee certified meeting minutes must be accurate. If they are not, it is explosive.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting.

This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020\tAccess and disclosure request files.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, correspondence, and documents on Leonid Leonidovich Vasiliev, aka L. L. Vasiliev (1891\u20131966). Dr. Vasiliev was a professor of physiology at the Institute of Brain Research at the University of Leningrad and served on the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has identified Dr. Vasiliev as a subject of interest in documents in its CREST system, available via its Electronic Reading Room. One such document titled \"Parapsychology in the USSR\" can be found in the CREST system under document number CIA-RDP96-00792R000500210002-8. A copy of that document can be found at the following link: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000500210002-8.pdf\r\n\r\nFor verification of Dr. Vasiliev's death, please see page 2 of document number CIA-RDP96-00792R000500210002-8 which states: \"After Vasiliev's death in 1966, the center of soviet parapsychological research partially shifted from Leningrad to Moscow, where IPPOLIT KOGAN, Director of the Section for Bioinformation on the totally soviet scientific and technical A.S. Popov Institute for Radiotechnology and Electrical Communication was located.\"\r\n\r\nAs further verification that the CIA has created records on Dr. Vasiliev, CIA-funded researchers and adjacent military institutions interacted with and/or monitored Dr. Vasiliev before and after his passing. \r\n\r\nDr. Stephen Abrams, spoke and corresponded with Dr. Vasiliev between at least 1962 and 1966. A report created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1965 states of Abrams: \r\n\r\n\"On January 4, 1965 ABRAMS contacted the U. S. Embassy, London, to report his tentative acceptance of a Soviet Government research grant covering two years work at the University of Leningrad and at this time he inquired as to what effect this acceptance would have on his American citizenship ... ABRAMS on this occasion revealed that he had been on close terms with a Czech scientist residing in Czechoslovakia and described as a 'staunch anti-Communist'. ABRAMS advised he met this scientist through a Soviet scientist, Professor (FNU) VASILIEV. ABRAMS also made one or more trips to the Soviet Bloc during which he had discussed with Professor VASILIEV the research grant he claimed to have, beginning the summer of 1965.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of Dr. Abrams's FBI file containing the above passage can be found at the following link: https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/fbifiles/historical/stephenabrams-fbi1.pdf\r\n\r\nPrior to the Soviet research grant referenced in the quoted passage, Dr. Abrams received funds through the CIA's Project MKULTRA, as part of subproject 136. This subproject, per a project proposal, ran from August 1961 through July 1962 and covered research into an \"Experimental Analysis of Extrasensory Perception.\" \r\n\r\nA copy of that project proposal can be found at the following link: https://archive.org/details/DOC_0000017395/page/n11/mode/1up\r\n\r\nThe CIA has publicly acknowledged Dr. Abrams's role in agency-funded MKULTRA research. In 2003 it approved the release of an article titled \"Parapsychology in Intelligence: A Personal Review and Conclusions\" by Dr. Kenneth A. Kress, originally published in volume 21, issue 4 of \"Studies in Intelligence\" (winter 1977). Footnote 2 on page 8 of this article identifies a draft report written by S. I. Abrams and titled \"Extrasensory Perception\", publication date December 14, 1965. Dr. Abrams is referenced by name in the following portion of the footnoted paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"In 1961, the  reports induced one of the earliest U. S. government parapsychology investigations when the chief of CIA's Office of Technical Service (then the Technical Services Division) became interested in the claims of ESP. Technical project officers soon contacted Stephen I. Abrams, the Director of the Parapsychological Laboratory, Oxford University, England. Under the auspices of Project ULTRA, Abrams prepared a review article which claimed ESP was demonstrated but not understood or controllable. The report was read with interest but produced no further action for another decade.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of that article can be found in the CREST system under document number CIA-RDP80-00630A000100010001-8 and at the following link: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000200030040-0.pdf\r\n\r\nDr. Vasiliev was a noted expert in the area of extrasensory perception (ESP), hence the correspondence between Abrams and Vasiliev. Dr. Vasiliev published a book on the subject of ESP, \"Mysterious Phenomena of the Human Psyche,\" in 1959, and it was later translated into English and published by New York University Press in 1965. Separately, the United States Air Force funded another translation in 1967 under AF 33(657)-16408. A copy of that translation with corresponding paperwork can be found at the following link: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0661891.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the CIA created records responsive to Dr. Vasiliev, given his interactions with Dr. Abrams and potentially other American researchers in the field of parapsychological research. Therefore, I am requesting all CIA records, correspondence, and documents on Leonid Leonidovich Vasiliev, aka L. L. Vasiliev.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Any agency interactions with Soviet researchers would help to broaden academic and public understanding of parapsychological research during the Cold War. Given the CIA's involvement in Project Star Gate, later known as Project Grill Flame\u2014a joint effort with the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Department of the Army involving remote viewing and ESP research\u2014records on Dr. Vasiliev would clarify how such research started and under what circumstances. Additionally, any such records on Dr. Vasiliev might potentially disabuse the public of some of the wilder conspiracy theories involving Project MKULTRA and Project Star Gate that have arisen since information on both was made available for public consumption.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
