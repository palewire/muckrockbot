He\r\n    was born in October 1962, although I am not sure of the date or place of his\r\n    birth. He died on 17 May 2011. At the time of his death, he lived in\r\n    Somerville, Massachusetts.

The request was for \"List of Individuals Banned from the Capital Building in Albany, NY\".\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\nA determination as to whether your request is granted or denied will be reached by or before October 12, 2023.\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.  When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: **\r\nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through Open FOIL.  Submitting a duplicate request takes time away from processing the hundreds of requests received each month.
