        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Video from the Otay Mesa Detention Center (OMDC) from March 1, 2023 - March 5, 2023, showing Cristian Dumitrascu, who died on March 5, 2023. \r\nSee: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrCristianDumitrascu.pdf. The primary custodian of this record is CoreCivic, which operates OMDC for ICE pursuant to a subcontract with the US Marshalls (CONT_IDV_70CDCR20D00000007_7012). \r\nCustodian(s) to task: \r\nUnder the ICE contract, CoreCivic is required to secure and preserve video of this type. The secondary custodian of this record is the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility's (OPR) External Reviews and Analysis Unit (ERAU), which maintains a SharePoint drive containing this video in association with its review of Mr. Dumitrascu's death and the associated report. The tertiary custodian is the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) San Diego Field Office, which may have facilitated the transfer of the video to ERAU death reviewers in March or April of 2023. \r\n\r\n2. Mr. Dumitrascu's ICE medical records. \r\nCustodian(s) to task: \r\nThese medical records are created and maintained by CoreCivic personnel at OMDC under the supervision of ICE ERO - IHSC Field Medical personnel. They will be in the possession of both OPR-ERAU in the aforementioned SharePoint drive and IHSC's Mortality Review Committee.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI make this request as a researcher with the Mami Chelo Foundation. https://mamichelo.org/. The Foundation holds Power of Attorney for Mr. Dumitrascu's family in Europe and are prepared to supply appropriate documentation upon request.  Headquartered in New York, New York (70 W 36th Street, Suite 12A, New York, NY 10018) Mami Chelo are gathering records from US-based agencies on his family's behalf and preparing a public-facing report regarding the circumstances surrounding his death.  I further make this request as an independent journalist working together with Mami Chelo to gather and disseminate information to the public and stakeholders regarding Mr. Dumitrascu's death. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nMami Chelo requests expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e). In support of expedited processing, I make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n1. ICE's only public-facing explanation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Dumitrascu's death appears in its Detainee Death Report (DDR): https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrCristianDumitrascu.pdf. \r\n2. The DDR does not identify a cause or manner of death for Mr. Dumitrascu.\r\n3. ICE has never revealed to Mr. Dumitrascu's family or the public any additional information it may have regarding how or why he died. \r\n4. The timeline ICE provided in its DDR does not match other records Mami Chelo has obtained. First, a 911 / CAD record indicates CoreCivic / ICE personnel did not call 911 for emergency medical treatment or notify authorities of Mr. Dumitrascu's death until 3:25 a.m. on May 5, 2023, despite the fact that ICE says a physician in La Mesa, California instructed paramedics to cease life-saving efforts and pronounced Dumitrascu deceased at 1:02 a.m. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24788176-dumitrascu-911-record-s001426-042424_e8392573_030523_mb2168_redacted-1\r\n5. The timeline ICE provided DHS-CRCL regarding when ALS efforts began appears to differ from the publicly available timeline in ICE's DDR, indicating a potential delay in care of at least five minutes: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24695164/2024-crfo-00207-crcl-records.pdf. \r\n6. These discrepancies, combined by the fact that CoreCivic personnel did not call 911 or promptly notify San Diego County Sheriff's Office personnel or the Medical Examiner of Mr. Dumitrascu's death, raise possible questions regarding the integrity of the government's reports and that of it contractor in relation to this death. See 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv). \r\n7. Raising additional questions regarding the government's integrity, Mami Chelo collected 8 statements from witnesses at OMDC who saw Mr. Dumitrascu on the morning he died, or were housed with him prior to his death. These witnesses reported CoreCivic shutting off facility phones, and CoreCivic and ICE abruptly transferring or deporting witnesses before they could be interviewed by government investigators. Several also reported a delay in emergency medical care by CoreCivic staff. \r\n8. A recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight revealed that ICE's own internal investigators documented a 50-minute delay in the arrival of emergency care during the previous death at Otay Mesa Detention Center -- that of Nebane Abienwi -- \"because the on-call medical provider at the detention facility did not respond to a nurse's request for authorization to call an ambulance.\" https://phr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/REPORT-ICE-Deadly-Failures-ACLU-PHR-AO-2024.pdf. It appears no ambulance was ever called for Mr. Dumitrascu. \r\n9. Deaths in ICE custody -- and particularly deaths in the custody of CoreCivic, one of ICE's largest detention contractors -- have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest. See, recently, https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detainee-deaths-prevented-aclu-report-says-rcna156815\r\nhttps://theconversation.com/ice-detainees-suffer-preventable-deaths-qanda-with-a-medical-researcher-about-systemic-failures-232817\r\nhttps://www.aclu.org/press-releases/95-percent-of-deaths-in-ice-detention-could-likely-have-been-prevented-with-adequate-medical-care-report\r\nhttps://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/\r\nhttps://www.upi.com/Voices/2024/06/28/ICE-detainees-preventable-deaths-systemic-failures/9731719579552/\r\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/ice-detainee-deaths-could-prevented-143029059.html\r\nhttps://prismreports.org/2024/06/25/nearly-all-deaths-in-ice-detention-over-5-years-were-preventable/\r\nhttps://houstonlanding.org/preventable-tragedy-ice-detention-deaths-could-have-been-avoided-report-finds/\r\nhttps://www.knkx.org/social-justice/2024-06-25/ice-detention-center-in-tacoma-among-those-with-highest-number-of-deaths-aclu\r\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/06/most-immigrant-deaths-in-ice-detention-could-have-been-prevented/ \r\nhttps://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2024/06/19/deaths-in-ice-detention-from-2017-2021-could-have-been-prevented/74141901007/\r\nhttps://www.kjzz.org/news/2024-06-25/new-report-finds-majority-of-immigrant-deaths-in-ice-detention-could-have-been-prevented\r\nhttps://www.aimspress.com/aimspress-data/aimsph/2024/1/PDF/publichealth-11-01-011.pdf\r\nhttps://truthout.org/articles/new-report-finds-nearly-all-deaths-in-ice-custody-over-5-years-were-preventable/\r\nhttps://whistleblower.org/press-release/latest-report-on-preventable-deaths-in-ice-custody-supports-whistleblower-disclosure/ \r\nhttps://www.davisvanguard.org/2024/06/report-charges-68-deaths-in-ice-custody-since-2017-highlight-systemic-issues/ \r\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2024/06/25/most-deaths-in-ice-custody-were-preventable-new-report-says/74201835007/ \r\nhttps://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/study-95-deaths-ice-detention-between-2017-2021-could-have-been-prevented \r\n10. More than 14,000 pages of government records reviewed by medical experts showed nearly all deaths in ICE custody could have been prevented, and ICE failed to properly investigate or punish contractors and medical providers for delays in care that caused people in custody to die. https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/\r\n11. A wrongful termination lawsuit filed against CoreCivic in February 2024 alleges the company was dangerously understaffed in the medical department during the period in which Mr. Dumitrascu died, leading to medical neglect: https://www.kpbs.org/news/border-immigration/2024/04/16/lawsuit-against-ice-detention-center-highlights-medical-neglect-complaints. \r\n12. According to DHS's FY 2023 FOIA report, ICE has reduced the number of FOIA processing personnel to its lowest levels since FY 2017 - just 47 total personnel, down from 60.5 in FY22. The agency reduced spending on FOIA processing by more than a million dollars - from $8.2M in FY22 to $7.2M in FY23. The agency's portion of DHS's total FOIA spending went from 11.4% in FY22 to 8.7% in FY23, despite the fact that the agency received 20,000 more requests than the previous fiscal year. Consequently, ICE's backlog more the doubled from 13k at the end of FY22 to 32k at the end of FY23. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/23_0325_fy23-FOIA_Annual_Report.pdf. Without expedited processing, Mami Chelo, Mr. Dumitrascu's family, and the public will likely wait years for a response to the very simply questions these records could answer about how and why he died.\r\n13. There is an urgent need to inform the public and Mr. Dumitrascu's family of the truth about how and why he died at OMDC, and whether other currently detained individuals are at risk of meeting a similar fate as Congress increases detention bed funding. The requested records are among the most reliable and compelling primary source documents available to do so. \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Mami Chelo respectfully requests expedited processing of this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Mr. Hefner was born in Chicago, Illinois. He served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946 and achieved the rank of private first class (PFC). The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Hefner, the founder of \"Playboy\" magazine, should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Hefner\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The term \u201cdocument\u201d includes both the principal document responsive to the request as well as any studies, exhibits, supporting documentation or supplement thereof.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 12,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O. Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX  77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",

This request includes all sent and received emails, attachments, and any other electronic communication from January 1, 2022, to the present.\r\nThis request encompasses all forms of communication, including but not limited to emails, letters, memos, and any other written correspondence.\r\nTo facilitate your search for these records, please ensure that the search includes any emails where Marshall W Hancock is either the sender or recipient, and the other party's email address ends with @warfighterhousing.com.\r\n\r\nI am an independent researcher investigating how housing allowances issued to service members on temporary duty status (TDY) are being used. This includes any formal or informal relationships between unit commanders/leadership and commercial housing providers, to include how leadership may be directing SMs to specific commercial providers and what incentives are being offered to do so. The purpose of my project is for developing a better understanding of how the government works after authorizing housing allowances to SMs on temporary duty status (TDY), what controls are in place at the unit level, and what protocols are in place to ensure taxpayer funded housing allowances are used as authorized.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of my research will be to produce a series of web-based essays using primary sources obtained by my FOIA requests. This final work product will be released with the aim of educating the public on the importance of temporary duty status (TDY) travel and the safeguards in place to protect against the potential for abuse.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid C",

Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
