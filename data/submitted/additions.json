        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nA copy of an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, \"Superstitions and Black Magic\". The report was issued by the OSS's Morale Operations (MO) branch sometime between January 1, 1943 and September 20, 1945, and dealt with the exploitation of superstition in psychological operations targeting the Axis powers of the Greater German Reich, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire of Japan. During the period between the creation of MO and the dissolution of the OSS, officers planned and/or carried out propaganda campaigns utilizing superstition as a key vector of attack; for reference, please see Operations Fantasia and Hermit in the Pacific Theater and OSS collaboration with Great Britain's Special Operations Executive in the promotion of German astrologist Louis de Wohl. This report is of public interest because it clarifies how the OSS overcame similar propaganda campaigns waged by the Greater German Reich during World War II.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation this request will interfere with any ongoing operations, nor should it reveal any current trade or defense secrets. The aforementioned operations occurred over 70 years ago, and the OSS ceased all operations in September of 1945.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Creem Magazine, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
