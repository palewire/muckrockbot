This memorandum is an updated version from that of February 15, 2024. At your request, and that of the Board President, this memo examines the remedy for: \r\n\r\n1. An unlawful leak from executive session of confidential and privileged information from executive session and from District lawyers to the Washington Educators Association (\u201cWEA\u201d) and Kent Educators Association (\u201cKEA\u201d) and directly to the public on Facebook; and, \r\n\r\n2. Directors\u2019 unexcused absence at special meetings, and de facto motion to amend the agenda in meetings where public hearings are conducted. \r\n\r\nBackground. The Board of Commissioners (\u201cBoard\u201d) held executive sessions pursuant to the Open Public Meetings Act, 42.30.110(1)(i)(iii) authorizing the Board to discuss the financial or legal consequences of a certain course of action with legal counsel, on 1.30.14, 2.7.14, 2.14.24. \r\n\r\nPreceding the meetings, the Board was given a conspicuously marked \u201cconfidential attorney client privileged\u201d memorandum from Stephen DiJulio at Foster Garvey, recommending isolating information related to collective bargaining information from Director Cook. The Board received electronic copies of the memorandum and draft Resolution (discussed in the memorandum). The Board was repeatedly advised verbally and in writing that no attorney-client privileged information and nothing from executive session should be released. Physical copies of both the DiJulio Memorandum and Resolution were recovered in Executive Session indicating the intention to keep the matters contained in both documents confidential. \r\n\r\nOn 1.30.14, Director Cook brought his lawyer (Mr. Musto) into executive session from the very law firm that is on retainer with WEA. Mr. Musto was immediately asked to leave the Executive Session. The firm is one of a few firms around the state funded and appointed to represent union members with claims arising from the CBA; and, that firm derives a steady income stream from the WEA member unions, such as KEA. \r\n\r\nThe Resolution itself was discussed only in Executive Session first on 1.30.24. At the conclusion of that executive session, the Board was told the matter was to be revisited on 2.7.24 specifically to incorporate the concerns expressed by Director Song. Director Song and Director Cook then failed to appear at the 2.7.24 meeting. Staff reset the matter for the executive session of 2.14.24 to ensure full debate on suggested edits from Director Song. Director Cook was late and did not participate in the discussion concerning the Resolution in executive session.\r\n\r\nUnlawful Waiver of Privilege and Dissemination of Confidential Communication. On or about 2.8.24, KSD Labor Negotiator (Christine Benedetti) was told by WEA leadership (Christine \u201cChristi\u201d Padilla\u201d) that the tentatively agreed upon ground rules would not be finalized due to the Resolution the Board was considering in Executive Session. The problem was \u2013 and remains- WEA nor KEA should never have seen or possessed attorney-client privileged information, let alone used it for an advantage at bargaining. The irony is that despite the best efforts of the Board, private information was leaked to the Union during the development of the very mechanism intended to prevent the dissemination such information. \r\n\r\nTo compound the problem, Director Cook then engaged in public discussion of the draft Resolution, which was private to that point. \r\n\r\nWithout notice, during open session of the Board on 2.14.24, Director Cook made a motion for the Board to pay his attorneys fees. There was no showing what the fees were for nor the amount of fees to be reimbursed, just a veiled suggestion that the fees were incurred by Mr. Cook as a result of the discussion of the Resolution. The existence of a draft Resolution itself was confidential, and the public citation of it in a motion was improper as it intentionally divulged attorney-client privileged information and matters directly from executive session.The motion failed. \r\n\r\nOn 2.14.24 Director Cook also made a motion to waive attorney-client privilege related to the Resolution. That motion failed. \r\n\r\nAfter the 2.14.24 meeting, a Go Fund Me page was established by a person named Alison Riley. She solicited cash from the public on behalf of Director Cook for the payment of Director Cook\u2019s private attorney bills. In doing so, she recited verbatim the motion that Director Cook made to have his attorney\u2019s bill paid by the District. The recital of confidential information on the Go Fund Me page was intended to gin up support for cash for the personal benefit of Director Cook. According to the Go Fund Me page, the release of confidential information and solicitation worked, netting Director Cook $700 or so at the time of this memo.\r\n\r\nOn 2.24.24 Resolution 1669 was published online to the public as required under our KSD policies and the OPMA, as it was an action item to be considered by the Board in open session. \r\n\r\nOn or around 2.25.24 an online call to arms was made by the WEA, stating the Board had a matter on the agenda that was \u201cnot labor friendly\u201d and the Board room was filled with a hostile KEA crowd at its 2.28.24. \r\n\r\nOn 2.28.24, prior to the Regular Board Meeting, Director Cook posted the Confidential Attorney-Client DiJulio Memorandum on a Facebook page called \u201cKSD Discussion page\u201d despite Director Cook\u2019s formal motion on the record to waive attorney-client privilege on the matter having been specifically denied a week prior by the Board. The posting was an apparent attempt to increase the opposition to the Resolution, an extension of that pressure from WEA president\u2019s call to arms. The Memorandum contained the legal basis for the Resolution, the risks attendant with the Board\u2019s inaction versus action, cited legal authority and potential PERC strategy that may be used by other labor unions against the interests of the Kent School District. Again, the memorandum stated conspicuously: \u201cConfidential Attorney-Client Privilege Applies\u201d yet Director Cook intentionally posted it online, deliberately indifferent to the Board\u2019s ruling to keep the such legal advice confidential. \r\n\r\nDespite opposition, on 2.28.24 the Board passed Resolution 1669 which prohibits Director Cook\u2019s participation in matters relating to collective bargaining. \r\n\r\nRemedies of the Board on the two issues. The first issue is procedural. The Board may review its ethics rules, attendance rules, etc. and modify them or address violations. For example, the Board may want to stress that its members do not have authority to bind the corporation to debt or hire outside consultants, attorneys, etc. and then submit vouchers or bills; or, it may wish to address whether a motion to modify a Board agenda immediately before a public hearing (where there is an audience waiting speak) should be prohibited. \r\n\r\nThe second issue of how to address the release of confidential and privileged information is more complex. The following are some options. \r\n\r\n1. Because the Resolution has passed, take no further action regarding Director Cook. \r\n\r\n2. Pass a censure Resolution against Mr. Cook for intentionally disclosing privileged information during the 2.14.24 open session and on Facebook presently. See attached draft. The conduct censured could be: \r\n\r\n\u2022 RCW 42.23.070. Intentional disclosure of privileged and confidential memoranda and information constitutes a crime under RCW 42.23.070 (\u201cNo municipal officer may disclose confidential information gained by reason of the officer\u2019s position, nor may the officer otherwise use such information for his or her personal gain or benefit.\u201d). \r\n\r\n\u2022 RCW 42.20.100. Intentional disclosure of privileged and confidential memoranda and information constitutes a crime under RCW 42.20.100 (\u201cWhenever any duty is enjoined by law upon any public officer or other person holding any public trust or employment, their willful neglect to perform such duty, except where otherwise specifically provided for, shall be a misdemeanor. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Breach of Fiduciary Duty. An unlawful waiver of attorney-client privilege, depriving the board of its rights and privileges as a represented party under rules governing the practice of law issued by the Washington State Supreme Court, RPC 1.6, and RCW 5.60.040. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Policy 1621 for failure to support the majority of the board upon its affirmative vote, in this case its decision to not waive the attorney-client privilege relate to the Resolution.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Policy 1815 \u201cactions or making decisions in the performance of their position in order to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends\u201d \r\n\r\n\u2022 Policy 1815 which requires board member objectivity, selflessness, financial stewardship, transparency, and integrity. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Sanctions may include: \r\n\r\no No further compensation nor stipend as a Director of the Kent School Board. \r\no No reimbursed or otherwise authorized travel at the expense of the District. \r\no Shall not hold a board office such as president, vice president or other for a period of two (2) years from the date of this resolution. \r\no Staff is directed to send a true and correct copy of this Resolution to applicable regulatory, law enforcement agencies, or both, together with any other relevant documents and shall cooperate fully with any subsequent investigations regarding the forgoing. \r\n\r\n3. Pass censure Resolution and Investigate via carrier. Work with the carrier to have them assign an outside investigator to determine how Ms. Padilla came into possession of purloined documents, or otherwise possessed stolen property. This would and should include an inquiry into criminal conduct under the Racketeering Influence Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), violations of RCW 42.23.070 releasing confidential information gained by virtue of affiliating with the agency, breaching the privilege under RCW 5.60, et. seq., and other prohibitions against leaking confidential information. \r\n\r\n4. Pass Resolution and investigate via outside counsel. If no investigator is assigned and funded, then consider hiring an outside counsel with experience in white collar crime investigations work, such as Orrick Herington and Sutcliffe. Scope of work and budgeting should be addressed up front. \r\n\r\n5. Post-Investigation Action. If there is a finding of wrongful conduct by an employee or elected official, take employment action necessary and / or censure, stripping of committee titles, and / or cutting off compensation. I do not make recommendations here regarding the (nonexclusive) options listed above. I trust the foregoing is helpful to determine a course of action, if any.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST\r\n\r\nMemorandum Page 3 part 2:\r\n\r\n\"2.

The contact information of enrolled students (including their cell phone numbers and email addresses) is a matter of public record. Under FERPA, it is considered \u201cdirectory information,\u201d along with other basic information like the student\u2019s email, major, dates of attendance and enrollment status. It is common for entities that want to advertise to students to request this publicly available contact information \u2014 everything from apartment complexes, to credit cards, to political candidates and so there is no exemption that will prevent release of this information unless individual cadets specifically sign a statement to have their information \u201cwithheld.\u201d Under federal law, directory information is not considered private unless students opt to withhold it from public disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",
