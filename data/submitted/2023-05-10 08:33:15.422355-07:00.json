        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to request information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, regarding the bandwidth usage and power consumption of the National Security Agency's (NSA) data centers. Specifically, I am requesting data on the gigawatt power consumption and bandwidth usage of the NSA's data centers listed below for the past three years:\r\n\r\nUtah Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah\r\nGeorgia Cryptologic Center in Augusta, Georgia\r\nTexas Cryptologic Center in San Antonio, Texas\r\nNSA Hawaii Cryptologic Center in Honolulu, Hawaii\r\n\r\nTo ensure a complete and thorough response, I would like to clarify that when I use the term \"any\" in my request, I am using it in the broadest sense to mean all records that meet the criteria specified in my request. I am not limiting my request to a specific type or subset of records, but rather seeking all records that contain the requested information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request that any responsive records be provided in a format that is accessible to individuals with disabilities, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Section 508 standards.\r\n\r\nWith that clarification, I request the following information:\r\n\r\nAny and all documents, including but not limited to reports, spreadsheets, or data tables, that contain information about the power consumption of the above-listed NSA data centers, including:\r\n\r\na. The total amount of power consumed by each data center on an annual basis for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nb. The sources of energy used (e.g., coal, natural gas, renewable sources) for each data center for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nc. Any efforts or initiatives by the NSA to reduce energy consumption or improve energy efficiency at each data center, including any plans or programs in place for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all documents, including but not limited to reports, spreadsheets, or data tables, that contain information about the bandwidth usage of the above-listed NSA data centers, including:\r\n\r\na. The total amount of data transmitted and received by each data center on an annual basis for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nb. The sources and types of data transmitted and received (e.g., voice, text, images, video) for each data center for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nc. Any efforts or initiatives by the NSA to reduce bandwidth usage or improve network efficiency at each data center, including any plans or programs in place for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all correspondence, including emails and memos, between NSA officials and other federal agencies, contractors, or private companies, regarding the energy usage or efficiency or bandwidth usage or efficiency of the above-listed NSA data centers, including any information related to the power consumption or bandwidth usage of these facilities.\r\n\r\nAny and all records, including but not limited to contracts or agreements, related to the procurement or purchase of energy or network equipment for the above-listed NSA data centers for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all records related to the maintenance or repair of equipment or systems related to energy usage or efficiency or bandwidth usage or efficiency for the above-listed NSA data centers for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that all responsive records are included, please conduct a search that includes all files, documents, and electronic data created or received by the NSA from January 1, 2018, to the date of your processing this FOIA request. If any responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please provide a detailed justification for each exemption and segregate any non-exempt portions for release.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to cite the following case law in support of this FOIA request:\r\n\r\nIn Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 923 F. Supp. 2d 237, 242-44 (D.D.C. 2013), the court held that energy usage data of government facilities was not protected by Exemption 3 or Exemption 4 of the FOIA and must be disclosed.\r\nIn Natural Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 191 F. Supp. 2d41, 54 (D.D.C. 2002), the court held that a request for information on energy usage and efficiency of government facilities is not unduly burdensome and must be processed under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the use of a Glomar response, I would like to state that the existence of responsive records is not classified or exempt from disclosure under FOIA. I am requesting information that is not classified or sensitive in nature, and the release of which would not harm national security or any ongoing investigation or operation.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request any and all internal directives or policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) regarding EOIR\u2019s process for contracting out, obtaining, and reviewing transcripts of hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ) for review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), as required by the BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.2(f). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request any current internal directives, manuals, memos, policy guidance, or other documents related to:  \r\n1.\tProcesses and procedures for assigning Digital Audio Recording(s) (\u201cDAR\u201d) to transcription contractors, including but not limited to Free State Reporting, Inc. (\u201cFree State\u201d), to be transcribed for purposes of creating the Record of Proceeding(s) (\u201cROP\u201d) for review by the BIA (see attached document for previous guidance, last updated in 2015)\r\n2.\tAny training, education, or certification EOIR requires of transcribers or the transcription companies with which EOIR contracts;\r\n3.\tAny policies and guidance regarding EOIR oversight and quality control over the transcription process, including any quality control checklists used by EOIR staff; \r\n4.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR takes when the transcription contractor sends back a defective or otherwise unsatisfactory transcript, for example one with significant typos, indiscernible notations, or other errors, including any processes for returning a defective or unsatisfactory transcript to the transcription contractor to be re-transcribed;\r\n5.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR and/or the transcription contractor takes when the DAR is partially or totally inaudible such that it cannot be properly transcribed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that EOIR waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding how and when immigration proceedings are transcribed for appellate purposes. CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations\u2014representing non-citizens before EOIR.  As a provider of legal services to non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients.\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is currently briefing a Petition for Review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in which defects in the transcript present a central issue on appeal. Information about the transcription process will help CAIR Coalition articulate legal arguments about our client's due process right to meaningful appellate review and advocate for broadly applicable law and procedures to be employed when a defective transcript is hindering review. Petitioner's opening brief to the Fourth Circuit is due on June 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",

The Supreme Court has recognized that FOIA \"reflects our nation's fundamental commitment to open government\" (New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971) and that the government has a \"heavy burden\" to prove that information should be kept secret (id.). FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed, and the government has the burden of proving that the information requested is exempt from disclosure (United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 1989).\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is as comprehensive as possible, I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nFlight Logs: Please provide all records related to the helicopter flight, including but not limited to flight logs that detail the flight paths and actions taken during the flight. These records should include information about the time of takeoff and landing, the duration of the flight, and any stops made during the flight.\r\nVideo Logs: Please provide all video logs captured by the helicopter's onboard cameras during the flight. These logs should include all footage captured during the flight, including footage of any stops made during the flight.\r\nTransmissions: Please provide all records of transmissions between the helicopter and ground personnel or any other parties during the flight. These records should include any audio recordings or written transcripts of these transmissions.\r\nMaintenance and Safety Records: Please provide any records related to the helicopter's maintenance and safety inspections, as well as the pilot's certifications and qualifications.\r\nWeather and Air Traffic Information: Please provide all weather and air traffic information that was available to the pilot during the flight.\r\nPilot Logbook: Please provide the pilot's logbook for the flight, which should include the pilot's flight hours, certifications, and qualifications.\r\nFlight Plan: Please provide the flight plan for the helicopter flight, including any revisions made to the plan before or during the flight.\r\nCommunications between DEP and Other Agencies: Please provide any records of communications between the DEP and other agencies related to the helicopter flight.\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: Please provide any body-worn camera footage that was recorded by DEP personnel during the flight, if available.\r\nRecords of Stops or Interactions: Please provide any records related to any stops or interactions that occurred during the flight, including but not limited to any reports or logs of interactions with members of the public or other agencies.\r\nThe courts have held that agencies must conduct a \"reasonable search\" for records responsive to a FOIA request, and that the adequacy of an agency's search is to be judged by the reasonableness of the efforts made, not by the results achieved (Electronic Privacy Information Center v. United States Department of Homeland Security, 2006). I would like to request that these records be provided to me in an electronic format, if possible, to reduce the cost and time associated with printing and mailing.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of these records is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, please provide an explanation of the basis for the exemption, consistent with the courts' holding that FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed and that the government has the burden of proving that information should be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "Your request FOIL-2023-826-02168 has been successfully submitted to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).\r\n                                The details of your request are shown below. \r\n \r\nRequest Title: Related to Helicopter Flight with Tail Number NY120NY \r\n \r\nRequest Description: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords Access Officer\r\nNew York City Department of Environmental Protection\r\n59-17 Junction Blvd.\r\n19th Floor\r\nFlushing, NY 11373\r\n\r\nDear Records Access Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to request access to detailed records related to the helicopter flight with tail number NY120NY that occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on May 9th, 2023, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\r\n\r\nFOIA was enacted to ensure that the public has access to information held by the government, subject to certain limited exemptions. The Supreme Court has recognized that FOIA \"reflects our nation's fundamental commitment to open government\" (New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971) and that the government has a \"heavy burden\" to prove that information should be kept secret (id.). FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed, and the government has the burden of proving that the information requested is exempt from disclosure (United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 1989).\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is as comprehensive as possible, I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nFlight Logs: Please provide all records related to the helicopter flight, including but not limited to flight logs that detail the flight paths and actions taken during the flight. These records should include information about the time of takeoff and landing, the duration of the flight, and any stops made during the flight.\r\nVideo Logs: Please provide all video logs captured by the helicopter's onboard cameras during the flight. These logs should include all footage captured during the flight, including footage of any stops made during the flight.\r\nTransmissions: Please provide all records of transmissions between the helicopter and ground personnel or any other parties during the flight. These records should include any audio recordings or written transcripts of these transmissions.\r\nMaintenance and Safety Records: Please provide any records related to the helicopter's maintenance and safety inspections, as well as the pilot's certifications and qualifications.\r\nWeather and Air Traffic Information: Please provide all weather and air traffic information that was available to the pilot during the flight.\r\nPilot Logbook: Please provide the pilot's logbook for the flight, which should include the pilot's flight hours, certifications, and qualifications.\r\nFlight Plan: Please provide the flight plan for the helicopter flight, including any revisions made to the plan before or during the flight.\r\nCommunications between DEP and Other Agencies: Please provide any records of communications between the DEP and other agencies related to the helicopter flight.\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: Please provide any body-worn camera footage that was recorded by DEP personnel during the flight, if available.\r\nRecords of Stops or Interactions: Please provide any records related to any stops or interactions that occurred during the flight, including but not limited to any reports or logs of interactions with members of the public or other agencies.\r\nThe courts have held that agencies must conduct a \"reasonable search\" for records responsive to a FOIA request, and that the adequacy of an agency's search is to be judged by the reasonableness of the efforts made, not by the results achieved (Electronic Privacy Information Center v. United States Department of Homeland Security, 2006). I would like to request that these records be provided to me in an electronic format, if possible, to reduce the cost and time associated with printing and mailing.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of these records is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, please provide an explanation of the basis for the exemption, consistent with the courts' holding that FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed and that the government has the burden of proving that information should be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter \r\n \r\n \r\nRequester's Contact Information \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Name: \r\n Jordan Lassiter \r\n \r\n Title: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Organization: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Email: \r\n  145590-70585521@requests.muckrock.com (mailto:145590-70585521@requests.muckrock.com) \r\n \r\n Phone Number: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Fax Number: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Street Address (line 1): \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Street Address (line 2): \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n City: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n State: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Zip Code: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\nYou can view the request and take any necessary action at the following webpage: https://a860-openrecords.nyc.gov/request/view/FOIL-2023-826-02168.

The City requests the following information to evaluate your fee waiver request:\r\n\r\n1) How do you or your organization intend to use the information?  (Please answer regarding the specific information requested as opposed to speaking generally regarding information on the general topic requested);\r\n\r\nThe emails obtained through this request may be used as the basis of an article on the ongoing deliberations about which gunshot detection firm to work with. \r\n\r\n2) How will the information benefit the wider public?  (Please explain how this specific information assists the public given the information already provided to the public on this topic);\r\n\r\nWe believe there is a strong public interest in reporting these matters, not least because Shotspotter/SoundThinking is a rapidly growing policing technology company on which hundreds of police departments rely and the company is working actively to secure a contract with the Portland Police Bureau. Because this is a public procurement process, the public has a strong interest in full transparency into this process and conversations that are happening between public officials such as the police and any vendors they are considering working with. \r\n\r\n3) How do you or your organization intend to disseminate the information to the wider public?\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the documents we will determine if they warrant coverage through some sort of journalistic work including but not limited to written articles, podcasts, or videos. \r\n\r\n",

My request pertains to reports, investigations, and litigation concerning incidents of sexual misconduct over the past five years.\r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting access to the following categories of information:\r\n\r\nIncident Reports: All incident reports or complaints of sexual misconduct involving students, including those filed by the students themselves or others on their behalf.\r\nInvestigation Outcomes: Detailed records of any investigations undertaken in response to these reports, including the findings (such as sustained, not founded, inconclusive, etc.), any actions taken by the university, and the outcomes of any subsequent appeals.\r\nLitigation: Records of all litigation and court proceedings related to these incidents of sexual misconduct. This includes not only the cases initiated by the university or individual students but also any related court cases that support the premise that such information should be released under FOIA, such as case law establishing or affirming the public's right to access this type of information.\r\nPolicy Changes: Any revisions or amendments made to the university's policies, guidelines, or procedures concerning sexual misconduct over the last five years in response to these incidents.\r\nAs allowed under the New York State Freedom of Information Law, I request that these documents be produced on a rolling basis, meaning as they become available. Pursuant to New York State Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I ask that the State University of New York at Albany make a good faith effort to provide the records as they are located and reviewed, rather than waiting to release all records at once.\r\n\r\nI am not requesting access to personally identifiable information or other confidential details that would infringe upon the privacy rights of individuals involved. Please redact such information in compliance with the law while still providing the relevant data about the incidents and their outcomes.\r\n\r\nIf any part of my request is denied, I kindly ask you to provide a written explanation citing the specific legal reasons for the denial. If any aspect of my request is unclear or needs further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Please find the amended request below:\r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) case files 105-HQ-83543 and 123-HQ-15685. A prior Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request, 1547783-000, was sent to the FBI for records on Christopher Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996), and the Bureau responded by identifying the aforementioned case file numbers as potentially responsive to the request and stating all subsequent records had been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Further, it recommended the filing of a FOIPA request through NARA's Special Access and Freedom of Information Act Program. Therefore, I am sending this request for access to FBI case files 105-HQ-83543 and 123-HQ-15685.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bird is identified in these records, there is no expectation of a violation of his privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords of the number of transfers conducted by DOCCS in 2020 and 2021. I understand that this information might be collected in different ways and have outlined specific requests in relation to what I anticipate might be possible below. If none of the below is possible or if records pertinent to prison transfers (i.e., movements) are collected/saved in a way that I have not captured, please contact me with more information. I am flexible and can modify my request to be responsive to the records that exist.\r\n\r\nREQUEST: \r\nI request information on movements/transfers between DOCCS facilities conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. This would include any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility\u201d as listed on DOCCS's \"Incarcerated Lookup,\" for example. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. This would not include movements such as: a temporary transfer to a hospital for a medical procedure; a temporary transfer to court for a court appointment; or a one-night or few-hour \u201cstop-over\u201d at a DOCCS facility on the way to another facility. \r\n\r\nIf movements/transfers are recorded in such a way as to distinguish movements that result in changes in housing facility from temporary movements, then I request records of every inter-facility, non-temporary (as described above) transfer made in 2020 and 2021. For each, I request the following insofar as is possible: \r\n\r\na)\tThe name of the sending facility \r\nb)\tThe name of the receiving facility\r\nc)\tThe date of the transfer\r\nd)\tThe reason for transfer \r\ne)\tAny transfer considerations, as recorded/described\r\nf)\tAny additional explanation of the causes for transfer, as recorded/described\r\ng)\tUnique identifier for each person transferred, if possible \r\n\r\nCONTINGENCIES: \r\nIf transfers are not disaggregated between temporary movements and non-temporary movements, then I request the above information for all movements. \r\n\r\nHowever these records are available is acceptable, with the priority being records that include the information listed above (including if this means requesting multiple types of records). \r\n\r\nFor example, if the information above is available in a summary table organized by day, week, month, or another unit of time, I request that summary table. Or, if it is available as redacted versions of transfer forms for each transfer, then I request those forms (such as form 8.6, \u201cTransfer Referral,\u201d KITSM86; or form 4.5.1 \u201cTransfer Review,\u201d KGNCM4B). In other words, I\u2019m flexible with what is available based on DOCCS record-making and record-keeping systems. If the above is impossible, please contact me to discuss what is available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIolanthe Brooks",

An example of an Initial Notification Summary for PM2.5 from EPA Region 9 has been attached to this request.\r\n2. Any acknowledgement or response from EPA to initial notifications or notification packages, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14 (Table 2).\r\n3. All submissions of demonstrations of exceptional events related to criteria pollutants, as submitted by state, local, or federal authorities.\r\n4. All subsequent responses and decisions communicated by the EPA, including approvals, denials or requests for more information, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14.\r\n\r\nWe request that all of these records be produced in their native electronic formats with any attached metadata included, so long as such electronic files can be opened using standard commercially available software. If the files cannot be produced in this manner, we request that records be produced in an alternative electronic format that is text-searchable. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B)\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in the Brown Institute, MuckRock, or California Newsroom\u2019s commercial interest, 45 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nDisclosure Is in the Public Interest\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the regulation of air pollution, which is harmful to human health. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(1). In particular, the requested information will shed light on exceptional events, a mechanism used by regulators to account for and exclude air pollution, information which is not \u201calready in the public domain.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(i). As a nonprofit organization assisting other news media organizations on coverage of federal government policy, we have demonstrated our \u201cability and intention to effectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees\r\n\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are a member of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are \u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nWe also ask that the information requested be disclosed on an expedited basis. Expedited processing is appropriate here because a \u201ccompelling need\u201d exists for disclosure of the requested information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public, there is \u201can urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a75.27(b)(2).\r\n\r\nAs a news organization, we are primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. Over the last several years, wildfires have grown, and with them, so has pollution from particulate matter and ozone. Climate change is a significant factor in the understanding of five of the six criteria pollutants, and understanding how criteria pollution overall is excepted is crucial to public understanding of the management of health risks. The information requested thus concerns \u201ca matter of exigency to the American public\u201d and \u201cthe consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest.\u201d Bloomberg, L.P. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 310 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). We therefore request that if the EPA determines that an exemption applies that it also provide specific reasons why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the EPA release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you have any questions or concerns about what we are seeking, please do not hesitate to contact us at the email address below. Pursuant to the applicable FOIA provision and departmental regulations, we expect a response regarding this request within the ten (10) working day time limit set by law. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.27(c); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrown Institute, MuckRock, and California Newsroom\r\n\u2105 Brown Institute for Media Innovation\r\n2950 Broadway\r\nNew York NY 10027\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Your request for Expedited Processing for the FOIA request EPA-R1-2023-004149 has been \r\n\t\t\tdenied. \r\n\t\tAdditional details for this request are as follows: \r\n \r\n  * Request Created on:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t05/09/2023 \r\n  * Request Description:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nThis is an expedited request by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, MuckRock, and the California Newsroom (\u201cBrown Institute,\u201d\u201cMuckRock,\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Newsroom\u201d) under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, for all submitted, denied and confirmed exceptional events related to criteria pollutants in EPA Region 1. A partial list of Example Submissions, Demonstrations and EPA responses prepared under the 2016 Exceptional Events Rule has been publicly posted by the EPA here: https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/example-demonstrations-and-epa-responses-prepared-under-2016-exceptional \r\n\r\nDocument Request \r\n\r\nWe seek copies of the following records submitted to and prepared by the EPA Regional Office between September 30, 2016, through May 08, 2023: \r\n\r\n1. All initial notification packages created by state, local, or tribal agencies now held by the EPA Regional Office. By this language, we intend to include emails or any other records of communication containing, for example, the potential date of event, relevant criteria pollutant, location, and potential regulatory decision affected (such as designation, classification, attainment determination, attainment date extension, or finding of SIP inadequacy leading to SIP call). An example of an Initial Notification Summary for PM2.5 from EPA Region 9 has been attached to this request. \r\n2. Any acknowledgement or response from EPA to initial notifications or notification packages, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14 (Table 2). \r\n3. All submissions of demonstrations of exceptional events related to criteria pollutants, as submitted by state, local, or federal authorities. \r\n4. All subsequent responses and decisions communicated by the EPA, including approvals, denials or requests for more information, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14. \r\n\r\nWe request that all of these records be produced in their native electronic formats with any attached metadata included, so long as such electronic files can be opened using standard commercially available software. If the files cannot be produced in this manner, we request that records be produced in an alternative electronic format that is text-searchable. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B) \r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request \r\n\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in the Brown Institute, MuckRock, or California Newsroom\u2019s commercial interest, 45 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii). \r\n\r\nDisclosure Is in the Public Interest \r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the regulation of air pollution, which is harmful to human health. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(1). In particular, the requested information will shed light on exceptional events, a mechanism used by regulators to account for and exclude air pollution, information which is not \u201calready in the public domain.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(i). As a nonprofit organization assisting other news media organizations on coverage of federal government policy, we have demonstrated our \u201cability and intention to effectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii). \r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees \r\n\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are a member of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are \u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees. \r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing \r\n\r\nWe also ask that the information requested be disclosed on an expedited basis. Expedited processing is appropriate here because a \u201ccompelling need\u201d exists for disclosure of the requested information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public, there is \u201can urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a75.27(b)(2). \r\n\r\nAs a news organization, we are primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. Over the last several years, wildfires have grown, and with them, so has pollution from particulate matter and ozone. Climate change is a significant factor in the understanding of five of the six criteria pollutants, and understanding how criteria pollution overall is excepted is crucial to public understanding of the management of health risks. The information requested thus concerns \u201ca matter of exigency to the American public\u201d and \u201cthe consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest.\u201d Bloomberg, L.P. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 310 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). \r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions \r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). We therefore request that if the EPA determines that an exemption applies that it also provide specific reasons why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the EPA release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. \r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you have any questions or concerns about what we are seeking, please do not hesitate to contact us at the email address below. Pursuant to the applicable FOIA provision and departmental regulations, we expect a response regarding this request within the ten (10) working day time limit set by law. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.27(c); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I). \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nBrown Institute, MuckRock, and California Newsroom \r\n\u2105 Brown Institute for Media Innovation \r\n2950 Broadway \r\nNew York NY 10027 \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDillon Bergin \r\n  * Expedited Processing Original Justification:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRequest for Expedited Processing \r\n\r\nWe also ask that the information requested be disclosed on an expedited basis. Expedited processing is appropriate here because a \u201ccompelling need\u201d exists for disclosure of the requested information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public, there is \u201can urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a75.27(b)(2). \r\n\r\nAs a news organization, we are primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public.

I have compelling reasons and evidence that you are attacking civilians with psychological torture techniques, including stalking, gangstalking, harassment, and intimidation. \r\n\r\nI am part of a larger group representing the interests of more than 2,500 Targeted Individuals (\"Non-Investigative Subjects\").  We demand an explanation for these activities and compensation for pain, suffering, and illegal torture.  A similar letter has been sent to General John Raymond at the Air Force Space Command, where he is involved with illegal satellite tracking and microwave weapons.\r\n\r\nWe have sworn affidavits from 2 FBI agents, confirming that this illegal program is occurring. We have the training manual for gangstalking, and we have the FBI's secret manual, covering these covert operations. We have statements from 25 Medical Doctors confirming that this program exists.\r\n\r\nYou can be sued in a Civil Court for your criminal activity.\r\n\r\nI demand that you immediately CEASE AND DESIST your illegal activities, including the use of government personnel and external groups, such as Infragard and Citizen Corps, which may also be participating.  Such operations are in violation of Article 32 of the Geneva Conventions (psychological torture) and numerous Federal & State laws.\r\n\r\nThis CEASE AND DESIST ORDER is to inform you that your harassing, stalking, and intimidation actions are illegal and will not be tolerated. I demand that you immediately CEASE AND DESIST.  Should you continue to pursue these activities in violation of this CEASE AND DESIST ORDER, I will not hesitate to pursue legal action against you.\r\n\r\nThis CEASE AND DESIST ORDER demands that you immediately discontinue and do not at any point in the future, under any circumstances, do the following: pursue, harass, attack, strike, bump into, brush up against, push, tap, grab, hold, threaten, telephone (via cellular or landline), instant message, page, fax, email, follow, stalk, shadow, disturb the peace, keep under surveillance, hack electronic devices, gather information about and/or block movements at home, work, social gatherings, in public areas, or religious functions.\r\n\r\n You may have already violated numerous Federal & State laws, including:\r\n\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2381;  Treason.\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2340; (c) Conspiracy to commit torture.\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2382;  Misprision of Treason.\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2384;  Seditious Conspiracy.\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2389;  Recruiting for service against the United States.\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 241;  Conspiracy to Deprive Constitutional Rights;\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 242;  Deprivation of Constitutional Rights;\r\n-  18 USC \u00a7 2261A Interstate Stalking,\r\n-  18 USC \u00a7 875(c) Interstate Communications,\r\n-  47 USC \u00a7 223(a)(1)(c) Harassing Telephone Calls\r\n-  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1961; Organized Crime Control Act of 1980. (RICO)\r\n-  Numerous other State and City codes.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to continue your current activities, I will not hesitate to file complaints and publicly expose your ongoing criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of my position, nor is it a waiver of any rights or remedies in this or any other related matter.  I insist on your immediate compliance, and expect a written response within two weeks.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\n \r\nTargeted Individual\r\nTargetedJustice.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID HT001122F0085, for a delivery order given to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC (UEI: C1HBCJ9RMBV3) in the research area of \"SERVICES FOR PHYSICS-BASED MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND TEST FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF UNCONVENTIONALLY ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY.\" This contract was awarded by the Department of Defense through the Defense Health Agency on behalf of the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command and has an action date of September 13, 2022 . This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC and/or its parent entity, The Johns Hopkins Univeristy (UEI: FTMTDMBR29C7)\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into the physical effects of directed energy attacks, as currently there is a concern among the members of the media and the public about so-called anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2016, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents under the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC has been awarded contracts or grants covering similar research areas by the Department of Defense; award IDs N0002420F8124 and N0002421F8162 are active with the Naval Sea Systems Command as of May 2023 for work on \"directed energy bio effects.\" This request would contribute to public understanding of how the government is handling research on anomalous health incidents and unconventionally acquired brain injuries.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

After this interview he was seen on CCTV just outside of the police station in a car. The CCTV footage then showed Aaron breaking his phone and collecting a new phone from his lawyer. This footage was then shown at his trial.\r\n\r\nIf possible could you send me all of the video and photo evidence that was presented at the Odin Lloyd murder trial? For example footage of Aaron at a gas station before the murder, footage of Odin Lloyd being picked up by Aaron as well as footage of Aaron arriving home with a gun on him.\r\n\r\nI also kindly ask for the footage of his police interview as well as the CCTV footage of him breaking his phone.\r\n\r\nAll in all I\u2019d like every single video exhibit that was presented at the Odin Lloyd trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I am asking for all of this is because I believe that there are important life lessons to be learned from this appalling crime.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event the County shall choose to withhold any such documents, pursuant to Govt Code \u00a7 6255, the County shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of the Act or that on the facts of this particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. Pursuant to Govt Code \u00a7 6253, if the County feels a portion of a record should be withheld because it feels that portion is exempt, then any reasonably segregable portion of the record shall be made available after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law. \r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling this request. We would prefer that the request be fulfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the Act requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
