In any case, please provide the records by electronic means only, not by post.\r\n\r\nIf you do not possess the record, or don't know whether it exists, please indicate what U.S. agencies are most likely to possess it, or determine whether it exists, for the purposes of FOIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Has the President issued any proclamation under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 441(a) with regard to the war?\r\n2. Are there any \"rules and regulations \u2026 prescribed\" under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 445(a) with regard to the war?\r\n3. What is the definition of \"American republic\" as used in 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 449?\r\n4. Had the President issued any proclamation under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 451 with regard to the war?\r\n5. Are there any \"rules and regulations\" \"promulgate[d]\" under 22 U.S. Code \u00a7 453 with regard to the war?\r\n6. Are there any other U.S. laws (including regulations, statutes at large, etc) that prohibit such participation in the war? In particular, do the 1794 Neutrality Act, Neutrality Act of 1935, Neutrality Act of 1939, and/or 22 U.S. Code ch. 9 prohibit such participation?\r\n7. With regard to any such participation, has DoJ, or will DoJ,\r\n  a. pursue(d) charges under such laws? If yes in past tense, what are the 3 most recent such cases which are not sealed (in standard legal citation form, e.g. \"US v Smith, No. 23-cr-123 (X.D. State Y)\", or in the form of the CM/ECF stamped indictment, complaint, or equivalent)? If yes in future tense, under what conditions would such participation be charged or not (specific to the war or the participation, i.e. not including generic conditions applicable to all criminal charges like sufficiency of evidence)?\r\n  b. issue(d) a nolle prosequi or other express guarantee against such charges \u2014 or been aware of any such guarantee issued by a government entity other than DoJ (e.g. State Dept. or President) \u2014 either individual or general? If yes, what are its conditions (if any)?\r\n \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.

        "communication": "To New Orleans Police Department: \r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Louisiana Public Records Law. My name is Sarah Jones, and I am a resident of Louisiana. \r\n\r\nRequested Records\r\n\r\nI request all agency records from September 2014 to the present concerning Tweets deleted or drafted and not sent from the @NOPDNews account associated with the New Orleans Police Department. \r\n  \r\nI believe the records that I are located, inter alia, within agency headquarters, in email records, and in third-party platforms used to manage the Agency\u2019s social media accounts.\r\n\r\nThe records I request include, but are not limited to:\r\n1.\tRecords of all tweets deleted by the Twitter handle associated with the New Orleans Police Department (@NOPDNews), including:\r\n\r\na.\tAny tweets that were published on Twitter and subsequently deleted for any reason; and\r\n\r\nb.\tAny tweets published by other accounts that were retweeted by @NOPDNews and subsequently deleted for any reason.\r\n\r\n2.\tRecords of all tweets that have been kept in draft form beyond their expected date and time of publication, on Twitter or in a third-party social media management platform, for any reason. \r\n\r\n3.\tRecords related to the drafting or deletion of tweets, including:\r\n\r\na.\tAny correspondence or record of correspondence regarding the drafting or deletion of specific tweets\r\n\r\ni.\tincluding correspondence sent through official government email addresses or messaging services; and\r\n\r\nii.\tincluding correspondence sent through private third-party services such as Gmail or Slack; and\r\n\r\niii.\tIncluding any messages, notes, or annotations created on a third-party social media management platform.\r\n\r\nb.\tDocumentation of the agency\u2019s existing policy regarding the preservation and maintenance of tweets as per the Federal Records Act, and Federal Records Management Bulletin 2014-02 (available at https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2014/2014-02.htm), which stated that \u201csocial media content may be a Federal record when the use of social media provides added functionality, such as enhanced searchability, opportunities for public comment, or other collaboration\u2026 A complete Federal record must have content, context, and structure along with associated metadata (e.g., author, date of creation). The complete record must be maintained to ensure reliability and authenticity.\u201d\r\n\r\nc.\tAny briefings, reports, memoranda, legal opinions, policy statements, or talking points used or disseminated within the Agency regarding the drafting or deletion of tweets.\r\nI urge the NOPD to process this request consistent with \u201ca general philosophy of full agency disclosure [under FOIA] unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language,\u201d United States Dep't of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 494 (1994), and the Justice Department\u2019s policy directing a presumption of disclosure. See Dep\u2019t of Justice Office of Information Policy, President Obama\u2019s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder\u2019s FOIA Guidelines: Creating a \u201cNew Era of Open Government\u201d (2009), available at https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-creating-new-era-open-government). \r\n\r\nRequest for Public Interest Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest. It \u201cis likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the activities or operations of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nFirst, the records concern the operations or activities of the government. Government social media accounts are used to disseminated information to the public, make official pronouncements, and generally serve as an important touch point for governments to receive public input. See Social Media Use by Governments: A Policy Primer to Discuss Trends, Identify Policy Opportunities and Guide Decision Makers, OECD Working Papers on Public Governance, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxrcmghmk0s-en. Social media use, including tweets posted by @SocialSecurity and then deleted, or never posted, is an important part of this activity.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Specifically, the requested records will reveal substantial new information about how the New Orleans Police Department defines and manages tweets. They will allow the public to see what published messages have been rescinded and the process by which these public statements were retracted as compared to the processes employed by other agencies.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I respectfully request that the New Orleans Police Department grant a public interest fee waiver for this request, and that all fees related to the search, review, and duplication of the requested records be waived. If the fees will not be waived, I agree to pay up to $2 for the processing of this request. If the estimated fees will exceed this limit, please inform me before you begin processing.\r\n\r\nI request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format, if possible. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. \r\n\r\nSarah Jones",

        "communication": "To Louisiana State Police: \r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law, I am seeking access to records related to the law enforcement response at Tulane University during the protest and subsequent encampment between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. This protest was part of a wider movement related to the conflict in Gaza and has been noted for its significant impact on campus safety and public expression.\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\nDigital Documents:\r\n\r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest and the subsequent encampment that spread onto St. Charles Avenue\u2014which constitutes public property. \r\n\r\nLegal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. I am requesting body cam footage from all Louisiana State Police officers sent to Tulane University and the area between Jefferson Ave/St. Charles to Lowerline St./St. Charles Avenue between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest, the subsequent encampment, and the dissolving of the encampment between April 28, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\n\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest, the encampment, and the broader Tulane University between April 29, 2024 and May 2, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\n\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\n\r\nPhysical Documents: Incident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest and in the aftermath of the encampment\u2019s dismantling between April 28, 2024 and May 11, 2024. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nOperational Plans: Documents issued between March 2020 and May 2024 detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing protests, including any internal documents or memoranda related to how to engage with protests involving New Orleans Police Department, Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, Tulane University Police, Tulane University students, and other Tulane community members. \r\n\r\nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\n\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression. The release of these records will enhance public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any potential fees associated with the processing of this request. I request a waiver of all fees as this disclosure is primarily in the public interest, contributing substantially to the understanding of government operations and is not for commercial purposes. I prefer to receive the documents electronically, via email or on a CD-ROM if electronic transfer is impractical.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Contact:\r\n\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe prescribed by law. Should you require any clarification or have questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt and thorough handling of this request, as dictated by applicable laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSarah Jones",

Please describe what incident occured. Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \n\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components.  Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions.  A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online:  https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information.  If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office.  Otherwise, respond back with your additional information. \n\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.
