DOCCS\u2019s own directives indicate such records are maintained, including:\r\n\u2022 Directive 2700 (Budget & Finance), which describes a department-wide spending plan that divides funds among facilities and regions; and\r\n\u2022 Directive 2915, which refers to facility operating funds and purchases funded from the facility\u2019s operating budget.\r\n\r\nIf no \u201cbudget\u201d record exists at the facility level, please provide the facility-level operating expenditure (actuals) reports for the same year.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAkash Mehta",
