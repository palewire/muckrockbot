        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAccording to documents obtained from previous records requests, two CBP agents (Morales and Mu\u00f1iz) in Puerto Rico exchanged calls with municipal police officer Jose F. Toro Segarra on or around May 25, 2025 concerning Dominican migrant Aracelys Terrero Mota. \r\n\r\nA copy of this record has been submitted alongside this records request.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1)  All instructional materials, presentations and presentation materials (including recorded video and audio, PowerPoint files, prepared remarks, and slides formats), and other guidance relating to communications between CBP and the Cabo Rojo municipal police about Aracelys Terrero Mota. This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed communications with municipal police, Aracelys Terrero Mota, and/or her arrest by CBP, B) any explanations (whether internally or externally generated) about communications with municipal police, Aracelys Terrero Mota, and/or her arrest by CBP, and C) any other document that has been used to help explain communications with municipal police, Aracelys Terrero Mota, and/or her arrest by CBP, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any digital communications (including but not limited to emails and text messages), as well as documents (including but not limited to PDF, word processing, excel, and slide documents) that mention Aracelys Terrero Mota or her arrest on or around May 27, 2025 exchanged with the Cabo Rojo municipal police. \r\n\r\n3) Any case reports or after action reports mentioning Aracelys Terrero Mota.\r\n\r\nTo aid in your search, potentially responsive documents will likely exclusively be found with the offices of CBP agents working in Puerto Rico within the Ramey Sector. \r\n\r\nTo aid in your search, please use the following keywords:\r\n\"Aracelys\" \r\n\"Terrero-Mota\"\r\n\"Aracelys Terrero Mota\"\r\n\"Cabo Rojo\"\r\n\"Toro Segarra\"\r\n\"Martinez Acosta\"\r\n\"Santiago\"\r\n\"Mu\u00f1iz\"\r\n\"Morales\"\r\n\r\nThis records request is for all records produced between May 24, 2025 and August 1, 2025. In the case there are multiple records, please send them to me on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. Any documents produced from this request will be used in the course of reporting about immigration for Heavy Weather, an independent newsletter about Puerto Rico. www.heavyweather.media.com\r\n\r\nI am formally requesting expedited processing of my FOIA request submitted to your agency. My request seeks records related to Operation Cupid's Nest, an immigration enforcement operation taking place in at least one airport in the United States. The information is critical to inform the public about ongoing immigration enforcement actions currently taking place across the United States that may impact air travel at a time when both immigration and transportation are issues that are constantly in the news media every day. I believe this request qualifies for expedited processing under criteria outlines in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and the implementing regulations of your agency.\r\n\r\nJustification for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\n1) Compelling Need for Urgency: There is a compelling need for the timely release of the requested records due to undocumented immigration and air travel being matters of significant public interest at this time. The information sought is critical to informing the public about how federal agencies deal with undocumented immigration and detained undocumented immigrants, as well as how these operations are taking place across airports in the United States.\r\n\r\n2) Public Interest: The requested records pertain to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest and concern to the general public. Specifically, records relate to the arrest of undocumented migrants, an issue that has been the subject of extensive media coverage and public debate. Expedited processing is necessary to ensure that the public is informed about this issue in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n3) Risk of Irreparable Harm: Delay in processing this request could result in irreparable harm. For example, the requested records are needed to address the ongoing issue of undocumented immigration that has significant consequences for public safety, civil liberties, or government accountability, especially since it is related to how federal agencies are responding to this issue. Without expedited processing, the value of the requested information may be significantly diminished.\r\n\r\n4) Statutory and Regulatory Criteria: My request meets the statutory and regulatory criteria for expedited processing. My request is a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exists an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity. My request has a compelling need for the information to address a pressing issue of public concern.\r\n\r\nI respectfully urge your agency to grant expedited processing for this FOIA request to ensure timely access to the requested records. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to upholding the principles of transparency and accountability under the FOIA. Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me at carlosBP@protonmail.com if you require additional information or clarification regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\no Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe public should have access to any unedited audio or visual recordings of ICE's enforcement operations in California between January 6, 2025 to the present. Since at least 2010, ICE has created and made public hundreds of videos of various internal agency operations, including arrests, detention, and removals. Recently ICE and accompanying agencies have released videos of operations in Los Angeles that have included a raid on MacArthur Park. Videographers accompanied the agency, and the content was shared across multiple platforms. Other operations have been videotaped and shared online by the agency. On one publicly available website, ICE videographers have uploaded videos of agency actions. Given ICE's widespread practice of recording its operations, additional and unedited recordings of ICE operations in California likely exist but have not been made public. These videos contain important information about the tactics used when arresting noncitizens and whether ICE officers are acting in a manner consistent with ICE's own protocols and state and federal due process laws. Because these video and audio records contain information about a critical government function on a matter of significant public interest and concern, FOIA mandates their disclosure.\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\n\r\n1. Visual recordings taken by the department or contracted videographers of ICE operations to share on social media, advertising, and with news outlets, including arrests, detention, and removals, in Los Angeles between January 6, 2025, to the present. \r\n\r\nThe Requestors:\r\n\r\nJoey Scott and Jeremy Lindenfield are both journalists who work in news gathering, including written and visual reporting. Joey Scott is a freelance investigative journalist in Los Angeles. Jeremy Lindenfield is a journalist for Capital and Main news.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe Requestor seeks a full fee waiver on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest and is \"likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). As set forth above, this request aims to further public understanding of ICE programs and practices that directly affect untold numbers of noncitizens as well as members of the public captured in video recordings of ICE enforcement actions. These policies and practices are of interest to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe public interest fee waiver provision \"is to be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.\" McClellan Ecologic Seepage Situation v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1284 (9th Cir. 1987). The relevant question is whether the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, good or bad. See judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Disclosure of the information and report sought is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the treatment of immigrants during enforcement actions. The requested records also relate directly to government operations, including the use and storage of video files that potentially implicate fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to privacy. The requested records also relate to the relationship between the federal government and private, for-profit contracted entities.\r\n\r\nThe records are not sought for commercial use, and the Requestor plans to disseminate the information disclosed through print and other media to the public at no cost. As demonstrated above, the Requestor has both the intent and ability to convey any information obtained through this request to the public and is therefore entitled to a full fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nShould the request for a full fee waiver be denied, Requestor also seeks a limitation of processing fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) (\"fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by ... educational or noncommercial scientific institution ... or a representative of the news media\") and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(d)(1) (search fees shall not be charged to \"representatives of the news media\"). Requestor is a non-profit organization that intends to disseminate the information gathered by this request to the public at no cost, including through the Requestor's website and social media. The Requestor may publish a news story or other publication on the government's treatment of immigrants based on information gathered through this FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request has been reviewed in two parts:\r\n\r\nPart A \u2013 Calls for Service (Las Vegas Convention Center)\r\nTo obtain a list of calls for service\u2014including 911 Calls for Service, Communications Record Reports, or Phone and Radio Search & Reproduction\u2014you will need to contact our Communications Research Office.\r\n\r\nRequests may be submitted:\r\n\r\n  *   In person at LVMPD Headquarters or any LVMPD substation, or\r\n  *   Through the Communications Bureau Records Online Portal\r\n\r\n  *   Public Records | Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department<https://www.lvmpd.com/i-want-to/file/public-records>\r\n\r\nFor assistance, please contact the Communications Research Office directly at (702) 828-3871.\r\n\r\nOnce you have obtained event numbers from the Communications Research Office, you may submit a follow-up public records request with those specific event numbers, and we will be happy to assist in retrieving any related reports or materials that are eligible for release.\r\n\r\nPart B \u2013 Incident Involving Detention/Arrests at or Near the Venetian Hotel\r\nYour request appears to be non-specific and overbroad, as it does not identify a particular record or case. Under Nevada law and relevant legal guidance, a valid public records request must reasonably describe an identifiable public record.\r\n\r\nCourts have held that public agencies are required to disclose only \u201cidentifiable governmental records,\u201d not broad or vague requests for general information to be analyzed or compiled by the agency. See:\r\n\r\n  *   Hodai v. City of Tucson & Tucson Police Dep\u2019t, 2014 Ariz. Super. LEXIS 2158, *18 (2014)\r\n  *   MAG Entertainment, LLC v. Division of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067, 1076 (N.J. App. Div. 2005)\r\n  *   Capitol Information Association v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985)\r\n  *   See also NAC 239.863(1)(c) (requiring sufficient description to identify a record)\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Public Records Unit is unable to identify a specific record based on the information provided.\r\nIf you are able to provide additional details\u2014such as a case number, event number,  exact date/time, or the full names of involved individuals\u2014we will gladly re-review the request.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us with any clarification or updates. We're happy to assist further when specific records can be identified.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Records Unit\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\r\n400-A South Martin L.

The child was taken to Scotland and the father had no contact for over 12 months. \r\n\r\nThis incident appears to have involved violations of federal law under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204 among other crimes.\r\n\r\nFee waiver requested under victim rights, public accountability standards, and exercise of civil rights.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRegarding an interaction with Thomas Henschel on 01/25/2013:\r\n- All incident, dispatch log entries and arrest reports. Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
