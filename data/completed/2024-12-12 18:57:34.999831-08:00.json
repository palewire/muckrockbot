I\u2019m reaching out to ask about and obtain any materials the school is making or preparing in order to educate students about these images or the consequences o making them.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n1) Any lesson plans, curriculum plans, assembly plans, or presentation plans held by this school district that discuss AI generated fake nude images/deepfakes, or the apps that create these images. If you need a query search, you can search for materials that mention \u201cAI\u201d OR \u201ca.i.\u201d OR \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d OR \u201cdeep fake\u201d OR \u201cdeepfake\u201d. Please include any slide presentations, memoranda, or notes associated with any of these lesson plans or presentations. Please limit the time frame of this request from July 1, 2023 to the time that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nThis FOI request is being filed in pursuit of a time-sensitive news story. Therefore, I ask that my request is expedited. I'll note that these records may contain personally identifiable information, and I ask that this information is redacted where it appears, as opposed to not including the entire record.\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions about my request, or I can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me at emailcarolinehaskins@gmail.com. I am also happy to hop on the phone.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a reporter, and the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and I look forward to your response within 5 business days, as the statute requires, and hopefully even sooner, if my request is expedited.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline Haskins",

        "communication": "Hi, thanks for your quick response. However, If I may speak honestly, a 2025 response date is completely unreasonable under the circumstances. \r\n\r\n1) This district released 1000+ pages of responsive documents to me and to 404 Media mere weeks after them initial deepfake incident in your district. So, there is a precedent for a reasonable response time to requests that are much wider in scope.\r\n\r\n2) It\u2019s clear from those very documents that the school district did not have any materials planned to educate students about deepfakes through the entirety of the time period pertaining to the request. This limits the period of my request in which there will actually be responsive documents substantially. But I don\u2019t know when, or if, responsive documents may begin to appear in my case.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to believe that this is a case of intentional obfuscation \u2014 perhaps this was a standardized response of sorts. However, I have pro bono legal representation who represents me in FOI disputes, including cases where the response time is unreasonable under the circumstances. I\u2019d prefer to not escalate this to the level of legal proceedings. So, I kindly ask for your district to reassess the time estimate for completing my FOI request, and to provide a breakdown detailing why the request will take that amount of time to complete.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCaroline  \r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Haskins,\r\n\r\nThank you for your email. Please note the District intends to process your request in conjunction with the numerous other public records requests it is currently processing. Your request as written is seeking \u201cany lesson plans, curriculum plans, assembly plans, or presentation plans held by the school district that discuss AI generated fake nude images/deepfakes, or the apps that create these images\u201d as well as \u201cany slide presentations, memoranda, or notes associated with any of these lesson plans or presentations.\u201d Given the broad nature of your request, our search for records will require us to reach out to every teacher and administrator in the District, notify third parties affected by the request, and conduct a comprehensive review for any information that may be exempt from disclosure in accordance with the Washington State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56, et seq.). To allow sufficient time for the District to locate and review potentially responsive records, as well as provide third party notice in instances where the District is contractually required to do so, the District continues to estimate that it will need sixty (60) days, or until October 28, 2024, to prepare an initial production of responsive records. Following the initial production, the District will continue to produce responsive records on an installment basis and at intervals sufficient to allow for the review and third party notification process to occur. If the records are available sooner, we will notify you and if the District needs to update an estimated production date, we will notify you as permitted by RCW 42.56.520.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to narrow or otherwise clarify your request, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nKristen Maginnis\r\nPublic Records Specialist\r\nIssaquah School District\r\n(425) 837-7259\r\nmaginnisk@issaquah.wednet.edu<mailto:maginnisk@issaquah.wednet.edu>\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAFECC.971DD870]<http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/>\r\nThis e-mail contains confidential information intended only for the use of the addressee(s) named above.

FBI, 633 F. Supp. 336 (C.D. Cal. 1986), regarding the limits of Glomar responses.\r\nCiting Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), and Department of Defense v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487 (1994) for the necessity of detailed processing of FOIA requests.\r\nReferencing EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73 (1973), for the importance of substantive review of classified materials.\r\nACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422 (D.C. Cir. 2013), which clarifies the limits of Glomar responses following public acknowledgment.\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nEnclosed is a Fee Waiver Request [attach Fee_Waiver_Letter.pdf], as the information sought is for public knowledge and understanding, and not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nResponse Expectations:\r\nA timely response within the 20-working-day statutory period as outlined in FOIA is expected. In the event of any denial or partial fulfillment, a detailed justification referencing specific FOIA exemptions is required.\r\n\r\nLegal Preparedness:\r\nThis request is structured for use in potential legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the FOIA. Inadequate response or non-compliance may result in legal action.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n\r\nFee_Waiver_Letter.pdf",

L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement. \r\n2.\tSpecifically, I request a database extract including the following variables:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges) including the statute governing the alleged offense \r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n3.\tIf a database extract as described in bullets 1\u20132 is not possible, please provide any existing police reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement. \r\n4.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from the School that were received by your department.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). Moreover, for municipalities with a population of over 20,000, the first two hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record may not be charged a fee. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Kinda, yeah, but not exactly.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting you run the search again but only with that parameter returning larger files, with the intent of seeing how many files are of the kind that might fit the \"1 GB of data can contain anywhere from 16,000 individual pages to over 60,000 pages\" estimate. Using size:1048568..1074000000 returns all the results that are between about a megabyte and a gigabyte. I'm making an educated guess that a very small number of files are responsible for the majority of the on disk space.\r\n\r\nI suspect that some files are very large on disk (like powerpoints with uncompressed images), but have very few pages that need to be reviewed. As an example, a scientist colleague of mine once had a powerpoint presentation that was more than a gigabyte in size, with something like only 50 slides. She'd included some videos that had never been compressed, which drastically inflated the file size.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly what features the city pays for (the licensing agreement with Microsoft is the subject of another ongoing FOIL request of mine!), but one possible option is you may be able to export a report to see more information about the documents the search returns:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-export-a-content-search-report\r\n\r\nAn alternative that I provided was to simply download a copy of the larger search results and spot check them to see if there are just a few files that account for the majority of the on-disk space. That's very easy with some common free software, but if you wish to do it manually, increasing the parameter to something like size:52430000..1074000000 should reduce the volume of files even further.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that using size:1048568..1074000000 might return several hundred files, and size:52430000..1074000000 might return a few dozen. If you run the 50 MB-1GB search and the size of the responsive records are like 10GB, that means we've found the culprit! And I can ask you to either review the number of pages in that files when estimating the voluminousness of the request as a whole. If it's just a few powerpoints, neither of us have to worry about days  spent redacting 16,000 pages, it may only be a hundred.",

        "communication": "Hello there, we are approaching three missed agency-proposed records production dates. Will the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency be met?\r\n\r\nI would like to assume the agency is being forthright with me about meeting a date they propose, and have no knowledge of anything that they might be able to reasonably foresee preventing them from producing the requested and agreed upon records. I struggle to fathom how a pre-existing and ongoing backlog could surprise anybody by causing delays in records production - some agencies have abused this with me in a downright rude manner to delay requests more than a dozen times. \r\n\r\nI have no personal animus with any individual employed by the department - in a likely understaffed role - who is following routine agency procedures, and I presume they have no issue with me. We're all working with unfair systems run by people we have no contact with! Indeed, the records access officer I dealt with earlier was exceptionally helpful and more technically competent than the majority of records access officers that I've interacted with.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have learned that such agency-proposed records production dates are more often missed than met, and it's no more likely the agency will meet the next date they propose than the one they've missed. On muckrock, this agency is a bit better than the average NYC agency, and returns records with an average of 113 days, so we're just on the edge of meeting this date! That's good news - I just want to rely on something better than crossed fingers.\r\n\r\nI am pre-emptively appealing on grounds of constructive denial of records. I am asking the agency to provide guarantees that the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency will be met, and if it cannot be met under current circumstances, that the agency shall either provide a date for which they will provide such records absent circumstances a reasonable person cannot reasonably forsee delaying production of records, or assign sufficient staff to meet the agency proposed records production date. \r\n\r\nI look forward to this appeal being moot upon production of records by the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm. Incident number or other unique identifier for each arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nn. Offender number or other unique identifier for each individual arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until\r\n\r\nthe day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front (NWLF). The NWLF was a radical left-wing terrorist group that formed on or around November 23, 1973, with the bombing of a Pacific Gas and Electric utility substation in Cupertino, California. Over the next six years, the NWLF was credited with bombings throughout the United States; one instance, in 1976, involved members of the organization placing an explosive device on a windowsill at the home of then-San Francisco Supervisor (and later United States Senator) Dianne Feinstein. NWLF membership overlapped with another organization the FBI monitored in this same period: the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). SLA members Bill and Emily Harris claimed membership in the NWLF at the time of their arrests, in 1975.\r\n\r\nThe FBI, at various points during the 1970s, identified the NWLF as a subject of interest in ongoing investigations. Page six of a memorandum located in the FBI's HEARNAP records (dated October 11, 1974; HEARNAP Part 21, page 41) contains what appears to be a Bureau file number for the NWLF at its Los Angeles Field Office: \"LOS ANGELES IS CONDUCTING INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE CASE CAPTIONED 'UNSUB; BOMBING OF SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL, 9750 AIRPORT BOULEVARD, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, OCTOBER 5, 1974' EID - NEW WORLD LIBERATION FRONT, 00: LOS ANGELES, LOS ANGELES FILE 174-2103.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a September 7, 1978 bulletin created by the FBI Terrorism Research Center outlined a detailed history and methodology of the NWLF, stating, in part: \"[I]ncidents, over 70,  have ... occurred in Seattle, Washington; Rainier, Oregon; and Aurora, Colorado. Victims of NWLF attacks have included Federal, state and local governmental functions, diplomatic establishments, corporate facilities, and public utilities. Communiques claiming responsibility for the incidents state the actions were staged to protest against governmental policies and the intervention of the U.S. corporations into the internal affairs of foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nBoth items indicate that the FBI created HQ and field office files for the NWLF in the course of investigations into terrorist attacks carried out by the organization. Therefore, I am requesting copies of all FBI records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front, aka the NWLF.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of investigations into left-wing terrorism. The FBI has already made public records related to the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst in its HEARNAP collection. Contained in these records are numerous references to then NWLF, yet the FBI has not released any records on this group. Contemporaneous and postmortem accounts of the NWLF identify that Ms. Hearst interacted with NWLF members before her capture, thus the release of all NWLF records would contribute significantly to public understanding of the FBI's handling of the HEARNAP case.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the NWLF carried out attacks on public officials and public services for almost a decade. Understanding how the FBI responded to these attacks is a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member\r\n    of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action\r\n    Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print\r\n    and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination\r\n    with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization.\r\n    Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published\r\n    March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other\r\n    nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n    \r\n    A fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested\r\n    information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute\r\n    significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of\r\n    the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the\r\n    requester,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute\r\n    significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of\r\n    government with regard to the FBI's handling of investigations into\r\n    left-wing terrorism. The FBI has already made public records related to the\r\n    kidnapping of Patricia Hearst in its HEARNAP collection. Contained in these\r\n    records are numerous references to then NWLF, yet the FBI has not released\r\n    any records on this group. Contemporaneous and postmortem accounts of the\r\n    NWLF identify that Ms. Hearst interacted with NWLF members before her\r\n    capture, thus the release of all NWLF records would contribute significantly\r\n    to public understanding of the FBI's handling of the HEARNAP case.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

If your FOIPA Number is [1195846-1] please enter [1195846-001] into the system. If you have any questions about the status of your FOIPA request, please e-mail foipaquestions@fbi.gov.\r\n\r\nFIND STATUS OF FOIPA- Request statuses are updated weekly\r\n\r\nPlease enter the whole FOIPA number-Example: [1234567-000]\r\n\r\nFOIPA:\r\nResults will show the Request Number, Case Type and Process Description shown below:\r\nFOIPA:\r\n1234567-000\r\nCase Type:\r\nFOIPA\r\nProcess Description (Will display the current progress of the request)\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOIPA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nYou may be contacted via formal letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Recent requests are entered into the FOIPA database in the order that they are received. Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

In my original request and April 1 clarification, I specified these records be provided electronically. While your April 17 response indicated records were available for physical pickup, I am requesting these communications be provided via email as originally requested.\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any responses to the attached March 4, 2024 email from Paige Locke (sent at 11:48 AM) to Mrs. Tubbs regarding initiating an IEP process for Rowen. This email is of particular interest, and as Rowen's parent under FERPA and given these are also public records, I would appreciate receiving these communications electronically.\r\nIf electronic delivery of all responsive records presents any technical challenges, I would be happy to receive them in batches, starting with the March 2024 communications.\r\nI understand there were system issues due to power outages affecting older records, but the March 2024 communications should not be affected by those winter break outages.\r\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information from me to process this request for electronic delivery.\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "Given your role in the Office of Legal Services, I\u2019m seeking clarification regarding district policy on recommending school-based counseling for a student who, according to official school records, displays no behavioral or academic concerns in school and is described as a role model to her peers.\r\n\r\nAs a parent, I am curious about how such a recommendation aligns with district procedures, particularly in a Title 1 school setting where resources are often allocated based on immediate, school-related needs. Specifically, I\u2019d appreciate insight into:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tDistrict Procedures and Resource Allocation: What is the district\u2019s stance on using Title 1 resources, like school-based counseling, for students who do not display in-school issues? How is this type of intervention typically justified and documented in such cases?\r\n\t2.  Compliance and Liability: Could recommending school-based counseling under these circumstances pose any compliance or liability concerns for the district, particularly if the recommendation is based on observations outside of the school environment?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in clarifying the district\u2019s policy on these matters. I look forward to your guidance on how this aligns with established procedures and legal obligations.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichael Locke\r\n",

While the note reflects the meeting date of March 7, 2024, it does not indicate the date and time when the note was actually created or entered into the school\u2019s record-keeping system.\r\n\r\nI was informed of this meeting only after it had occurred and subsequently spoke with Ms. Tubbs (now Mrs. Woltman) via ClassDojo. In that conversation, I expressed my views on the subjects discussed during the meeting; however, these views were not reflected in the conference note. To ensure complete transparency and accuracy in my child\u2019s educational records, I am requesting the following under FERPA:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInitial Entry Date and Time: Documentation or metadata showing when the March 7, 2024, conference note was first entered or saved in your electronic records system.\r\n\t2.\tAudit Trail: An audit log or record of access, including any modifications, views, or retrievals of this document, along with the associated dates and times. This information will help verify when and by whom the document has been accessed or modified within the school\u2019s system.\r\n\t3.\tExplanation of Record Creation Process: Any policies or procedures relating to how records like conference notes are entered, saved, and generated from your system, specifically addressing any delays between the meeting date and the creation date of the document.\r\n\r\nAs a parent with rights to review and access my child\u2019s educational records under FERPA, I am seeking this information to verify the accuracy and integrity of the documentation in Rowen\u2019s records. I would appreciate a prompt response within the time frame required under FERPA regulations, and I am open to receiving these records in electronic format via email.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees associated with providing these records, please inform me in advance. Should you require further clarification or additional information to process this request, feel free to contact me at the phone number or email address provided above.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

The School Board of Brevard County as a political subdivision of the State of Florida, is required to comply with Florida Statutes in response to its responsibility to comply with requests for public records, particularly, Section 119.07, Florida Statutes, titled Inspection and copying for records; photographing public records: fees: exemptions.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised there are potentially fees to cover the cost of reproduction, including copier expenses, supplies and staff time associated with all requests.  You will be advised as soon as possible regarding estimated costs.  Payment will be due in advance by check or money order made payable to the School Board of Brevard County.

If the actual cost is less than the estimate, a check for reimbursement will be requested and mailed to you.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Not all completed records are in a digitized format.  To receive a digitized version of a redacted record may require additional time and resources, resulting in additional expense.\r\n\r\nYou will be notified if records are exempt from disclosure.  Under public records laws, the district is not obliged to create a new document or records in response to a request for public records.

As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the released files available to the public. I therefore request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link. Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks-simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into small, medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track extra-small requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days, medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the [complex] request [large] processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is [September, 2026].  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

ICE ERO All Significant Event Notifications (SENs) and Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) created by ERO Field Office detention staff or Immigrant ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) staff and transmitted to IHSC\u2019s Medical Quality Management Unit or other custodians responsible for monitoring the quality and timeliness of detained immigrants\u2019s care in custody, between January 1, 2021, and the present, that satisfy all of the following criteria: \r\n(a) Detainee - Involves a detained immigrant in any U.S. ICE facility; \r\n(b) Needing Care \u2014 Who required emergent care, chronic care, or a referral for a higher level of care; \r\n(c) Based on DVT or PE or Clot \u2014 For one or more of the following conditions, whether a formal diagnosis exists or not: (i) deep vein thrombophlebitis (DVT); (ii) pulmonary thromboembelism; _or_ (iii) blood clot. \r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic database entries as printouts in PDF format. \r\n\r\n2. All IHSC or ERO SENs and SIRs relating to medical issues at the Aurora ICE Processing Center just outside Denver, Colorado, created between April 2022 and the present (which, under applicable FOIA law, means \u2018the date on which the agency tasks an adequate search\u2019). \r\n\r\n3. Any record showing the number of chronic care patients, special medical needs, or significant detainee illness patients IHSC Headquarters or the IHSC Regional Health Services Administrator was aware of on the morning of October 12, 2022. We will accept a total number in lieu of a redacted list. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), behalf of the Al Otro Lado #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative and community partners representing individuals detained at Aurora, we respectfully seek expedited processing of this request, and make the following statement under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\nA. On October 14, 2022, ICE announced the death of a 39 year-old man inside Aurora ICE Processing Center. \r\nB. ICE subsequently posted a Detainee Death Report describing his medical treatment and care at Aurora. \r\nC. In the wake of his death, significant questions have arisen as to the safety and appropriateness of the medical services he received in the weeks preceding it. \r\nD. These concerns directly impact humans currently imprisoned inside AIPC, and the medical system serving it. \r\nE. Failure to obtain timely, comprehensive information on IHSC and ICE\u2019s capacity to ensure timely and appropriate medical care may put the health and safety of people inside at further risk. \r\nF. The case has been the subject of widespread media attention, and Congressional demands for preservation of records and a thorough, independent investigation. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we respectfully request expedited processing of this request. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "Andrew Free \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR136823 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2023-ICFO-03979 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 11/14/2022.  You have requested All Significant Event Notifications (SENs) and Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) created by ERO Field Office detention staff or Immigrant ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) staff and transmitted to IHSC\u2019s Medical Quality Management Unit or other custodians responsible for monitoring the quality and timeliness of detained immigrants care in custody, between January 1, 2021, and the present, that satisfy all of the following criteria: (a) Detainee - Involves a detained immigrant in any U.S. ICE facility; (b) Needing Care \u2014 Who required emergent care, chronic care, or a referral for a higher level of care; (c) Based on DVT or PE or Clot \u2014 For one or more of the following conditions, whether a formal diagnosis exists or not: (i) deep vein thrombophlebitis (DVT); (ii) pulmonary thromboembelism; _or_ (iii) blood clot. \r\n\r\n2. All IHSC or ERO SENs and SIRs relating to medical issues at the Aurora ICE Processing Center just outside Denver, Colorado, created between April 2022 and the present (which, under applicable FOIA law, means \u2018the date on which the agency tasks an adequate search\u2019). \r\n\r\n3. Any record showing the number of chronic care patients, special medical needs, or significant detainee illness patients IHSC Headquarters or the IHSC Regional Health Services Administrator was aware of on the morning of October 12, 2022. We will accept a total number in lieu of a redacted list.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request produced 65 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 59 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAngela Flores \r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009 \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\t65 Pages \r\nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.",
