        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Ms. Victoria Lynn Morgan, aka Vicki Morgan, aka Vicky Morgan, aka Vickie Morgan (August 9, 1952 \u2013 July 7, 1983). \r\n\r\nMs. Morgan's name appears multiples times in the Bureau file of magazine publisher Larry Flynt (HQ 62-15369). Instances include:\r\n\r\n1. A Bureau memo dated March 9, 1984, which states that an associate of Mr. Flynt voluntarily appeared before the U.S. Attorney General in Washington D.C. to furnish information about Mr. Flynt. This individual claimed Mr. Flynt was passing around a video tape he purported to be of Ms. Morgan engaged in acts of a sexual nature with government officials. Subsequently, this individual gave a cassette tape to two special agents that contained conversations between another Flynt associate, Gordon Novel, and an unnamed party, in which Mr. Novel alleged that Mr. Flynt was attempting to sell the video tape to the KGB.\r\n\r\n2. Two pages from Mr. Flynt's short-lived newsweekly, The Rebel, which reference Ms. Morgan.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Ms. Morgan was the mistress of businessman Alfred Bloomingdale. According to a May 21, 1984 Time magazine article: \"TIME has learned that Bloomingdale had been investigated by the FBI as early as the late 1960s, when his name came up in connection with organized-crime figures in Las Vegas. About 15 years ago, Bloomingdale shelled out $5,000 in blackmail because of his habit of beating up prostitutes. Yet despite that record, he was chosen by Reagan as an appointee to the sensitive Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in 1981.\"\r\n\r\nConfirmation of this passage can be found here: https://time.com/archive/6860378/a-mistresss-life-and-death/\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reference to a Bureau investigation in the late 1960s, Mr. Bloomingdale, as mentioned, was an unelected political appointee to the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (FSAB). All individuals who served on the FSAB were required to undergo a security background check, conducted by the Bureau, for a top-secret security clearance. This would have required the Bureau to open a file on the individual, if one did not already exist, and generate records in the course of that investigation. It is likely the Bureau would have identified Ms. Morgan and her relationship to Mr. Bloomingdale during this process.\r\n\r\nFinally,  Ms. Morgan was murdered by an associate, Marvin Pancoast, on July 7, 1983. After her murder, attorneys for Mr. Pancoast subpoenaed the Bureau for all records on Ms. Morgan. \r\n\r\nConfirmation of the above statement can be found here: https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/08/Attorneys-for-the-accused-killer-of-Vicki-Morgan-the/3755452836800/\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting all FBI records for Victoria Lynn Morgan, to include all instances mentioned above, those not mentioned, and any records that may have been generated after her death.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Ms. Morgan's privacy, as she passed away in 1983. Although her death was a matter of public record and reported widely in the media, you can find a Washington Post obituary, dated July 7, 1983, here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1983/07/08/vicki-morgan-slain-bloomingdale-mistress-bludgeoned-to-death/a18bb1a6-c14c-4554-a20e-48cbfd8425ac/\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
