Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu.

We have redacted social security numbers, birthdates, personal addresses, telephone numbers, emails, and other personal information.  Pursuant to MCL 15.243 Sec. 13 (1)(a), this information is exempt from disclosure as it is \u201cof a personal nature and disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d All other requested information is enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal the items denied to the City Council in writing.  Such writing must specifically state the word \u201cAPPEAL\u201d and indicate the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial or seek judicial review in the Saginaw County Circuit Court within 180 days of the final determination to deny a request.  If the Council or Court determines a public record is not exempt from disclosure, it shall order its release or production.  If a Court determines that the City has been arbitrary and capricious in not disclosing a public record, it may award in addition to actual, compensatory, and punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total cost associated with responding to your request is $0.00.

The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Unfortunately, the search request was submitted a few weeks ago. It covers June 1, 2021 through October 24, 2022. When we receive a FOIA request, we draft the search terms and parameters for submission to the e-discovery component. They, in turn, run the searches. Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that. But please keep in mind that we process FOIA requests on a first-in, first- out basis.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com> <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request.

The CPRA requires public agencies make reasonably identified, non-exempt public records available for inspection or provide copies upon payment of the direct costs of duplication. \r\nYou requested the following:Dear Custodian of Records: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1.

The FBI has located approximately 1071 pages that are potentially responsive to this request. We are contacting you to see if you might be willing to reduce the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nSimple track requests (up to 50 pages) currently average approximately 115 days (4 months) to complete.\r\nMedium track requests (51-950 pages) currently average approximately 653 days (21 months) to complete.\r\nLarge track requests (951-8000 pages) currently average 1,432 days (47 months) to complete.\r\nExtra-large requests (over 8000 pages) currently average 2,008 days (53 months) to complete.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  \r\n\r\nIf so, might we suggest you consider narrowing this request to the subject's permanent brief, which is a synopsis of his entire career and includes summaries of his performance evaluations, his commendations, censures, and salary history. Narrowing to this document alone would bring the request down to 25 pages, well within the simple track. We could work with you on other parameters to narrow the request as well.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached by email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or by phone at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-1695",

I hereby request the following records:\n\nDocumentation describing the email system(s) used by your agency, including the procedures and methods for performing searches of the email system.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Dear KellyKauffman,\r\n\r\n\"On January 24, 2024, the USGS Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office received your FOIA request, dated January 23, 2024, and assigned it control number DOI-USGS-2024-000061. Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.      Documents, memos, presentations, or other materials regarding Kauffman Glacier, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.      Documents, memos, presentations, or other materials regarding Thomas A. Kauffman, U.S. Antarctic Research Program (USARP) biologist and Station Scientific Leader at Palmer Station in 1973. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as an \u201cother use\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to two hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have not stated your willingness to pay FOIA processing fees.  The FOIA requires that you explicitly state your willingness to pay all FOIA processing fees associated with processing your request, that you will pay fees up to a specified amount, and/or that you are seeking a fee waiver.  Therefore, we cannot fully comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the written assurance that you are willing to pay all FOIA processing fees or that you are willing to pay FOIA processing fees up to a certain amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to our regulations, if we do not receive your written assurance to pay all FOIA processing fees or FOIA processing fees up to a certain amount within 20 workdays from the date of this communication, no later than February 26, 2024, we will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request.  In such a circumstance, we will not be able to comply with your request and will close our file on it.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.5(d).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may appeal this response to the Department of the Interior\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer.  If you choose to appeal, the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer must receive your FOIA appeal no later than 90 workdays from the date of this letter.  Appeals arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, will be deemed received on the next workday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour appeal must be made in writing.  You may submit your appeal and accompanying materials to the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer by mail, courier service, fax, or email.  All communications concerning your appeal should be clearly marked with the words: \"FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.\"  You must include an explanation of why you believe the USGS\u2019s response is in error.  You must also include with your appeal copies of all correspondence between you and USGS concerning your FOIA request, including your original FOIA request and USGS's response.  Failure to include with your appeal all correspondence between you and USGS will result in the Department's rejection of your appeal, unless the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer determines (in the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer\u2019s sole discretion) that good cause exists to accept the defective appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease include your name and daytime telephone number (or the name and telephone number of an appropriate contact), email address and fax number (if available) in case the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer needs additional information or clarification of your appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOI FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Office Contact Information\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Interior\r\n\r\nOffice of the Solicitor\r\n\r\n1849 C Street, Northwest\r\n\r\nMS-6556 MIB\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20240\r\n\r\nAttn: FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Office\r\n\r\nTelephone:      (202) 208-5339\r\n\r\nFax:                 (202) 208-6677\r\n\r\nEmail:             FOIA.Appeals@sol.doi.gov\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Seven months of repeated delays are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request. Considering similar requests I've had fulfilled by SCOC, I anticipate this one to result in well under 100 pages of mostly boilerplate releasable records.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, SCOC is required by law to, within 10 business days, provide specific reasons why this request cannot be fulfilled, or else must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by \r\nthe specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is  unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied. In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with Public Officers Law \u00a789.4(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing  such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the  person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who  shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

I ran a preliminary search of ALJ Westby's mailbox with your criteria and the search has resulted in 10,808 emails. These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJeane Duane Kirkpatrick (November 19, 1926 \u2013 December 7, 2006) was an American diplomat and political scientist. An ardent anticommunist, she was a longtime Democrat who became a Republican in 1985. After serving as Ronald Reagan's foreign policy adviser in his 1980 campaign, she became the first woman to serve as US Ambassador to the United Nations. She was known for the \"Kirkpatrick Doctrine\", which advocated supporting authoritarian regimes around the world if they went along with Washington's aims. She believed that they could be led into democracy by example. She wrote, \"Traditional authoritarian governments are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.\" Kirkpatrick served on Reagan's Cabinet on the National Security Council, Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Defense Policy Review Board, and chaired the Secretary of Defense Commission on Fail Safe and Risk reduction of the Nuclear Command and Control System. \r\n\r\nHer death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/washington/09kirkpatrick.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names and companies.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the Bureau for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\nFebruary 16, 2024 Miriam Bhimani 156466-73719040@requests.muckrock.com RE: Chicago Public Schools FOIA Request N014772-020124 \r\nDear Ms. Bhimani: This letter is in reply to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking the following information: Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nProvide records sufficient to show from January 01, 2024 to January 31, 2024: \r\n\r\n1. The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Part three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 Additionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, records have been redacted in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

(https://www.dw.com/en/us-backed-sdf-captures-syrias-largest-oil-field-from-islamic-state/a-41066879)\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 2020, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Levant Affairs and Special Envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn confirmed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that a company called Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been a given a license from the Office of Foreign Asset Control to work with oil fields under SDF control. Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn stated that the State Department had issued \"foreign policy guidance\" in support of Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's application, stating that U.S. officials \"support trying to get the economy of northeast Syria up and running to the extent it can under the present conditions of war.\" (https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2020/12/09/trump-administration-helped-gop-donors-get-syria-oil-deal/)\r\n\r\nDelta Crescent Energy, LLC was granted a license in April 2020, per documents released by the Office of Foreign Asset Control to investigative journalist Zack Kopplin on December 9. Three other companies had applied for a license from the Office and were rejected, according to an earlier report by Kopplin. (https://newrepublic.com/article/158841/pompeo-trump-steal-oil-kurds-syria-iraq)\r\n\r\nI am seeking expedited processing of my request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity in a matter of current exigency to the American public..\r\n\r\nIn response to Rayburn's remarks during the December 9 hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn admitted that the State Department had not discussed an oil for any other company. Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas noted in response that Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been co-founded by a prominent donor to Republican Party causes. \"We are just leaving what has been a dark period of corruption and graft, sometimes fraud, that has been looked the other way, sometimes, I would argue, encouraged by the Trump administration,\" Castro said.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the public has an urgent need to know as much as possible about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's relationship with the U.S. Government and with U.S. Government activities in Syria, especially as U.S. troops are risking life and limb to safeguard Syrian oil fields.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump had stated in October and November 2019 that U.S. military forces are remain in Syria \"only for the oil\" and that they \"may have to fight for the oil.\" At least two U.S. service members have died in Syria since he made these statements, and at least four were injured in an August 2020 skirmish with Russian forces (https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/us-troops-injured-russian-forces-syria-402347).\r\n\r\nForeign countries have condemned the U.S. presence on Syrian oil fields, increasing the risk to Americans stationed there. The Turkish foreign ministry called any U.S. move to extract Syrian oil \"utterly unacceptable\" (https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-slams-us-over-oil-deal-with-ypg-in-syria-157090), while the Syrian government denounced the rumored deal as \"an assault against Syria\u2019s sovereignty\" and \"a continuation of the U.S. hostile approach towards Syria\" (http://www.sana.sy/en/?p=198923).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, federal courts have recognized the public's interest in breaking news, which \"conveys information the public wants quickly,\u201d \u201cwould lose value if it were delayed\" (Am. Civil Liberties Union of N. Cal., 2006 WL 1469418 at *6.), and may have an \"impact\" on the public's political decision-making (Id. at *7).\r\n\r\nSyria policy certainly could impact the public's political decision-making process. The Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria in October 2019 caused several congressional hearings and an high volume of news coverage. The public would undoubtedly have an interest in understanding further developments in U.S. policy in the same region of Syria, especially as the transition to a new presidential administration approaches in January 2021.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay up to $100 in fees, but I also believe that I qualify for a fee waiver as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has been published in the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Petti\n\n",

You have requested access to the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201cDepartment of Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Control FOIA Office Department of the Treasury Washington, DC 20220 December 14, 2020 To Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: Any foreign policy guidance issued by the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control regarding applications to work with Syrian oil filed between October 2017 and December 2020.\u201d (Date Range for Record Search: From 10/1/2017 To 12/16/2020)\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

(https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://www.dw.com/en/us-backed-sdf-captures-syrias-largest-oil-field-from-islamic-state/a-41066879)\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 2020, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Levant Affairs and Special Envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn confirmed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that a company called Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been a given a license from the Office of Foreign Asset Control to work with oil fields under SDF control. Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn stated that the State Department had issued \"foreign policy guidance\" in support of Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's application, stating that U.S. officials \"support trying to get the economy of northeast Syria up and running to the extent it can under the present conditions of war.\" (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2020/12/09/trump-administration-helped-gop-donors-get-syria-oil-deal/)\r\n\r\nDelta Crescent Energy, LLC was granted a license in April 2020, per documents released by the Office of Foreign Asset Control to investigative journalist Zack Kopplin on December 9. Three other companies had applied for a license from the Office and were rejected, according to an earlier report by Kopplin. (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://newrepublic.com/article/158841/pompeo-trump-steal-oil-kurds-syria-iraq)\r\n\r\nI am seeking expedited processing of my request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity in a matter of current exigency to the American public..\r\n\r\nIn response to Rayburn's remarks during the December 9 hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn admitted that the State Department had not discussed an oil for any other company. Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas noted in response that Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been co-founded by a prominent donor to Republican Party causes. \"We are just leaving what has been a dark period of corruption and graft, sometimes fraud, that has been looked the other way, sometimes, I would argue, encouraged by the Trump administration,\" Castro said.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the public has an urgent need to know as much as possible about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's relationship with the U.S. Government and with U.S. Government activities in Syria, especially as U.S. troops are risking life and limb to safeguard Syrian oil fields.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump had stated in October and November 2019 that U.S. military forces are remain in Syria \"only for the oil\" and that they \"may have to fight for the oil.\" At least two U.S. service members have died in Syria since he made these statements, and at least four were injured in an August 2020 skirmish with Russian forces (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/us-troops-injured-russian-forces-syria-402347\r\n\r\nForeign countries have condemned the U.S. presence on Syrian oil fields, increasing the risk to Americans stationed there. The Turkish foreign ministry called any U.S. move to extract Syrian oil \"utterly unacceptable\" (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-slams-us-over-oil-deal-with-ypg-in-syria-157090), while the Syrian government denounced the rumored deal as \"an assault against Syria\u2019s sovereignty\" and \"a continuation of the U.S. hostile approach towards Syria\" (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=http://www.sana.sy/en/?p=198923).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, federal courts have recognized the public's interest in breaking news, which \"conveys information the public wants quickly,\u201d \u201cwould lose value if it were delayed\" (Am. Civil Liberties Union of N. Cal., 2006 WL 1469418 at *6.), and may have an \"impact\" on the public's political decision-making (Id. at *7).\r\n\r\nSyria policy certainly could impact the public's political decision-making process. The Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria in October 2019 caused several congressional hearings and an high volume of news coverage. The public would undoubtedly have an interest in understanding further developments in U.S. policy in the same region of Syria, especially as the transition to a new presidential administration approaches in January 2021.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay up to $100 in fees, but I also believe that I qualify for a fee waiver as a media requester.

For similar responsive records on Use of Force data from January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021, please visit request number #21-9649.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per your communication on February 13, 2022, below is our previous communication from February 1, 2022:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Use of force (UOF) data dating from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. This data should include the case number, incident date, incident time, suspect injured indicator, suspect injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), suspect age, suspect gender, suspect ethnicity, suspect weapon type, incident area occurred, whether the officer was injured, force type, and most importantly, badge number associated with the officers involved.\r\n\r\n2. All police shifts for each employee (identified by badge number) from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. This should include the time of start and end for each shift, the date of the shift, and the corresponding badge number of the employee.\r\n\r\n3. Employee demographics for all employees employed from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. All badge numbers linked to the corresponding race, gender, and age if available.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #1 of your request, the records you are seeking have been previously provided in another request (see:\u00a0https://lacity.nextrequest.com/requests/21-9649) for Use of Force data for time period January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the following fields are what has been provided: incident date, incident time, area occurred, case number, suspect ethnicity, suspect age, suspect gender, suspect injuries force related (yes or no), suspect injury type description, suspect weapon type description, employee ethnicity, employee injuries force related (yes or no), employee injury description, incident area occurred, employee unit description, force type description, and finding type.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department did not provide Officer badge numbers as they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Sections 6254(c) and (k) of the Act. Section 6254(c) exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0Section 6254(k), exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Penal Code.\u00a0Penal Code Section 832.7 states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code.\u00a0[See Penal Code Sections 832.5 and 832.7 and Evidence Code Sections 1043 and 1045]. California case law holds that Evidence Code Section 1043\u00a0et seq.\u00a0is the exclusive means to obtain peace officer personnel records, and as such, they are exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Act.\u00a0[See\u00a0City of Hemet v. Superior Court\u00a0(1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th\u00a01411].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, for the sake of transparency the employee\u2019s ethnicity and unit description have been provided.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to Use of Force data for the time period of October 28, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and #3 of your request, please be advised that, pursuant to California Government Code Section 6253(c), we are still searching for, collecting, and/or reviewing the requested records. Should any records be located we will require time to review the requested records for confidential portions that are exempt from disclosure under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255. We will provide you with a response upon completion of our review. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #2 of your request, please note that in order for the Department to provide the requested data, the Department would have to take affirmative steps to locate all potentially responsive documents, related to sworn personnel, and then manually review and extract the specific information that is being sought. Due to the amount of time it would take to do so and based on the same need to retain confidentiality of certain information, the request is unduly burdensome as interpreted by the courts under the \"public interest\" provision of Government Code Section 6255 of the California Public Records Act. Similarly, the Department asserts the exemption due to our belief that disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to endanger the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public. Therefore, we are denying this portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMeghan Leong",
