        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The five most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee concerning immigration matters. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",
