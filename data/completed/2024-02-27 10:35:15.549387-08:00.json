Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

I hereby request the following records:\n\nDocumentation describing the email system(s) used by your agency, including the procedures and methods for performing searches of the email system.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Best",

Dear Peter Fugiel, On behalf of the Office of the Mayor, I am responding to your Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request which was dated April 30, 2023 and received in our office on the same day. At this time, the Office of the Mayor\u00a0is seeking an extension of five additional working days to respond to the requests for one or more of the following reasons identified in 5 ILCS 140/3(e) of FOIA: (xx) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records; (\u00a0 ) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; (\u00a0 ) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it; (\u00a0 ) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; (xx) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of the FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions; (\u00a0 ) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by 5 ILCS 140/3(d) without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body; (xx) there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request.

Dear Peter Fugiel, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on April 30, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on May 8, 2023. You requested: \"To whom it may concern, \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Rahm Emanuel or Lori Lightfoot during the period 1/1/2017\u201312/31/2021 that contain any of the following phrases: \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\" or \"fair scheduling\". \r\n\r\nThis request is being made for non-commercial research purposes. The requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer that the request be filled electronically, if possible, by email attachment. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel \r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow \r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmayors-office-885%252Fchicago-mayors-fair-workweek-emails-145180%252F%253Femail%253DMOfoia%252540cityofchicago.org&url_auth_token=AAAVakss4kqDBu4naYY4htHES6U%3A1ptIlR%3ATu306bisa7gmrkt41yCqXQQf8HKkbjhmFBhjx7X58-g\" \r\nYour request is unduly burdensome under Section 3(g) of FOIA.\u00a0 Section 3(g) of FOIA provides that \u201crequests for all records falling within a category shall be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information.\u201d \r\n\r\nI ran the email search you requested, but it returned\u00a0573 responsive emails and attachments totaling\u00a04,334 pages of responsive records.\u00a0 Assuming it would take between 1/2 to 1 minute on average to review each page of responsive records, it would take between 36 and 72 hours to review the records responsive to this request.\u00a0 While there is some public interest in some of the information requested, the request places a high burden on the Mayor's Office's time and operations.\u00a0 Overall, the burden on the Mayor's Office outweighs the public interest in the information, and the request is unduly burdensome under Section 3(g) of FOIA. \r\n\r\nIt is necessary that your FOIA request be narrowed and clarified.\u00a0 If you would like assistance in narrowing your request, please contact me, and I will assist you.\u00a0 Otherwise, for the reasons provided above, the Mayor's Office is unable to respond to your FOIA request as currently drafted. \r\n\r\nIf you agree to narrow your request, you must submit a revised written request to my attention. The Mayor's Office will take no further action or send you any further correspondence unless and until your current request is narrowed in writing.\u00a0 If we do not receive your narrowed request within fourteen calendar days of the date of this letter, your current request will be denied. \r\n\r\nIn the event that we do not receive a narrowed request and your current FOIA request is therefore denied, you have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62706, (877) 299-3642. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844. Sincerely, Thomas Skelton \r\nFOIA Officer \r\nMayor's Office",

I recognize the need to balance the burden of fulfilling the request and the public interest in the information. While the latter side of the ledger is difficult to estimate as precisely as you have the former, I would note that the Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance represents the most expansive labor standard of its kind. Along with a handful of other cities and one state, Chicago has established the most significant new rights and protections on working time since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. My research seeks to understand the development and implementation of fair workweek laws, a project in which the National Science Foundation found sufficient merit to award me a competitive research fellowship (#2203815).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable public interest in this information, I am willing to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciate your continued assistance and look forward to your response to this narrowed request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management & Labor Relations",

I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\" \nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \n\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \n\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is personal email addresses and personal phone numbers.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \nWe have redacted under Section 7(1)(c) City issued cell phone numbers.\u00a0 As publicly-available City issued cell phone numbers would subject these employees to invasive and unsolicited communications, the disclosure of this information would burden employees\u2019 privacy interest. Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v. U.S. Department of the Navy, Case No. 14-cv-2115-BEN, 2016 WL 4801335 at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2016) (affirming the redaction of an employee\u2019s cell phone number, because \u201cthe [employee\u2019s] privacy rights in this information outweigh the public\u2019s interest in disclosure\u201d).\u201d \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that the deliberative process exemption under FOIA focuses on documents that reflect \u201cadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d NLRB v. Sears and Roebuck, 421 U.S. 132, 150-151 (1975).\u00a0 The purpose is to encourage \u201cfrank discussion of legal or policy matters\u201d such that employees in government feel free to express their opinions before a final legal or policy decision is made. \u201cDeliberative\u201d has been found to mean being a direct part of the process where recommendations and opinions are expressed. Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-44 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Records where preliminary opinions are expressed and policies and actions are formulated are therefore exempt from production under Section 7(1)(f) of the Illinois FOIA, and have been properly redacted and withheld. \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(m) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nCommunications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m).\u00a0 Because the redacted and withheld records constituted privileged communications between an attorney and clients, they have been properly redacted and withheld under this section. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844. Sincerely, Thomas Skelton \nFOIA Officer \nMayor's Office",

I have a couple of clarifying questions to be sure that these are the entirely of the records responsive to my request. \r\n\r\nFirst, would you confirm that only one email (with the subject \"Students Demand Action & Wisconsin Preemption - The DMO Digest\") was sent or received by Mayor Emanuel during the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019? For context, the Committee on Workforce Development and Audit, then chaired by Mayor Emanuel's floor leader Patrick O'Connor, held multiple meetings on the proposed Fair Workweek Ordinance in April 2018. Am I to understand that your search return no emails updating Mayor Emanuel of the status of this proposal in the final months of his term in office?\r\n\r\nSecond, could you clarify why certain email attachments (\"Fair Workweek City Comparison 7.20.docx\" and \"BRIEF_0726_Osterman briefing.docx\") were not included in the records provided? It is not clear to me that a document comparing provisions of existing fair workweek laws meets any of the statutory requirements for exemption. The laws are public, so why would a document quoting/summarizing them be withheld? Similarly, I don't understand why a briefing document mentioning fair workweek would not be subject to disclosure now that the law has been enacted and Alderman Osterman and Mayor Lightfoot have left office.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any clarification or additional records you can provide at this time. Given the considerable public interest in the Mayors' leadership around this major piece of policy, I may need to submit additional requests if this one is too narrow to yield relevant records, e.g. from the Emanuel administration.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued attention to this matter,\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJoseph Steinbach\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoseph Steinbach",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

The agency\u2019s FOIA backlog \u2014 a longstanding, widely acknowledge concern for Congress \u2014 will be reduced by affirmative identification of frequently requested records. The agency will get fewer requests by making more of the frequently requested materials more easily accessible. Agency FOIA reviewers will not have to reinvent the wheel in processing redactions and determine which exemptions apply. And the public will get more complete and timely access to information because the agency will have posted it.\r\n\r\nThis is not an aspirational goal; it is the law. \r\n\r\n5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) requires agencies to post records that have been requested 3 or more times. The \u201cBeetlejuice Provision\u201d, if you will. \r\n\r\nOur review of your agency\u2019s public FOIA reading room, and a comparison of the publicly available FOIA logs your agency publishes, reveals that a number of thrice-requested materials appear to be missing. Consequently, we file this request to understand the process by which your agency determines what to include under the Beetlejuice Provision.\r\n\r\n1. Please provide all calendar entries, meeting minutes, attendee lists, working papers (or similar documents), slide decks or presentations, and follow-up calendar items for any meeting your agency\u2019s FOIA Officer or designee held to consider the agency\u2019s affirmative releases and proactive disclosures under the Beetlejuice Provision.\r\n\r\n2. Please provide any record reflecting your agency\u2019s FOIA Officers\u2019 identification of a record that may be eligible for release based upon the Beetlejuice Provision because it has been requested three times under paragraph 3. If the records requested are kept in an electronic system of records, like eFOIAExpress, we would accept a printout of requests designated as potential subject to proactive release under the Beetlejuice Provision in lieu of records responsive to this Item. \r\n\r\n3. Any guidance your agency issued for FOIA professionals regarding identification of requests that are potentially subject to proactive release under the Beetlejuice Provision.\r\n\r\nPlease task a search period beginning on January 1, 2022, and ending May 18, 2022. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

DCYF will also be working closely with the Department of Health which provides oversight for the behavioral and substance treatment centers to provide them with information about CPS investigations at these locations.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about reporting suspected child abuse or neglect, visit https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/safety/report-abuse.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

That support level would increase based on additional needs of the child, including support for adolescents, chronic physical health, developmental disabilities, and mental health.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Caregiver Support Rates chart [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2023/12/28/file_attachments/2731309/Caregiver%20Supports%20Rates.pdf ] \r\n\r\n\"We know that caregivers who have children and youth with higher needs, need more support to care for them,\" said DCYF Secretary Ross Hunter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, DCYF is changing its rate assessment process. DCYF will begin to use the child\u2019s case file, information gathered from the child, parents, family, and other important individuals in the child\u2019s life, and health history information to determine support level.\r\n\r\nIf a caregiver believes information about the child's needs was not considered in a level determination, they have the opportunity to appeal. Caregivers can request rate determination review any time there is a change in circumstances or a new diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\"The new process will help us identify\u00a0a child\u2019s needs and help us link caregivers to the supports that are best suited for the child in their care,\" explained Hunter. \"By better preparing\u00a0caregivers to support children and youth placed in their care, we should see an increase in placement stability.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\nDCYF has removed barriers for kinship caregivers to become licensed to care for the children in their home. If they have an approved home study, kin most likely already meet the requirements for a kinship license. Once licensed, the children in their care are eligible to receive monthly foster care maintenance payments to assist in meeting their needs.\r\n\r\nLastly, caregivers licensed by child placing agencies will begin to be paid directly by DCYF.\u00a0The new caregiver supports model marks the first time the rates and process have undergone major changes in over two decades.\u00a0The change is part of a larger project aimed at implementing a continuum of placement resources that enable safe, stable, and supported placements for children in the care of DCYF.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo learn more about DCYF's Caregiver Supports project, visit:\u00a0*https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project* [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project ].\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

It is likewise a serious barrier to reunifying children with their parents,\" Washington State Court Administrator Dawn Marie Rubio said at the signing ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Office of the Courts played a critical role to bring all three branches of government together to come to this agreement.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOver the years, there has been a lack of capacity in parts of the state, but through this partnership, DCYF and public housing authority and non-profits will now be able to serve more youth and families with housing statewide. Eligible families and youth will receive referrals from their DCYF caseworker to a contracted provider who will help them locate housing that accepts vouchers.\r\n\r\nMichael Mirra, retired executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority and co-chair of the Housing and Child Welfare Subcommittee, said the agreement will imbed housing into the child welfare system. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will spare children and families from the trauma of avoidable out-of-home placement, it will house teenagers coming from foster care or juvenile rehabilitation who would otherwise start their independent adulthood by becoming homeless, it will help the state\u2019s child welfare workers perform what may be the hardest job in public service; and it will save the state money in averted foster care costs,\u201d he explained.\r\n\r\nLowel Krueger, executive director of the Yakima Housing Authority said folks from the Association of Washington Housing Authorities were grateful for all of the partners who \"persisted in establishing this innovative collaboration to provide families involved in the child welfare system with housing, a critical first step in helping families and changing life outcomes for children.\"\r\n\r\nDCYF\u2019s ability to begin to provide the contracted Housing Supportive Services that are necessary to fulfill its commitment to HUD was made possible through $8 million in investments from the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited to sign this historic document with all the partnerships and what it means for the families we serve,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cWhen our youth and families are supported, they thrive, preventing deeper penetration into the child welfare system.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter with folks from the Housing Authorities photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787090/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20with%20folks%20from%20the%20Housing%20Authorities.jpg ]\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter Signing MOU photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787091/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20Signing%20MOU.jpg ]\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:*\r\n\r\nNancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnder the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, \u00a72.2-3704 et seq. I request the following public records:\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest separated by school, and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.

Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. If you claim such an exemption to my request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, please cite in writing the specific statutory exemption. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format (such as excel file (.xlsx) or other database form, or as .pdfs) and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Hannah Beckler.",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n4. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5. The cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and,\r\n\r\n6. The total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7. The total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and,\r\n\r\n8. A description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

After careful review, your request has been granted in part, denied in part.  We have redacted social security numbers, birthdates, personal addresses, telephone numbers, emails, and other personal information.  Pursuant to MCL 15.243 Sec. 13 (1)(a), this information is exempt from disclosure as it is \u201cof a personal nature and disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d All other requested information is enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal the items denied to the City Council in writing.  Such writing must specifically state the word \u201cAPPEAL\u201d and indicate the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial or seek judicial review in the Saginaw County Circuit Court within 180 days of the final determination to deny a request.  If the Council or Court determines a public record is not exempt from disclosure, it shall order its release or production.  If a Court determines that the City has been arbitrary and capricious in not disclosing a public record, it may award in addition to actual, compensatory, and punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total cost associated with responding to your request is $0.00.  You may find a copy of the City's FOIA policy and public summary on the City of Saginaw website at\r\nhttps://cms5.revize.com/revize/cityofsaginawmi/Documents%20Center/Government/City%20Manager/Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act/FOIA-Policy-Appendix.pdf<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fcms5.revize.com%2frevize%2fcityofsaginawmi%2fDocuments%2520Center%2fGovernment%2fCity%2520Manager%2fFreedom%2520of%2520Information%2520Act%2fFOIA-Policy-Appendix.pdf&c=E,1,S-Z6iIVgvjdI-LSUZPi4IQrxiHHjkRiAhnWGllp-BSxWfpy-_gyv_T-B7cjzqXx4UxT4X-MAPDvUyYdlK3Wgw1BXjk5-Rf0I9N3rx91Pt5XL&typo=1>.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (989) 759-1403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVicki L.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013).

Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request.

Your request sought to access to the following records:\u00a0\u201c Dear Custodian of Records:\u201d \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023. \r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023. \r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed.

The agency acknowledged receiving this request on May 23, 2023, and produced records on February 8, 2024. \r\n\r\nPlease produce at minimum, \r\n\r\n(1) the FOIA tasker CBP FOIA created assigning this request, \r\n(2) the Daily Media Summary CBP FOIA created including this request, and \r\n(3) the processing form any custodians created indicated systems of records searched, time spent searching, search terms, the date the search was tasked, and the time period searched. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. The records CBP FOIA released on February 8, 2024, encompass 44 individual deaths over a 9-month period (rather than the 99.5-month period we sought). \r\n2. The records set contains least 8 in-custody CBP deaths for which no prior record of public release by CBP appears to exist, in contravention of the agency's Death Notifications policy. \r\n3. The records set omits several publicly reported in-custody CBP deaths during the 9-month the records encompass, apparently putting CBP in violation of its obligations under DCRA. \r\n4. The General Accountability Office has repeatedly concluded CBP needed to improve its death reporting mechanisms. \r\n5. In-custody CBP deaths and federal law enforcement agencies' noncompliance with DCRA have been subject of widespread media criticism, with repeat findings of the noncompliance. \r\n6. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately [ 0 ] pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-057084 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \r\nSincerely, \r\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Unfortunately, the search request was submitted a few weeks ago. It covers June 1, 2021 through October 24, 2022. When we receive a FOIA request, we draft the search terms and parameters for submission to the e-discovery component. They, in turn, run the searches. Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that. But please keep in mind that we process FOIA requests on a first-in, first- out basis.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com> <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Specifically, I am requesting the following documents:All versions of the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including but not limited to Executive Order 13769 and any subsequent versions or ordersAny correspondence, memoranda, or other documents related to the development, implementation, or enforcement of the executive order, including communications between the White House and other agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Homeland SecurityAny internal reports or assessments conducted by the government on the impact of the executive order on individuals, families, and communities affected by the travel banAny records related to the waiver process for individuals seeking an exemption from the travel banAny other documents, including emails, letters, and reports, that pertain to the executive order restricting travel from Muslim-majority countriesThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes..  Your request was received in this office on 3/5/2023.  After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-HQFO-01118.  Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.  The status of your FOIA request is now available online and can be accessed at: https://foiarequest.dhs.gov/app/CheckStatus.aspx, by using this FOIA request number.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the determination regarding my FOIA request, dated March 5, 2023, to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I submitted a request for documents related to the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries in 2017, including Executive Order 13769 and any subsequent versions or orders. My request was acknowledged by your office in a letter dated April 21, 2023, which asserted that my request was too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records sought.\r\n\r\nAs advised in the April 21, 2023, letter, I am providing more specific details to enable government employees familiar with the subject area to locate the requested records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.\r\n\r\nAll signed versions of the executive order restricting travel from Muslim-majority countries, including Executive Order 13769, Executive Order 13780, and any subsequent or related orders.\r\nCorrespondence, memoranda, or other documents related to the development, implementation, or enforcement of the executive order, including communications between the White House and other agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State (DOS), and DHS. Limit the search to the dates between January 20, 2017, and December 31, 2018.\r\nInternal reports or assessments conducted by the government on the impact of the executive order on individuals, families, and communities affected by the travel ban. Limit the search to the dates between January 20, 2017, and December 31, 2018.\r\nRecords related to the waiver process for individuals seeking an exemption from the travel ban, including policy guidance, criteria, and statistics on the number of waivers granted and denied. Limit the search to the dates between January 20, 2017, and December 31, 2018.\r\nIn the interest of narrowing the scope of my request, I am no longer seeking any other documents, including emails, letters, and reports that pertain to the executive order.\r\n\r\nRegarding the burden of proof, it is the agency's responsibility to conduct an adequate search for records as specified under FOIA. In the case Weisberg v. U.S. Department of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the court established that the FOIA requires the agency to show, using \"reasonably detailed affidavits\" and \"a reasonable description of the records\" that they have conducted a thorough search for the requested records.\r\n\r\nBased on the revised scope of my request, I trust that DHS will be able to conduct a more targeted search for the requested records. Please consider this appeal and provide the requested information as promptly as possible. If you have any questions or need clarification please feel free to reach out.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter ",

You requested copies of any and all records related to the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries in 2017. Specifically, you am requesting the following documents: \n\nAll versions of the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including but not limited to Executive Order 13769 and any subsequent versions or orders \nAny correspondence, memoranda, or other documents related to the development, implementation, or enforcement of the executive order, including communications between the White House and other agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Homeland Security \nAny internal reports or assessments conducted by the government on the impact of the executive order on individuals, families, and communities affected by the travel ban \nAny records related to the waiver process for individuals seeking an exemption from the travel ban \nAny other documents, including emails, letters, and reports, that pertain to the executive order restricting travel from Muslim-majority countries \n\nThis office received your request on 3/5/2023. \n\nInformation responsive to your request can be accessed online at \nExecutive Orders 13769 and 13780 | Homeland Security (dhs.gov) (https://www.dhs.gov/publication/executive-orders-13769-and-13780) \n\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), DHS need not make available under FOIA records that are publicly available. \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below who processed your request and refer to 2023-HQFO-01118.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The CPRA requires public agencies make reasonably identified, non-exempt public records available for inspection or provide copies upon payment of the direct costs of duplication. \r\nYou requested the following:Dear Custodian of Records: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1.

Gov. Code \u00a7 6253(c).)\u00a0 This letter satisfies the City\u2019s requirement to respond to you within ten (10) days to notify you whether the records will be disclosed (Gov. Code \u00a7 6253(c).) \r\nPursuant to Government Code Section 6253(c), the Livermore Police Department requires a 14 day extension of time to respond due to: \r\n\r\nThe need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having substantial interest in the determination of the request or  among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter \r\nAccordingly, the Livermore Police Department will formally respond to your request no later than February 28, 2024. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me. \r\nSincerely, \r\nCarolyn Pettigrew \r\nRecords Clerk \r\nPolice Department \r\n925-371-4900",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of February 04, 2024, Reference # P000336-020424. \r\nDear Jennifer Pinsof, \r\n\r\nThe Livermore Police Department received the following request from you on February 04, 2024. \r\nYou requested the following: Dear Custodian of Records: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023. \r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023. \r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJennifer Pinsof \r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/jpinsof/131963/table.pdf \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Flivermore-police-department-12041%252Fsb34-alpr-data-sharing-livermore-police-department-158027%252F%253Femail%253DJMichelson%252540cityoflivermore.net&url_auth_token=AABABtIwJF7XBBA6GCoJnzqX4X8%3A1rWq8l%3A2jlWp4Yr640Zrx7D5J4z4aGdqfRpkebEpgKg8I14H2U \r\nResponsive records are available on the Records Request Portal. Select the link below to view your request. Police Public Records Request - P000336-020424 \r\nFor A1-A4: I have attached the Vigilant report.\u00a0 For Flock, there is not a report in the system that I can generate to provide this information. \r\nFor B1-B4: I have attached the Vigilant report for detections/hits for 2023 and 2024(up to today).\u00a0 For Flock, they only have detections/hits for the past 30 days.\u00a0 I have attached those reports. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact me at 925-371-4900. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCarolyn Pettigrew \r\nRecords Clerk \r\nPolice Department \r\n925-371-4900",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nAnother of your requests has come for possible negotiation. The FBI has located approximately 1071 pages that are potentially responsive to this request. We are contacting you to see if you might be willing to reduce the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nSimple track requests (up to 50 pages) currently average approximately 115 days (4 months) to complete.\r\nMedium track requests (51-950 pages) currently average approximately 653 days (21 months) to complete.\r\nLarge track requests (951-8000 pages) currently average 1,432 days (47 months) to complete.\r\nExtra-large requests (over 8000 pages) currently average 2,008 days (53 months) to complete.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  \r\n\r\nIf so, might we suggest you consider narrowing this request to the subject's permanent brief, which is a synopsis of his entire career and includes summaries of his performance evaluations, his commendations, censures, and salary history. Narrowing to this document alone would bring the request down to 25 pages, well within the simple track. We could work with you on other parameters to narrow the request as well.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached by email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or by phone at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-1695",

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.      Documents, memos, presentations, or other materials regarding Kauffman Glacier, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.      Documents, memos, presentations, or other materials regarding Thomas A. Kauffman, U.S. Antarctic Research Program (USARP) biologist and Station Scientific Leader at Palmer Station in 1973. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as an \u201cother use\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to two hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have not stated your willingness to pay FOIA processing fees.  The FOIA requires that you explicitly state your willingness to pay all FOIA processing fees associated with processing your request, that you will pay fees up to a specified amount, and/or that you are seeking a fee waiver.  Therefore, we cannot fully comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the written assurance that you are willing to pay all FOIA processing fees or that you are willing to pay FOIA processing fees up to a certain amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to our regulations, if we do not receive your written assurance to pay all FOIA processing fees or FOIA processing fees up to a certain amount within 20 workdays from the date of this communication, no later than February 26, 2024, we will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request.  In such a circumstance, we will not be able to comply with your request and will close our file on it.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.5(d).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may appeal this response to the Department of the Interior\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer.  If you choose to appeal, the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer must receive your FOIA appeal no later than 90 workdays from the date of this letter.  Appeals arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, will be deemed received on the next workday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour appeal must be made in writing.  You may submit your appeal and accompanying materials to the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer by mail, courier service, fax, or email.  All communications concerning your appeal should be clearly marked with the words: \"FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.\"  You must include an explanation of why you believe the USGS\u2019s response is in error.  You must also include with your appeal copies of all correspondence between you and USGS concerning your FOIA request, including your original FOIA request and USGS's response.  Failure to include with your appeal all correspondence between you and USGS will result in the Department's rejection of your appeal, unless the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer determines (in the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer\u2019s sole discretion) that good cause exists to accept the defective appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease include your name and daytime telephone number (or the name and telephone number of an appropriate contact), email address and fax number (if available) in case the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer needs additional information or clarification of your appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOI FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Office Contact Information\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Interior\r\n\r\nOffice of the Solicitor\r\n\r\n1849 C Street, Northwest\r\n\r\nMS-6556 MIB\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20240\r\n\r\nAttn: FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Office\r\n\r\nTelephone:      (202) 208-5339\r\n\r\nFax:                 (202) 208-6677\r\n\r\nEmail:             FOIA.Appeals@sol.doi.gov\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Seven months of repeated delays are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request. Considering similar requests I've had fulfilled by SCOC, I anticipate this one to result in well under 100 pages of mostly boilerplate releasable records.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, SCOC is required by law to, within 10 business days, provide specific reasons why this request cannot be fulfilled, or else must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by \r\nthe specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is  unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied. In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with Public Officers Law \u00a789.4(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing  such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the  person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who  shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",
