        "communication": "Andrew Free \nMuckRock News DEPT MR 122335, 411A Highland Ave \nSomerville, Massachusetts 02144-2516 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2022-ICFO-14106 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 12/22/2021.  You have requested all records pertaining to FOIA request 2021-ICFO-32710. This request includes, but is not limited to search taskings, processing notes, and communication regarding the agency\u2019s processing and response.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Office of the Freedom of Information Act for records responsive to your request produced 17 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 16 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \n\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

On June 28, 2024, FOIA specialist Lora Bright wrote to me: \u201cI\u2019m pending a response from one more program office and I\u2019m hoping to have our response to you by October 31, 2024.\u201d This date came and went, and in response to my further query, she wrote, on October 31, 2024: \u201cWe are finalizing our response to you. I expect to have it completed by November 30, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis date also came and went, and all of my follow up messages (five so far) have been ignored. I also called and left a phone message with this FOIA specialist, which was also ignored. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, some months before the release of Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d film, then-Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm announced that DOE had \u201cvacated\u201d the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s finding that Dr. Oppenheimer\u2019s security clearance should be revoked:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-statement-doe-order-vacating-1954-atomic-energy-commission-decision\r\n\r\n This decision appeared to be timed to coincide with the release of the film, which goes out of its way to underscore Dr. Oppenheimer\u2019s innocence. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I made the request with NNSA after a FOIA specialist indicated to me on the phone (in connection with a different DOE FOIA request) that the production of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d used US government nuclear facilities. \r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect, therefore, that the government is deliberately delaying the release of these documents, which would demonstrate a close collaboration between the government and the production team, lest public disclosure of said collaboration undermine the film\u2019s historically dubious messaging\u2014messaging which was already endorsed by DOE before the release of the film. The delay, in fact, has already undermined the public\u2019s ability to scrutinize this messaging, since the film has long since moved from the center of public consciousness.\r\n\r\nI am therefore appealing the constructive denial of my request and asking that the agency respond to my request forthwith, providing the documents requested or outlining reasons that they are exempt.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

When it was reported that large boulders had fallen onto U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50), Caltrans, in cooperation with the California Highway Patrol (CHP), immediately closed the highway to protect the public. Safety is Caltrans\u2019 top priority. Caltrans has procedures in place to securely remove road hazards and keep all highways safe for motorists. U.S. 50 just east of Echo Summit has been historically susceptible to rockslides due to its topography. During the winter of 2022, the hillside above the highway was particularly vulnerable from winter storms due to the Caldor Fire that burned over Echo Summit along the highway in August and September of 2021. In the months after the fire, Caltrans crews worked with a contractor to conduct rock scaling operations to lessen the potential for rockslides, as hundreds of trees that help stabilize the hillsides were destroyed in the blaze. Caltrans\u2019 rapid response in cooperation with the CHP helped ensure the safety of the traveling public. Caltrans closely monitors Echo Summit and removes loose rocks that pose a hazard to U.S. 50. Highway safety is a key part of Caltrans\u2019 2024-2025 strategic plan, and our vision is zero deaths and serious injuries on California\u2019s roads by 2050. Caltrans has adopted the Safe System Approach, which seeks to design roadway environments that mitigate human mistakes and encourage safer behaviors. Caltrans is committed to maintaining and improving the state\u2019s transportation network to make it safer, more reliable and more resilient. For more information on the Safe System Approach, click here Please let me know if you have any question s. Sincerely, John O\u2019Connell \r\nCaltrans District 3 CPRA Coordinator (530) 701-9459",

Records concerning Ellsberg as the main subject have diminished privacy interest under both FOIA and the Privacy Act and are disclosable.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",

McElwee: \r\n\r\nA search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request CBP-FO-2023-097944, requesting records maintained by CBP. \r\n\r\nCBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below: \r\n\r\nExemption Summary: \r\n(b)(6) (b)(7)(C) \r\nPursuant to exemption  (b)(6) (b)(7)(C), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 2 pages in part. \r\nPermits withholding of records and information about individuals when disclosure would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nPermits withholding of records when an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy could reasonably be expected. \r\n(b)(7)(E) \r\nPursuant to exemption  (b)(7)(E), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 2 pages in part. \r\nPermits withholding of records when techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or process would be disclosed or provided such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of law. \r\n\r\nPursuant to DHS Instruction 262-11-004, FOIA Officers at DHS have been instructed to withhold personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) of DHS personnel unless a determination is made that the disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns, or if those concerns are outweighed by any public interest in that information. This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately [0] pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2023-097944 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \r\nSincerely, \r\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

This estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, provide third party notice, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request may be produced in installments.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

These and other records thus made available will, we hope and expect, be referenced in research papers and other writings, and the mere availability of them makes the public aware of an entire field of government operations (namely, collaboration with Hollywood) of which the public is largely not aware. This increased awareness, in turn, has the potential to transform the way the public sees films. Furthermore, I am the editor-in-chief of a research magazine published by said foundation  called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" to which I also contribute articles (including a recent article on NASA's relationship to Hollywood). The magazine explores, among other topics, Hollywood's relationship to the federal government, and such documents indeed are cited in the magazine.\r\n\r\nI therefore repeat my request for a waiver of fees, having rebutted the finding that this work does not contribute in any significant way to the public's understanding of government. \r\n\r\nIn the event that this waiver request is not accepted, I still wish you to process the FOIA request, under the stipulations stated in the original request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

In order for IU to begin processing your request, you will need to provide further information regarding the record(s) you are requesting. APRA requires that a request for inspection and/or copying must identify with reasonable particularity the record(s) being requested. I.C. 5-14-3-3(a)(1). The Indiana Court of Appeals has held that \"[w]hether a request identifies with reasonable particularity the record being requested turns, in part, on whether the person making the request provides the agency with information that enables the agency to search for, locate and retrieve records.\" Jent v. Fort Wayne Police Dep't, 973 N.E.2d 30, 34 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\r\nAs currently written, your below request does not identify reasonably particular parameters that enable the University to \"search for, locate and retrieve records.\" While the term \"reasonable particularity\" is not defined within APRA, I encourage you to read the many opinions of the Indiana Public Access Counselor, along with Anderson v. Huntington Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 983 N.E.2d 613 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013).\r\n\r\nPer this authority, please further specify the type(s) of record(s) that you are seeking in response to your request below.

Specifically:\r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

The period of said report shall be from October 1st, 2020 to August 24th, 2021. \n\nPlease include in the said report: \n- Expected Departures \n- Out-of country Overstays \n- Suspected In-Country Overstays \n- Include age groups and gender \n\nRecords are attached to this email. \n\nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, CBP has determined that they are approved for release in their entirety, no deletions or exemptions have been applied. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-2021-098543 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Mr. Scott,\r\n\r\nAs you know, our office is the City Attorney for the City of Irvine and Irvine Police Department (collectively, the \u201cCity\u201d).  Please allow this correspondence to serve as the City\u2019s follow-up correspondence to your public records act (\u201cPRA\u201d) request below.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the City has reviewed your PRA request and has determined it seeks an excessively large volume of potentially responsive documents spanning a 10-year period, which at this time, would pose a significant undue burden on limited staff time and resources.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to streamline the documents you seek, the City is requesting further clarification pertaining to the categories of records requested below:\r\n\r\n- Any accounting records or statistics on seized real estate, vehicles, firearms, funds in bank accounts, and seizures made by the department, as well as seizures made by federal authorities where the department receives a share under the MOUs the department has in place with numerous agencies describing how assets are to be divided. Please clarify whether you seek information on all seized items, or whether this is specifically requesting information on seizures relating to asset forfeiture.  As phrased, the request is ambiguous and overbroad.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\n- Sales of non-monetary assets, receipts of sale for vehicles, or the destruction of other non-monetary assets. Please clarify whether this category is specific to asset forfeitures.  As phrased, it is ambiguous and overbroad.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\n-Please also include any information relating to contested seizures. This request does not include court documents for individual forfeiture cases.  This request as phrased\u2014\u201cany information\u201d\u2014is incredibly overbroad.  Please identify which types of documents and/or specific categories of records you seek.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nFinally, as your request spans a 10-year period, please understand the City will need additional time to locate potentially responsive records to this request.  If you could further narrow the time-period requested, it would expedite the processing of these documents for disclosure.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  We look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nKelsey\r\n\r\nKelsey Quist<http://www.rutan.com/Kelsey-Quist>\r\n18575 Jamboree Road, 9th Floor | Irvine, CA 92612\r\nO. (714) 641-5100 | D.

The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nAny ledgers, databases, invoices, receipts, and documentation tracking the acquisition, sales, destruction, or donations of seized real estate, vehicles, firearms, or funds in bank accounts should be included. Information related to the date, quantity, cost, invoices, item description, what was bought, what was sold, and what was donated should also be included. \r\n\r\n-Please also include any information relating to contested seizures.
