Richard Allen was convicted and sentenced October 31st 2024 and the judge assured that after the gag order was lifted at sentencing trial exhibits would be made public as the transcript is being prepared. She has since then instructed her court reporter to advise the public that possibly someday these will be made available. Considering the length of time I am asking for all exhibits used in the trial that were not sealed.  Indiana Public Records Act \"APRA\" Indiana Code 5-14-3 et seq requires these exhibits to be made public. Considering the volumne of these exhibits some delay is understandable. Four months is no longer understandable and the excuses given to the media who have requested them are ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChristine Calderon",
