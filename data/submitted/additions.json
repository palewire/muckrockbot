If you still feel you are unable to complete this Request, please request an Attorney General Opinion as required by law. Below is the statue for reference along with the requirements for withholding information.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n-B\r\n\r\nA. \r\nDuties of the Governmental Body and of the Attorney General Under \r\nSubchapter G \r\nSections 552.301, 552.302, and 552.303 of the Government Code set out the duty of a \r\ngovernmental body to seek the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether information is excepted \r\nfrom disclosure to the public. \r\nSection 552.301, subsections (a) and (b), provides that when a governmental body receives a \r\nwritten request for information the governmental body wishes to withhold, it must seek an attorney \r\ngeneral decision within ten business days of its receipt of the request and state the exceptions to \r\ndisclosure that it believes are applicable.  Subsections (a) and (b) read: \r\n(a) A governmental body that receives a written request for information that it wishes \r\nto withhold from public disclosure and that it considers to be within one of the \r\nexceptions under Subchapter C must ask for a decision from the attorney general \r\nabout whether the information is within that exception if there has not been a \r\nprevious determination about whether the information falls within one of the \r\nexceptions. \r\n. . . \r\n(b) The governmental body must ask for the attorney general\u2019s decision and state the \r\nexceptions that apply within a reasonable time but not later than the 10th business \r\nday after the date of receiving the written request. \r\nThus, a governmental body that wishes to withhold information from the public on the ground of \r\nan exception generally must seek the decision of the attorney general as to the applicability of that \r\nexception.144  In addition, an entity contending that it is not subject to the Act may timely request \r\na decision from the attorney general to avoid the consequences of noncompliance if the entity is \r\ndetermined to be subject to the Act.145  Therefore, when requesting such a decision, the entity \r\n\r\nshould not only present its arguments as to why it is not subject to the Act, but should also raise \r\nany exceptions to required disclosure it believes apply to the requested information. \r\nA governmental body need not request an attorney general decision if there has been a previous \r\ndetermination that the requested material falls within one of the exceptions to disclosure.146  What \r\nconstitutes a \u201cprevious determination\u201d is narrow in scope, and governmental bodies are cautioned \r\nagainst treating most published attorney general decisions as \u201cprevious determinations\u201d to avoid \r\nthe requirements of section 552.301(a).  The attorney general has determined that there are two \r\ntypes of previous determinations.147  The first and by far the most common instance of a previous \r\ndetermination pertains to specific information that is again requested from a governmental body \r\nwhen the attorney general has previously issued a decision that evaluates the public availability of \r\nthe precise information or records at issue.  This first instance of a previous determination does \r\nnot apply to records that are substantially similar to records previously submitted to the attorney \r\ngeneral for review, nor does it apply to information that may fall within the same category as any \r\ngiven records on which the attorney general has previously ruled.  The first type of previous \r\ndetermination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue is precisely the same information that was previously submitted to \r\nthe attorney general pursuant to section 552.301(e)(1)(D) of the Government Code; \r\n2. the governmental body that received the request for the information is the same \r\ngovernmental body that previously requested and received a ruling from the attorney \r\ngeneral; \r\n3. the attorney general\u2019s prior ruling concluded the precise information is or is not excepted \r\nfrom disclosure under the Act; and \r\n4. the law, facts, and circumstances on which the prior attorney general ruling was based have \r\nnot changed since the issuance of the ruling.148 \r\nAbsent all four of the above criteria, and unless the second type of previous determination applies, \r\na governmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nfrom the public information that is requested under the Act. \r\nThe second type of previous determination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue falls within a specific, clearly delineated category of information \r\nabout which the attorney general has previously rendered a decision;\r\n2. the previous decision is applicable to the particular governmental body or type of \r\ngovernmental body from which the information is requested;149 \r\n3. the previous decision concludes the specific, clearly delineated category of information is \r\nor is not excepted from disclosure under the Act; \r\n4. the elements of law, fact, and circumstances are met to support the previous decision\u2019s \r\nconclusion that the requested records or information at issue is or is not excepted from \r\nrequired disclosure; and150 \r\n5. the previous decision explicitly provides that the governmental body or bodies to which \r\nthe decision applies may withhold the information without the necessity of again seeking \r\na decision from the attorney general. \r\nAbsent all five of the above criteria, and unless the first type of previous determination applies, a \r\ngovernmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nrequested information from the public under the Act.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n(b)  Information in appraisal records under Section 25.02 is confidential and is available only for the official use of the appraisal district, this state, the comptroller, and taxing units and political subdivisions of this state if:\r\n(1)  the information identifies the home address of a named individual to whom this section applies; and\r\n(2)  the individual:\r\n\r\n(A)  chooses to restrict public access to the information on the form prescribed for that purpose by the comptroller under Section 5.07; or\r\n\r\n(B)  is a federal or state judge, or the spouse of a federal or state judge, beginning on the date the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System notifies the appraisal district of the judge's qualification for the judge's office.\r\n(c)  A choice made under Subsection (b) remains valid until rescinded in writing by the individual.\r\n(d)  This section does not prohibit the public disclosure of information in appraisal records that identifies property according to an address if the information does not identify an individual who has made an election under Subsection (b) in connection with the individual's address.\r\n",

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.
