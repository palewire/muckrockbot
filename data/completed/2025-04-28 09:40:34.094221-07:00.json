There were no redactions applied to this installment. As I previously stated, I am working with others both within and outside of DAJD to process this request. This request will be quite large and will take over 12 months to complete. At this time, I am unable to provide a more definitive completion estimate as the Care and Closure process is still on-going. I have been advised that there may be thousands of emails and documents/records responsive to this request and they may be held by numerous County agencies and departments. I will need to Coordinate with numerous others to locate, obtain and process all responsive records. My estimate of 12+ months may be wrong and it may end up taking longer than that to complete this request. I have scheduled the next installment for 1/10/2024. Due to the upcoming holidays and needing to coordinate with others, this installment is later than usual and most future installments will not have as long of a timeframe between them. Please contact me if you have any questions.

There were no redactions applied to this installment. I received your email regarding not being able to access the previous installments. I am not quite sure what is going on, as I have not been able to find a solution. If you are able to provide a second email address, I can add that to the OneDrive access to see if that works. If that does not work, I may need to come up with a completely different system for delivering installments to you. With this installment, I have provided all of the reports that have been given to me regarding Care and Closure. I am interpreting your request as, \"a request for documents (including memos) sent by DAJD or received from the Executive's Office related to the CCFJC closure? Is this correct? If so, please confirm \u00a0by 3/22/2024, and I will ensure my colleagues are continuing to collect responsive records. If this is not correct, please let me know and I will re-engage with my colleagues and we will revise our search for records. If you could provide a secondary email address and confirmation of my interpretation by 3/22/24, I would appreciate it. If I hear back from you, I have scheduled the next installment of records for no later than the end of the day on 4/4/2024. I will also provide a link to this installment in a separate email. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Our office receives over 12,000 records requests annually, one of our main priorities is to provide those responsive records to your request in a reasonable timeframe and as efficiently as possible. In order to do that we would like to work with you to identify possible ways to narrow your request so that we are only searching for and reviewing those records that contain the information you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the most time intensive records to review are APD lapel video (a 1-hour recording requires 3-4 hours to review and redact). In most cases, the first responding officer\u2019s lapel video contains the information most requesters seek. If you are able to narrow/tailor your request to that officer\u2019s lapel it can avoid tens to hundreds of hours of review and redaction (which results in additional time needed to respond to your request).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you choose to proactively reach out to our office, we will work with you to better understand your records request and will offer suggestions on ways your request can be further specified to obtain those records you seek as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invitation to contact our office to narrow your request is voluntary and does not alter any of your rights to inspect public records under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act. If you decline our offer to assist in narrowing your request, we will conduct a reasonable search and process your request accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have or later acquire documents relating to your request, please let us know and upload the records into NextRequest. Such additional information has proven to be a useful resource in identifying, locating, and producing additional records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDominic Leyba\r\n\r\nIPRA Tech\r\n\r\nOffice of the City Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Albuquerque.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

NOTE: This includes: all but the last four digits of a (1) taxpayer ID number; (2) financial account number; (3) credit/debit card number; (4) driver\u2019s license number; AND (5) all but the year of a person\u2019s date of birth; AND (6) social security number; AND (7) nonelected government employee\u2019s home street address, but not the city state or zip code. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-6-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also determined it was necessary and appropriate to redact/blur the officers\u2019 computer screen videos to avoid potential disclosure of information from the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC). See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information); \u00a7 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21-21, .33). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also redacted certain information which could reveal the identities of undercover police officers or informants.\u00a0This information is exempt from the Inspection of Public Records Act.\u00a0See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information). If made public, the redacted information would seriously interfere with the effectiveness of criminal investigations and prosecutions, and endanger undercover police officers or informants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also redacted/exempted certain tactical information pursuant to\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1(I) (tactical response plans or procedures). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also redacted/exempted some confidential law enforcement information.\u00a0See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1 (D) (law enforcement records), including \u00a714-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, \u00a714-2-1.2(A)(5); and NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including the City of Albuquerque\u2019s Open Records Ordinance, ROA 1994, Section 2-7-6-5(C)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive records:\r\n\r\n* * Lapel Videos - Part 1 (shared via Evidence.com at no charge)\r\n\r\n* Please let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos. The videos provided include those from the officer most directly related in the incident along with several others. There are approximately 171 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process. If you do want additional lapel videos, if you can narrow your request in any way (such as, to specific officers or events), your request may be fulfilled sooner. Otherwise, it will take a significant amount of time for all the videos to be reviewed and made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPending records:\r\n\r\n* * Additional Lapel Videos (if requested)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lapel videos responsive to your request were shared with you via Evidence.com; you will receive a link from Evidence.com which will prompt you to create an account in order to view the videos. If you did not receive the link from Evidence.com, please check your junk/spam folder. Please be advised: you cannot share or forward the link from Evidence.com, because this will void the link and you will not be able to access the videos. Additionally, the videos are only active for 90-days, but you may download them at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list reflects my understanding of the records that have been completed and processed and the records on which we are still working.\u00a0If you have a different understanding or believe there are other records outstanding, please contact me as soon as possible.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be notified when additional records become available. Thank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, please contact the City Clerk's office at (505) 924-3650 for assistance in troubleshooting.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER C.

Your request is still open with our office, and we apologize for the delay.\u00a0We will be in touch as we have additional information about your request or as we complete processing your records.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos.\u00a0The videos provided include those from the officer most directly related in the incident along with several others.\u00a0There are approximately 171 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process.

Our office receives over 12,000 records requests annually, one of our main priorities is to provide those responsive records to your request in a reasonable timeframe and as efficiently as possible. In order to do that we would like to work with you to identify possible ways to narrow your request so that we are only searching for and reviewing those records that contain the information you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the most time intensive records to review are APD lapel video (a 1-hour recording requires 3-4 hours to review and redact). In most cases, the first responding officer\u2019s lapel video contains the information most requesters seek. If you are able to narrow/tailor your request to that officer\u2019s lapel it can avoid tens to hundreds of hours of review and redaction (which results in additional time needed to respond to your request).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you choose to proactively reach out to our office, we will work with you to better understand your records request and will offer suggestions on ways your request can be further specified to obtain those records you seek as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invitation to contact our office to narrow your request is voluntary and does not alter any of your rights to inspect public records under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act. If you decline our offer to assist in narrowing your request, we will conduct a reasonable search and process your request accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have or later acquire documents relating to your request, please let us know and upload the records into NextRequest.

NOTE: This includes: all but the last four digits of a (1) taxpayer ID number; (2) financial account number; (3) credit/debit card number; (4) driver\u2019s license number; AND (5) all but the year of a person\u2019s date of birth; AND (6) social security number; AND (7) nonelected government employee\u2019s home street address, but not the city state or zip code. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-6-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also determined it was necessary and appropriate to redact/blur the officers\u2019 computer screen videos to avoid potential disclosure of information from the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC). See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information); \u00a7 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21-21, .33). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive records:\r\n\r\n* * Lapel Videos - Part 1 (shared via Evidence.com at no charge)\r\n\r\n* Please let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos. The videos provided should be from the officers most directly involved in the incident, including any who fired their weapons. There are approximately 155 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process. If you do want additional lapel videos, if you can narrow your request in any way (such as, to specific officers or events), your request may be fulfilled sooner. Otherwise, it will take a significant amount of time for all the videos to be reviewed and made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPending records:\r\n\r\n* * Additional Lapel Videos (if requested)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lapel videos responsive to your request were shared with you via Evidence.com; you will receive a link from Evidence.com which will prompt you to create an account in order to view the videos. If you did not receive the link from Evidence.com, please check your junk/spam folder. Please be advised: you cannot share or forward the link from Evidence.com, because this will void the link and you will not be able to access the videos. Additionally, the videos are only active for 90-days, but you may download them at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list reflects my understanding of the records that have been completed and processed and the records on which we are still working.\u00a0If you have a different understanding or believe there are other records outstanding, please contact me as soon as possible.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be notified when additional records become available. Thank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, please contact the City Clerk's office at (505) 924-3650 for assistance in troubleshooting.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER C.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll bureau files covering investigations into the Minutemen organization in the following cities: Chicago (105-11643), Los Angeles (62-5101), Miami (105-4921), Phoenix (105-1226), and San Diego (100-12461). The Minutemen were a right-wing paramilitary group founded in June 1960 by businessman Robert Bolivar DePugh and operated in some capacity in cities throughout the United States between 1960 and 1969. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has already made public files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and Minutemen operations in cities like New York City, so I am asking the FBI provide copies of files on these additional cities so the public may have a greater understanding of this organization and its place within the social unrest of the sixties.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I have written for Philly Voice and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To FOIA Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information (FOIA) Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following:\r\n\r\nOn November 22, 2022, I submitted Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request number 1510574-000 via MuckRock seeking all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records on the Chicago chapter of paramilitary group the Minutemen. At that time, I included the chapter\u2019s Bureau file number (105-11643) for reference purposes.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2022, I received a response letter from the FBI releasing only one page from the chapter\u2019s Bureau file and rejecting the rest of my request. The rejection letter cited FOIA exemptions (b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1), (b)(6), (b)(7)(c), and (b)(7)(e). I am appealing these exemptions for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(c): Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(c) are written to protect the rights of individuals against a clear and unwarranted \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d with (b)(6) specifically covering personnel and medical files. First, I am not requesting personnel or medical files; I am asking for files from investigations into a right-wing paramilitary group. I believe exemption (b)(6) may have been included in error and request a review of this exemption.\r\n\r\nNext, persons and groups may retain privacy rights under some circumstances, but, per the United States Court of Appeals, District Columbia Circuit, in Fund for Constitutional Government v. National Archives & Records Service, these rights yield \u201cwhere exceptional interests militate in favor of disclosure.\u201d Through actions and public statements made by Minuteman founder Robert Bolivar DePugh, the Minutemen and any subsequent chapters have no expectations of privacy because they are figures of exceptional public interest. Mr. DePugh spoke at length with newspapers about the group and participated in an unofficial biography, published in 1968 under the title \"The Minutemen\" (later re-released in 1969 as \"A Private Army\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the FBI has already released files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and the Minutemen to researcher John Greenwald, Jr. in 2018, as part of FOIPA request number 1415062-000 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). Other files on the New York City chapter were released to researcher Ernie Lazar prior to that (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). These documents are publicly accessible in a variety of formats as of the writing of this appeal; Mr. Greenwald\u2019s can be found on his site, The Black Vault, while Mr. Lazar\u2019s are collected at the Internet Archive. Privacy concerns cannot be re-extended to figures where they have already been waived or determined no longer applicable.\r\n\r\n(b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1) and (b)(7)(e): These exemption cover information that disclose \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d and \u201ctechniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\" However, these would not apply as the group in question, the Minutemen, ceased operations and disbanded in the 1970s. Although individuals may have claimed to revive the group at various points since then, there are no active chapters of the Minutemen at this time. The group\u2019s founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, passed away on June 30, 2009 (attached as \"Minuteman outlasted notoriety...\"). In the absence of a functioning body and the death of Mr. DePugh, the release of these files would not risk circumvention of the law by any living parties.\r\n\r\nMany of the intelligence sources for the FBI have also been disclosed elsewhere. These individuals include: Michael Desmond Sadewhite, who served as a Bureau informant from 1966 until 1967 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"); Henry Edward Warren, who disclosed information on the Minutemen from 1966 to 1968; and Jerry Milton Brooks, who testified against Mr. DePugh in 1966 and later claimed to have worked as an informant for both the FBI and then-Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit. These individuals have all been identified publicly in newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s or in J. Harry Jones\u2019s book \"The Minutemen\".\r\n\r\nAlso, as previously mentioned, documents containing information about Mr. DePugh and the Minutemen have been released in other FOIPA releases in the past. Any concerns over disclosures with regard to intelligence sources or law enforcement investigation techniques or methods would have been voided upon the release of those documents.\r\n\r\nFinally, I am renewing my request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including CovertAction Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the FBI's Information Management Division does in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Seidel, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Information Management Division, inquiring if I would like to continue with FOIPA requests 1510698-000 and 1510700-000, for information on the Minutemen organiation. Please consider this communication confirmation of my intention to continue with these requests. No circumstances have changed on my end, and I am still very much interested in obtaining these records.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to renew my request for a fee waiver. My bylines include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your guidance through the FOIPA process.

Any and all records mentioning, referencing, or concerning Roy Den Hollander (September 26, 1947 - July 20, 2020). \r\n\r\nRoy Den Hollander was an American lawyer who gained notoriety as a suspected murderer after acting as an attorney in several unsuccessful sex discrimination suits on behalf of men. He was, allegedly, also a private investigator in Russia (Kroll Associates Russia).\r\n\r\nDen Hollander, who had earlier stated he was \"dying from cancer\", was found dead on July 20, 2020, outside a rental car from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, which contributed to him being made a suspect in the July 2020 murder of lawyer Marc Angelucci in California and, eight days later, an attack on the family of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in New Jersey, in which Salas's son Daniel Anderl was killed and Salas's husband, Mark Anderl, was seriously wounded.\r\n\r\nProof of death in links below:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/roy-den-hollander-murder-suicide-48-hours/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/213865536/roy-den_hollander\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoanne Riford",

He was, allegedly, also a private\r\n    investigator in Russia (Kroll Associates Russia).\r\n    \r\n    Den Hollander, who had earlier stated he was \"dying from cancer\", was found\r\n    dead on July 20, 2020, outside a rental car from an apparent self-inflicted\r\n    gunshot wound, which contributed to him being made a suspect in the July\r\n    2020 murder of lawyer Marc Angelucci in California and, eight days later, an\r\n    attack on the family of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in New Jersey, in\r\n    which Salas's son Daniel Anderl was killed and Salas's husband, Mark Anderl,\r\n    was seriously wounded.\r\n    \r\n    Proof of death in links below:\r\n    \r\n    https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roy-den-hollander-murder-suicide-48-hours/\r\n    \r\n    https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/213865536/roy-den_hollander\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Where non-disclosable portions of public records are \u201creasonably segregable\u201d from the disclosable portions, the agency may withhold or redact the non-disclosable portions while producing the disclosable portions. Thus, redactions are permitted under the CPRA, as long as the basis for the redaction (specified exemption) is identified in the agency\u2019s response. See Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.525(a)-(b) American Civ. Liberties Union Found\u2019n v.

        "communication": "Andrew Free \nMuckRock News DEPT MR 122335, 411A Highland Ave \nSomerville, Massachusetts 02144-2516 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2022-ICFO-14106 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 12/22/2021.  You have requested all records pertaining to FOIA request 2021-ICFO-32710. This request includes, but is not limited to search taskings, processing notes, and communication regarding the agency\u2019s processing and response.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Office of the Freedom of Information Act for records responsive to your request produced 17 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 16 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \n\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMegan Davis \nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \n\nEnclosure(s):\t22 Pages \nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.\n",

Bodycam footage reportedly captures officers encouraging Nino\u2019s father to physically discipline him, dismissing allegations of abuse, and making statements such as \"Your dad should beat you\" and \"You have no rights.\" A confrontation ensued when Officer Willer attempted to take Nino\u2019s phone, resulting in officers using force against him. Nino suffered a broken wrist, facial lacerations requiring stitches, and was subsequently hospitalized. He was charged with aggravated assault, though charges were later dropped.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nSpoke with Sergio Nino\u2019s father before engaging with the teenager.\r\nInteracted with Sergio Nino, including advising his father on discipline.\r\nUsed force on Nino, leading to his injuries and subsequent arrest.\r\nTransported Nino from the scene to medical facilities or booking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",

On June 28, 2024, FOIA specialist Lora Bright wrote to me: \u201cI\u2019m pending a response from one more program office and I\u2019m hoping to have our response to you by October 31, 2024.\u201d This date came and went, and in response to my further query, she wrote, on October 31, 2024: \u201cWe are finalizing our response to you. I expect to have it completed by November 30, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis date also came and went, and all of my follow up messages (five so far) have been ignored. I also called and left a phone message with this FOIA specialist, which was also ignored. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, some months before the release of Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d film, then-Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm announced that DOE had \u201cvacated\u201d the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s finding that Dr. Oppenheimer\u2019s security clearance should be revoked:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-statement-doe-order-vacating-1954-atomic-energy-commission-decision\r\n\r\n This decision appeared to be timed to coincide with the release of the film, which goes out of its way to underscore Dr. Oppenheimer\u2019s innocence. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I made the request with NNSA after a FOIA specialist indicated to me on the phone (in connection with a different DOE FOIA request) that the production of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d used US government nuclear facilities. \r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect, therefore, that the government is deliberately delaying the release of these documents, which would demonstrate a close collaboration between the government and the production team, lest public disclosure of said collaboration undermine the film\u2019s historically dubious messaging\u2014messaging which was already endorsed by DOE before the release of the film. The delay, in fact, has already undermined the public\u2019s ability to scrutinize this messaging, since the film has long since moved from the center of public consciousness.\r\n\r\nI am therefore appealing the constructive denial of my request and asking that the agency respond to my request forthwith, providing the documents requested or outlining reasons that they are exempt.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

When it was reported that large boulders had fallen onto U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50), Caltrans, in cooperation with the California Highway Patrol (CHP), immediately closed the highway to protect the public. Safety is Caltrans\u2019 top priority. Caltrans has procedures in place to securely remove road hazards and keep all highways safe for motorists. U.S. 50 just east of Echo Summit has been historically susceptible to rockslides due to its topography. During the winter of 2022, the hillside above the highway was particularly vulnerable from winter storms due to the Caldor Fire that burned over Echo Summit along the highway in August and September of 2021. In the months after the fire, Caltrans crews worked with a contractor to conduct rock scaling operations to lessen the potential for rockslides, as hundreds of trees that help stabilize the hillsides were destroyed in the blaze. Caltrans\u2019 rapid response in cooperation with the CHP helped ensure the safety of the traveling public. Caltrans closely monitors Echo Summit and removes loose rocks that pose a hazard to U.S. 50. Highway safety is a key part of Caltrans\u2019 2024-2025 strategic plan, and our vision is zero deaths and serious injuries on California\u2019s roads by 2050. Caltrans has adopted the Safe System Approach, which seeks to design roadway environments that mitigate human mistakes and encourage safer behaviors. Caltrans is committed to maintaining and improving the state\u2019s transportation network to make it safer, more reliable and more resilient. For more information on the Safe System Approach, click here Please let me know if you have any question s. Sincerely, John O\u2019Connell \r\nCaltrans District 3 CPRA Coordinator (530) 701-9459",
