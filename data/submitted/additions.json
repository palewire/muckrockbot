Please provide the following: \r\n  \r\n The most responsive document the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney's Office has regarding a pursuit policy was previously released to you in CDA-2023-1108 on July 14, 2023. If there are additional documents you are seeking, please clarify for us what else you are in need of. As it currently stands, the Tarrant County CDA has no further documents responsive to your request. However, if you can provide more details as to what other documents you may be looking for, we can attempt to further process your request. \r\n  \r\n If you are seeking the pursuit policy of the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office, you will need to place a request with that office using the information at this link: http://url2602.justfoia.com/ls/click?upn=XfJvxk0gd1RbNAoCtqw15rPJu4R2c81FEmlttL0Fd6RbVKtU7X-2Fj5oUbN3e3Z7KDDXdI931mzNZpj5R7J3X3wVE22YfkMm31zeg7DH53HOIKWcmMVLeveI82allGQXSpdC9BEsMDwEALUx8VKxQeifN8HKppyfzvn-2Fc8R0-2BQw3w-3Dt-YM_5-2B4OiBe2rmNzqz6tmFNKDeA-2FS4Sl1YtsHEuuz2lkG-2BzCIy3UI1Ktub6GImwjl3SklkNovE4FnPzRa-2BMRQ6k3OPbVfdVF76TpdLWfWnJdumtSmIKwKGUiuIsC81R13XouyPwR0mFk8A4PQJln4mBGtoYw8x7BA14JFHW0YzmY2RStPdANYUF2Wxc37ttcvU49qCZ4rydr2GUEvD-2BjI8pPvoePIZJCjICLQOiGW-2FwVQFk2oSCzNtux5FQaNNfKIyKiExEdbPs3weNwccNIGHd8V5igNru7XN6KIrkXQfvx2kxIX6RCsRlNhdjM3oMcE42tyjf4-2FCD0iBfziooS79L9IQ-3D-3D \r\n  \r\n Per Texas Government Code section 552.222, if a written response to this request for clarification or narrowing is not received within 61 days, your request is considered withdrawn. \r\n  \r\n Description of records requested: \r\n  \r\n This is a follow up to request number CDA-2023-1108: To Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records: All current policies maintained by the department regarding vehicle pursuits (also known as: car chase, vehicular response policy, vehicular pursuit procedure).
