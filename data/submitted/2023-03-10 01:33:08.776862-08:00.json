        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nSubject: Missouri Sunshine Law Request, \r\nMissouri Public Records Request-IMSI - Catcher Devices/Equipment\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nCell site simulators, also known as IMSI catchers, IMEI catchers, GSM interceptors, covert cellular tracking equipment, and digital analyzers, impersonate a wireless service provider\u2019s (i.e., mobile phone company\u2019s or cellular phone company\u2019s) cell tower, prompting mobile phones and other wireless devices to communicate with the simulators instead of communicating with authentic cell towers. These devices are often called \u201cStingrays,\u201d the name of one such device produced by Harris Corporation, along with their AmberJack, BlackFin, KingFish, Gossamer, LoggerHead, and TriggerFish. They are also referred to by the names of Hailstorm, ArrowHead and DRT \u201cDirt\u201d Box. \r\n\r\nCell site simulators are commonly used in several ways: to collect unique numeric identifiers associated with each mobile phone in a given geographic area, to determine the precise location of the mobile phone when numbers associated with it are known but only a general idea of its location is known, or to intercept phone calls and SMS messages. \r\n\r\nEach of these uses raises privacy concerns, the most obvious of which is presented by the interception of voice and SMS communications. Collecting unique identifiers of all phones in a particular area inevitably collects location data on many innocent people who would be suspected of no crime. Determination of the precise location of a specific phone can reveal that the phone, and thus the person who operates it, is in a constitutionally-protected place, such as their private home for instance, which has been traditionally immune from search without judicial approval via search warrant. The locations of people\u2019s mobile phones reveal a variety of personal information, such as: with whom they associate, where they frequent, where they spend their days, where they spend their nights, when they are home alone, where they work and worship, as well as the identities, locations and relationship details and patterns of their family, friends, associates or even service providers, such as their healthcare providers. \r\n\r\nIt has been widely reported in recent years that law enforcement agencies use these devices while hiding their use from the public and from the courts. Despite widespread public interest in the use and misuse of cell site simulators, the community has no information about your agency\u2019s use of these devices or your agency\u2019s policies for using these devices. Information is necessary for the public to determine whether the use of cell site simulators by your agency complies with the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and with Missouri state law.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords regarding your agency\u2019s acquisition of cell site simulators, including but not limited to invoices, purchase orders, contracts, loan agreements, evaluation agreements, solicitation letters, correspondence with companies and public agencies that provide the devices, and similar documents. \r\n\r\n2.\tRecords regarding any offer, proposal, arrangement, agreement or memorandum of understanding with St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (\u201cSTLMPD\u201d), St Louis County Police Department (\"STLCPD\"), St. Louis Fusion Center (\u201cSTLFC\u201d), Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), U.S. Marshals Service, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\u201cODNI\u201d), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Homeland Security Information Network (\u201cHSIN\u201d), U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), FBI\u2019s Data Intercept Technology Unit (\u201cDITU\u201d), FBI\u2019s Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (\u201cN-DEx\u201d), Mid-State Organized Crime Information Center (\u201cMOCIC\u201d), Regional Information Sharing Systems Technology Support Center (RTSC), or any corporation, to borrow, permanently acquire from, or use any cell site simulator owned or possessed by STLMPD, STLCPD, STLFC, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, ODNI, DHS, HSIN, DOJ, DITU, N-DEx, MOCIC, RTSC, or corporation. \r\n\r\n3.\tAll disclosure agreement documents with Harris Corporation, Digital Receiver Technology (DRT, formerly Utica Systems, now a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation), Septier Communication Limited, Proximus LLC, any other corporation and any state or federal agencies, regarding your agency\u2019s actual or potential possession or use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n4.\tRecords regarding policies and guidelines governing use of cell site simulators, including but not limited to 1) when, where, how, and against whom the devices may be used to target, 2) logging retention, purging, use and auditing data stored in or communicated from the devices, 3) under what circumstances administrative warrant, judicial warrant, or other legal process must, should or should not be obtained prior to during, or following direct or indirect use of the devices, 4) under what circumstances the existence or use of the devices must, should, or should not be revealed to judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, criminal defendants, or the general public., and 5) parallel construction techniques for use in avoidance of disclosure of the initial method of discovery of information gained initially by use of cell site simulators \r\n\r\n5.\tDocuments pertaining to training, including training materials and records that verify and document training for use of cell site simulators. Including protocol and procedure regarding collection, retention, dissemination of and disposition of citizen\u2019s private cell phone data    \r\n\r\n6.\tRecords regarding any communication or agreements with wireless service providers (i.e., mobile phone carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile/Sprint, Boost Mobile, MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile, Mint Mobile, Straight Talk, Spectrum, Consumer Cellular, etc.) concerning use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n7.\tRecords regarding any communications, licenses, waivers, or agreements, with federal or state communication regulatory agencies (e.g., Federal Communication Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Missouri Public Service Commission, National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, National Regulatory Research Institute, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, etc.) concerning use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n8.\tRecords reflecting the number of investigations in which cell site simulators were used, the number of those investigations that resulted in prosecutions, and the number of those investigations that resulted in convictions for the period of January 1, 2020 to the date of this request \r\n\r\n9.\tRecords reflecting a list of all criminal cases, with docket numbers if available, in which law enforcement officers or other staff used or arranged for the use of one or more cell site simulators as part of the underlying investigations for the period of January 1, 2020 to the date of this request\r\n\r\n10.\tAll applications submitted to state or federal courts for warrants, orders, or other authorization for use of cell site simulators in criminal investigations, as well as any warrants, orders, authorizations, denials of warrants, denials of warrants, denials of orders, denials of authorization, or returns of warrants associated with those applications for the period of January 1, 2020 to the date of this request\r\n\r\n11.\tRecords regarding the use of cell site simulators in closed investigations\r\n\r\n12.\tDate and docket number of any responsive records that are sealed\r\n\r\n13.\tAll associated records of metadata regarding the use of cell site simulators \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as this request is in the public\u2019s interest. \r\n\r\nIn addition to an email response, I request a copy to be sent through U.S. postal mail service as confirmation and an official record that cannot be modified or deleted. I will also be emailing and corresponding using the U.S. postal service to follow up with any additional responses regarding my request.

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P039340-030923.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \n Additional Research Time is Required: \nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \n \nSincerely, \nGerard G.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nSubject: Missouri Sunshine Law Request, \r\nMissouri Public Records Request-IMSI - Catcher Devices/Equipment\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nCell site simulators, also known as IMSI catchers, IMEI catchers, GSM interceptors, covert cellular tracking equipment, and digital analyzers, impersonate a wireless service provider\u2019s (i.e., mobile phone company\u2019s or cellular phone company\u2019s) cell tower, prompting mobile phones and other wireless devices to communicate with the simulators instead of communicating with authentic cell towers. These devices are often called \u201cStingrays,\u201d the name of one such device produced by Harris Corporation, along with their AmberJack, BlackFin, KingFish, Gossamer, LoggerHead, and TriggerFish. They are also referred to by the names of Hailstorm, ArrowHead and DRT \u201cDirt\u201d Box. \r\n\r\nCell site simulators are commonly used in several ways: to collect unique numeric identifiers associated with each mobile phone in a given geographic area, to determine the precise location of the mobile phone when numbers associated with it are known but only a general idea of its location is known, or to intercept phone calls and SMS messages. \r\n\r\nEach of these uses raises privacy concerns, the most obvious of which is presented by the interception of voice and SMS communications. Collecting unique identifiers of all phones in a particular area inevitably collects location data on many innocent people who would be suspected of no crime. Determination of the precise location of a specific phone can reveal that the phone, and thus the person who operates it, is in a constitutionally-protected place, such as their private home for instance, which has been traditionally immune from search without judicial approval via search warrant. The locations of people\u2019s mobile phones reveal a variety of personal information, such as: with whom they associate, where they frequent, where they spend their days, where they spend their nights, when they are home alone, where they work and worship, as well as the identities, locations and relationship details and patterns of their family, friends, associates or even service providers, such as their healthcare providers. \r\n\r\nIt has been widely reported in recent years that law enforcement agencies use these devices while hiding their use from the public and from the courts. Despite widespread public interest in the use and misuse of cell site simulators, the community has no information about your agency\u2019s use of these devices or your agency\u2019s policies for using these devices. Information is necessary for the public to determine whether the use of cell site simulators by your agency complies with the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and with Missouri state law.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords regarding your agency\u2019s acquisition of cell site simulators, including but not limited to invoices, purchase orders, contracts, loan agreements, evaluation agreements, solicitation letters, correspondence with companies and public agencies that provide the devices, and similar documents. \r\n\r\n2.\tRecords regarding any offer, proposal, arrangement, agreement or memorandum of understanding with St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (\u201cSTLMPD\u201d), Missouri State Highway Patrol, St. Louis Fusion Center (\u201cSTLFC\u201d), Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), U.S. Marshals Service, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\u201cODNI\u201d), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), Homeland Security Information Network (\u201cHSIN\u201d), U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), FBI\u2019s Data Intercept Technology Unit (\u201cDITU\u201d), FBI\u2019s Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (\u201cN-DEx\u201d), Mid-State Organized Crime Information Center (\u201cMOCIC\u201d), Regional Information Sharing Systems Technology Support Center (RTSC), or any corporation, to borrow, permanently acquire from, or use any cell site simulator owned or possessed by STLMPD, Missouri State Highway Patrol, STLFC, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, ODNI, DHS, HSIN, DOJ, DITU, N-DEx, MOCIC, RTSC, or corporation. \r\n\r\n3.\tAll disclosure agreement documents with Harris Corporation, Digital Receiver Technology (DRT, formerly Utica Systems, now a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation), Septier Communication Limited, Proximus LLC, any other corporation and any state or federal agencies, regarding your agency\u2019s actual or potential possession or use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n4.\tRecords regarding policies and guidelines governing use of cell site simulators, including but not limited to 1) when, where, how, and against whom the devices may be used to target, 2) logging retention, purging, use and auditing data stored in or communicated from the devices, 3) under what circumstances administrative warrant, judicial warrant, or other legal process must, should or should not be obtained prior to during, or following direct or indirect use of the devices, 4) under what circumstances the existence or use of the devices must, should, or should not be revealed to judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, criminal defendants, or the general public., and 5) parallel construction techniques for use in avoidance of disclosure of the initial method of discovery of information gained initially by use of cell site simulators \r\n\r\n5.\tDocuments pertaining to training, including training materials and records that verify and document training for use of cell site simulators. Including protocol and procedure regarding collection, retention, dissemination of and disposition of citizen\u2019s private cell phone data    \r\n\r\n6.\tRecords regarding any communication or agreements with wireless service providers (i.e., mobile phone carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile/Sprint, Boost Mobile, MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile, Mint Mobile, Straight Talk, Spectrum, Consumer Cellular, etc.) concerning use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n7.\tRecords regarding any communications, licenses, waivers, or agreements, with federal or state communication regulatory agencies (e.g., Federal Communication Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Missouri Public Service Commission, National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, National Regulatory Research Institute, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, etc.) concerning use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n8.\tRecords reflecting the number of investigations in which cell site simulators were used, the number of those investigations that resulted in prosecutions, and the number of those investigations that resulted in convictions for the period of January 1, 2020 to the date of this request \r\n\r\n9.\tRecords reflecting a list of all criminal cases, with docket numbers if available, in which law enforcement officers or other staff used or arranged for the use of one or more cell site simulators as part of the underlying investigations for the period of January 1, 2020 to the date of this request\r\n\r\n10.\tAll applications submitted to state or federal courts for warrants, orders, or other authorization for use of cell site simulators in criminal investigations, as well as any warrants, orders, authorizations, denials of warrants, denials of warrants, denials of orders, denials of authorization, or returns of warrants associated with those applications for the period of January 1, 2020 to the date of this request\r\n\r\n11.\tRecords regarding the use of cell site simulators in closed investigations\r\n\r\n12.\tDate and docket number of any responsive records that are sealed\r\n\r\n13.\tAll associated records of metadata regarding the use of cell site simulators \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as this request is in the public\u2019s interest. \r\n\r\nIn addition to an email response, I request a copy to be sent through U.S. postal mail service as confirmation and an official record that cannot be modified or deleted. I will also be emailing and corresponding using the U.S. postal service to follow up with any additional responses regarding my request.  Please use the following address:\r\n\r\nMuckRock Mailing Address:\r\n1 City Hall Square, \r\nRoom 603\r\nBoston, MA 02108\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll United States Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) records for Thomas Edward Southerland (March 17, 1941 \u2013 January 11, 2020), aka Thomas E. Southerland and Thomas E. Sutherland, and Leslie Atkinson (November 19, 1925 - November 11, 2014), aka Leslie Ike Atkinson and Ike Atkinson. Mr. Southerland and Mr. Atkinson were apprehended on December 11, 1972, at Andrews Air Force Base (now Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington), in Prince George's County, Maryland. At that time, agents working for the United States Customs Service inspected the bodies of two deceased Army personnel in connection with information that Mr. Southerland and Mr. Atkinson were smuggling narcotics into the United States using the bodies for transport. Per files released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FOI/PA # 1481062), the FBI, Customs, and CID jointly participated in a task force to investigate this claim.\r\n\r\nMr. Southerland\u2019s death was reported in the January 12, 2020 edition of The News and Observer, based out of Raleigh, North Carolina. I am providing a clipping taken from Legacy.com of his obituary, as an attachment. You may also find his obituary online at: https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/thomas-southerland-obituary?pid=195009022\r\n\r\nMr. Atkinson's death was reported in the November 13, 2014 edition of The News and Observer, based out of Raleigh, North Carolina. I am providing a clipping taken from Legacy.com of his obituary, as an attachment. You may also find his obituary online at: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newsobserver/name/leslie-atkinson-obituary?id=35755792\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and Philly Voice, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver would be justified in this case because of the nature of the offense. Currently, there are urban legends that still exist around the trafficking of narcotics in the bodies of dead soldiers, based on the initial reporting of this case in particular. The Washington Post, for example, published an article on December 17, 1972, titled \"Heroin Smuggled in Soldiers' Caskets\", about Mr. Southerland and Mr. Atkinson. Any records CID may possess would contribute to public understanding on the subject. Additionally, as noted, the FBI has already released FOI/PA records on their portion of the investigation.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
