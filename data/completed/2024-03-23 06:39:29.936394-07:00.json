County where the local government is located\r\n4. Election date\r\n5. Result of election (votes for, votes against, pass/fail)\r\n6.

In addition, it contains only information on elections dating back to 1986, while I request data for elections dating back to 1972.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Good afternoon, Mr Gregg,\r\nFor your (and others') convenience, the Board has already uploaded our current precincts' shapefile to the \"Chicago Data Portal\" (https://data.cityofchicago.org/ ). Since they carry a number of  such files, one fairly easy way to find the file - using their search bar - is to \r\n1. search for \"precincts\", then \r\n2. scroll through the resulting list to \"Boundaries - Ward Precincts (2023- )\"\r\nYou'll probably find two entries, a \"Map\" view which will show you precincts, and another \"DataSet\" version with a slightly more direct button to the download - although you can reach the same dataset via the map view as well.  \r\nThis precinct map, with 1291 precincts, covers not only this election but the two Municipal Elections (Feb General and April Runoff) in 2023.  In fact, it's nearly the same for the Nov 2022 General (which had 1290 precincts - the first election which we administered using the \"2022 Wards\", derived and approved from the 2020 Census ReDistricting).  Between Nov 2022 and Feb 2023, one precinct - Ward 24 pct 16 - was split in two, subsequently becoming precincts 16 and 20.  Merge Wd 24, pcts 16 & 20 in this file, and it should describe the Nov 2022 results as well .  Previous elections (including the 2022 spring Primary ) used the Wards (and precincts) from the prior Census' redistricting.\r\n\r\nWe also have a number of Ward & Precinct maps, Legislative District maps, Lists of precincts within Legislative Districts, along with election results, etc, via our website \"chicagoelections.gov\",   Currently the March 19 primary results are still being counted, due to obligatory waiting periods for mail ballots, provisional ballots, etc. \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question.",

FIREARMS/HANDGUNS \u2013 Concealed weapon dissemination is statutorily prohibited and would violate the subject\u2019s right to privacy. This information would be exempt from disclosure.

KIDNAPPING \u2013 Please provide a name(s) of a current or former NSD Elementary School Principal or teacher who you believe was involved in a Kidnapping report. \r\n4.

DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL - Please provide a name(s) of a current or former NSD Elementary School Principal or teacher who you believe was involved in a DUI report. \r\n7.

COMPLAINTS - Please provide a name(s) of a current or former NSD Elementary School Principal or teacher who you believe was referenced in a complaint. I believe NSD would hold the records in regards to complaints on current or former NSD principals or teachers. Typically we only see complaints in regards to situations and/or specific officers  Please clarify what complaints you would like to receive. \r\n\r\nI can search the principal names provided in your request, but other than those names I have no way of knowing any other names of NSD current or former principals or teachers. In addition, it should be noted the two Principals involved recently in the news were NSD principals, but were not principals within the City of Bothell Police Department\u2019s jurisdiction.

See attached map of City of Bothell\u2019s jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nLastly, please provide a searchable date range. \r\nIf we do not hear from you with clarification by 2/26/2024, we will interpret your request as only searching the elementary schools within our jurisdiction for the names provided in your request within the last two years. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated records responsive to the foregoing interpretation will be ready by 3/4/2024. \r\nPlease feel free to contact me at 425-487-5126 or respond to this email with any questions. \r\nSincerely, \r\nJessica Ertel \r\nPublic Records Specialist, Police",

Dear Peter Fugiel, On behalf of the Office of the Mayor, I am responding to your Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request which was dated October 23, 2023 and received in our office on the same day. At this time, the Office of the Mayor\u00a0is seeking an extension of five additional working days to respond to the requests for one or more of the following reasons identified in 5 ILCS 140/3(e) of FOIA: (xx\u00a0 ) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records; (\u00a0 ) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; (\u00a0 ) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it; (\u00a0 ) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; (\u00a0 ) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of the FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions; (\u00a0 ) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by 5 ILCS 140/3(d) without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body; (\u00a0 ) there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\n \r\nDear Mr. Fugiel, \r\nI am writing to address your FOIA request F059395-102323. \r\nAs an initial matter, can you please upload your list of email addresses as a word file, or copy-paste them into the body of an email? I have downloaded the pdf and converted it to readable text but it did not transcribe properly; in its current form I am not able to search for the records specified using those email addresses. \r\nAdditionally, I wanted to notify you that this office can only produce records from the Mayor's Office. Illinois FOIA contemplates that each distinct organization within a city\u2019s government is its own \u201cpublic body\u201d: \"Public body\" means all legislative, executive, administrative, or advisory bodies of the State, state universities and colleges, counties, townships, cities, villages, incorporated towns, school districts and all other municipal corporations, boards, bureaus, committees, or commissions of this State, any subsidiary bodies of any of the foregoing including but not limited to committees and subcommittees thereof, and a School Finance Authority created under Article 1E of the School Code. Accordingly, courts have held that the City of Chicago complied with FOIA by having each department maintain a central office file containing that department\u2019s records, expressly rejecting the contention that FOIA obligates the City to maintain a \u201csingle central office file.\u201d Duncan Pub., Inc. v. City of Chicago , 304 Ill. App. 3d 778, 784 (1999). \u201cClearly, each of the individual departments are subsidiary bodies of the City and are \u2018public bodies\u2019 as defined by the FOIA. Id., see Board of Regents of the Regency University System v. Reynard, 292 Ill.App.3d 968, 978 (1997).  As such, the executive and administrative departments and offices that comprise the government of the City of Chicago each have their own FOIA officers responsible for producing the records within their department or office\u2019s maintenance or control. To this end, a FOIA request made to the Mayor\u2019s Office only obligates the production of responsive Mayor\u2019s Office records. Thank you, Olivia R. Henry Acting FOIA Officer Mayor's Office 312-742-0116",

You requested: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll emails and attachments sent or received during the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019 by Aldermen John Arena, Patrick O'Connor, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Susan Sadlowski-Garza, or Tom Tunney that contain the (non-case-sensitive) phrases \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\", or \"fair scheduling.\" I have attached a list of 29 email addresses pertinent to this request, including aliases and Ward addresses. Please search for responsive records associated with any of these 29 addresses. \r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer that the request be filled electronically, if possible, by e-mail attachment. \r\n\r\nNote that, in order to obtain all responsive records regardless of which public body holds them, I am submitting this request concurrently to the Chicago City Council; City Clerk; Mayor's Office; and Department of Assets, Information, and Services. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel \r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow \r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/peter.fugiel/127815/Aldermanic_addresses_to_search.xlsx \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmayors-office-885%252Fselect-aldermanic-fair-workweek-emails-mayors-office-153499%252F%253Femail%253DMOfoia%252540cityofchicago.org&url_auth_token=AAAVavwDwG8GPyXRjVmZ6s1rPx8%3A1quocZ%3AbUNXKFNYoMtWTUQnGKdOQi7IKDfV6YJEmTFHfv0jlBs\" \r\nResponsive records are attached here and can be viewed and downloaded on the GovQA portal. \r\nPlease be advised the Department redacted portions of the responsive records in compliance with FOIA. Specifically, emails in the deliberative process where a specific decision was being reached, as well as draft policies and memoranda, were redacted/withheld. Section 7(1)(f) exempts from disclosure, \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). Because these records reflected opinions, recommendations, and drafts in the deliberative process, they were properly redacted under 7(1)(f). \r\nAdditional redactions were made for personally identifying and otherwise private data, including cell phone numbers, private email addresses, and private street addresses.\u00a0 These redactions are proper under Section 7(1)(b), which exempts from disclosure \u201cprivate information.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b). Private information is defined in Section 2(c-5) as: \r\nunique identifiers, including a person\u2019s social security number, driver\u2019s license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \r\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5). Therefore, these identifiers were properly redacted pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA. Section 7(1)(c) exempts from disclosure: \r\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[\u2026] \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. \r\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c). The Department properly redacted the previously mentioned identifiers pursuant to Section 7(1)(c). \r\nYou have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office. \r\nSincerely, \r\nOlivia R. Henry \r\nActing FOIA Officer \r\nMayor's Office",

I was surprised to find several emails addressed to the Mayor that were not previously released in response to my request (#F048062-060623) for emails received by the Mayor. This raises the question of whether your predecessor, Thomas Skelton, searched for Fair Workweek testimony sent to the Letterforthemayor@cityofchicago.org address.

Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/10/nyregion/donald-barr-82-headmaster-and-science-honors-educator.html. Records are likely to exist on Barr as he was nominated in 1983 to be part of the National Council on Educational Research, a now-defunct body of the Department of Education.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to Clayland Boyden Gray. Mr. Gray was a lawyer and diplomat who served as White House Counsel from 1989 to 1993 and as U.S. Ambassador to the European Union from 2006 to 2007. He was born on 6 February 1943 in Winston-Salem, NC, USA. He died on 21 May 2023.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in numerous national media, including the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/obituaries/c-boyden-gray-dead.html and the Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/05/21/c-boyden-gray-white-house-counsel-president-ghw-bush-dies-80/.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) President George Herbert Walker Bush, to whom the subject served as White House Counsel\r\n(2) Chief Justice Earl Warren, to whom the subject was a law clerk\r\n(3) The Atlantic Counsel, on whose board the subject served\r\n(4) The European Institute, on whose board the subject served\r\n(5) FreedomWorks, on whose board the subject served\r\n(6) The Federalist Society, of which the subject was a member\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray was a public figure. He served as White House Counsel to George H. W. Bush and was the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. News obituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other national media. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Given Mr. Gray's government service as a high-level advisor and employee in the executive and judicial branches, the public's understanding of Mr. Gray, his work, and the work of the government will likely be enhanced significantly.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just an inquisitive citizen. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this request.",

        "communication": "Dear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver for my FOIPA Request No. 1593177-000 .\r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2. My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of his death appearing in major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political scientists, scholars, the legal academy, and many others. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.\r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMackey O'Keefe",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Frank Paul Cali was also known as \"Francesco Paolo Augusto Cal\u00ec\" and \"Franky Boy.\" He was reported by DOJ as being arrested February 7, 2008. He was tried in United States v. Agate (1:08-cr-00076) District Court, Eastern District of New York.\r\n\r\nCali is widely reported to have died March 13, 2019 in Staten Island, NY (see attached article from the NY Times). Records concerning Cali as a subject should thus be assumed exempt from the FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all US Marshals Service systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies. \r\n\r\nUS Marshals Service systems of records of interest include (but are not limited to) the Internal Affairs System; U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Processing and Population Management-Prisoner Tracking System; Warrant Information Network (WIN); Witness Security Files Information System; and Inappropriate Communications-Threat Information System. \r\n\r\nPlease also search the DOJ-wide system of records, DOJ-005 Nationwide Joint Automated Booking System (JABS).\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that USMS has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

Upon information and belief, the agency is likely to have further records --for instance, a USM-312 (\"Personal History of Defendant\") record. As this was not provided, I believe the agency performed a perfunctory and inadequate search of only one class of record, that did not meet the requirement of \"a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents\" (see Truitt v. Department of State, 897 F. 2d 540 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1990). \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is that the agency remand this case with instructions to broaden its search to all forms and record types that would reasonbly apply to an individual such as Frank Paul Cali, a career criminal and high ranking member of organized crime.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nT.

Spector, a former Military Intelligence Officer from Syracuse, New York, who operated a Cadillac Dealership in Ogdensburg, NY in 1970.  Spector was born February 3, 1922 SSN: 578-20-6293, and died September 21, 1995 as reported in the September 23, 1995 Syracuse Herald-Journal, a copy of which I have attached to this request.  Spector had extensive dealings with the BNDD and the DEA from 1971 through 1976 and testified before Congress about matters involving the Agency.  In addition, I am interested in any and all files pertaining to Spector's dealings with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) before it became the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBruce McKenna\n\n",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \" unusual circumstances .\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a )( 6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0\u00a0Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Melanie M. Hoyos at (571) 776-3008 or via e-mail at Melanie.M.Hoyos@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov.

Copies of contracts into which the department has entered with Othram Inc. between Jan. 1 2018 and the time this request is processed.\r\n2. Copies of any proposals or presentations anyone representing Othram Inc. has presented to the department between Jan. 2018 and the time this request is processed; these may be identifiable by searching for records attached to anyone whose email address ends in @othram.com.\r\n3. Copies of any correspondence between any official in the department with the authority to review contract proposals or enter into contracts and anyone with an email address ending in @othram.com dated between Jan. 1 2018 and the time this request is processed. I also request that any documents attached to any discovered correspondence be provided in .pdf format.\r\n\r\nElectronic records should be produced in their unlocked native format with all original metadata and original filenames. Paper documents should be scanned and produced as Adobe PDF files. Emails produced should be grouped together with any attachments. When searching emails, please search all folders, including inbox, subject matter folders, sent items, archived items, and deleted items. Please produce all metadata fields for emails, including BCC and all others. Please email all records produced to kassidy.dillon@vice.com.\r\n\r\nThe above request is a matter of public interest.  The requested documents will be used in the course of reporting for VICE News. As such, we request a fee waiver. The disclosure of the information sought is not for commercial purposes; instead, it will contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of government operations. \r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the California Public Records Act. Please inform us of the reason(s) for such denial in writing, and provide the name, mailing address, and email address of the person or body to whom an appeal should be directed. I expect the release of all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. Please do not redact any non-responsive information from any records; we request the complete copies of any records with any responsive information. \r\n\r\nIn the interest of time, I request that you provide documents as they become available rather than waiting for the complete set.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nKassidy Dillon",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records responsive to Cobwebs Technologies and Tangles.\r\n\r\nTangles is identified in a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis titled \"Operations in Portland\". This was report was first issued on April 20, 2021 but a revised version was published by Senator Ron Wyden on his website on October 27, 2022 (https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/I&A%20and%20OGC%20Portland%20Reports.pdf). The revised report states on page 55 that Tangles is a \"social media aggregation tool\" that was used by DHS Open Source Collection Operations to compile information on individuals attending the 2020 George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon using \"available social media profiles.\"\r\n\r\nCobwebs Technologies has publicly acknowledged itself as the creator of Tangles on its website (https://cobwebs.com/using-web-intelligence-for-criminal-investigations/), which states Tangles is a \"web intelligence platform\" that can \"obtain precise and unrivaled web intelligence in the open and dark web in a fraction of the time it used to take.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting all responsive records including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Current and previous contracts with Cobwebs Technologies\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Initial Bid Documents\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Procurement Request Packages\r\n\r\n- Change Order Requests issued by either DHS or Cobwebs Technologies\r\n\r\n- Privacy impact assessments for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Product manuals for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Instructional materials or presentations by Cobwebs Technologies and/or for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Use policies and standard operating procedures for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Data retention policies for Tangles\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing the neo-nazi website titled White Honor,\r\n    hosted at WhiteHonor.com, including but not limited to references located in\r\n    cross references such as 266N-NK-116993 or records relating either of the\r\n    cyber incidents described in the attachments.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
