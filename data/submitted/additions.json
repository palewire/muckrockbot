The article also notes that Army Reserve's 1st Mission Support Command supported training and that Col. Carlos Caceres,  commander of the 1st Mission Support Command, \"brought in all his local contacts with the state police, Army Reserve, National Guard, FBI. He invited whoever was out there to come meet with us to discuss our event.\u201d The article says \"approximately 200 personnel participated.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) All instructional materials, presentations and presentation materials related to and used during  Vigilant Defender 23. This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed Vigilant Defender 23, B) any notes taken during meetings that took place during Vigilant Defender 23 training, and C) any other documents related to Vigilant Defender 23, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any messages, emails, and associated attachments shared with local, state, and federal agencies to promote \"situational awareness\" of the Vigilant Defender 23 military training and the presence of counterintelligence agents in Puerto Rico.
