Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nWith respect to requests for records that include \"Writings\" per 42.56.010(4) this means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically includes - and the District is specifically directed to obtain, preserve in native format, and produce - any records pertaining to public business that exist on any computers, hard drives, portable phones, jump drives, BlackBerries, iPhone, Kindle, IPad, or other devices, or in email, data, voice mail, or text mail accounts owned, controlled or paid for, directly or indirectly, by any agency or 3rd party. \r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide the records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request  a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon (NOTE: please refer to this number in all correspondence regarding your request)\r\nDear Anonymous requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I acknowledge receipt of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITINGS \u2013 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL), ELECTRONIC TEXTS, TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES, AND TELEPHONE LOGS of the following individuals for the period of time between January 1, 2019 \u2013 November 2, 2021:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafa\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nClarification Questions:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your request seeks communications \u201cof\u201d the above -named individuals. Please define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals. Are you also seeking records \u201cto\u201d the above-named persons? Are you seeking communications on which the above persons were cc\u2019d?\r\n  2.  I assume you intended to refer to School Board Member Sima Sarrafan. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n  3.  It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

When you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cfrom\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cto\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201ccopied to\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nTo give you a sense of the volume of records you have requested, searches of potentially responsive records for the following persons for the first six-month period, 05 01 21 through 11 02 21, returned the following numbers of potentially responsive messages to be reviewed and processed for production to you:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran                                                                   8420\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis                                                                      7245\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas              25,244\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn     13.443\r\nTotal for these 4 individuals, 05 01 21-11 02 21:                                  53,952\r\n\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 01 21-10 14 21. This is roughly the first half of the month of October 2021, consisting of 446 messages. The period 10 15 21-11 02 21 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records. Please click the link below to retrieve the following records:\r\nNOTE: I am having technical difficulties creating this link. I will complete this process as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 15 21 through 10 21 2021. It includes 227 messages. The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The reports cite several critical errors and document interviews with staff before and after inspections, which ultimately led to the relicensing of the facility at the end of 2022.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",

As such the review was on hold pending responses from those offices. This week, I was able to get a response from both agencies and can now move forward with my review.

        "communication": "PRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nIn this message, on behalf of the Bellevue School District, I am completing the District's initial response to your request, making a first installment of responsive records, and posing some clarification questions to you.\r\nI understand your request, received April 26, 2021, to be:\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clarify, if the District is in possession of any digital recordings of Zoom meeting calls, Skype Sessions, Google Duo calls, Slack, Gotomeeting, etc. (any recorded internet-based video communication/presentation/instruction product) for the period of time 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 I am requesting a digital copy to be produced via internet web link.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should include all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by the District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should also include a search of all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by District employees if the digital video was recorded on equipment provided to the employee by the District, or if the digital video recording contains content relating to District agency related matters.\r\n\r\nI request the digital video files to be delivered unedited whenever possible and in the original format in which the files were digitally recorded and stored.\r\n\r\nYour request is potentially exceedingly voluminous and will be completed in a series of installments. This message contains the first installment, addressing recorded \"school board meetings\" and \"classroom sessions.\"\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to video recordings of school board meetings\r\nVideos of school board meetings are posted on the District's website. You may retrieve them as follows:\r\nGo to https://bsd405.org/about/school-board/. Scroll down and select \"Go to BoardDocs.\"  In BoardDocs, select \"Meetings\" from the ribbon at top right. On the left, use the dropdown menu to select the date of meeting in which you have an interest. When you select the date of any Regular Meeting of the Board of Directors, an icon labelled \"Watch video\" will appear. In most cases, these video recordings contain audio content only. Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \"View the Agenda\" icon.\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present or referred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without adult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall meetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted:\r\nDistrict website: https://bsd405.org/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bsd405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbsd405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587929667%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=8kzBso1VJsyXO5FMpes0bPoT7Kdu%2B4k5PyDGD0Cq13M%3D&reserved=0>\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheBSD405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTheBSD405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Nt4p%2BP29zz7Vyudzs4v8wAhoH9z3z7sgp4ZOyldfoG8%3D&reserved=0>\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bellevueschools405/<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbellevueschools405%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=UcBzaQQeyD%2BVRW2NvoEvSntMLFsa89obn403NAkwVF0%3D&reserved=0>\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings you have identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \"town halls.\"  Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n  2.  Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained.  Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale.  Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  3.  Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the  technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  4.  Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your request will be closed.\r\n\r\nPlease answer these clarification questions within 30 days, that is, on or before June 2, 2021. The District's analysis and assessment of your request may result in additional clarification questions.\r\nIf additional materials are identified that can be disclosed to you, subject to the issues expressed in the clarification questions above, I estimate July 15 as a tentative next installment date. However, that estimate may have to be altered, depending on your answers to the clarification questions above.\r\nI am glad to assist you if you wish to discuss.\r\nFinally, it is possible that there may be a delay in our communications due to firewalls in the District's email system that flag emails that appear to be spam or solicitations. In my experience, that can be remedied by the identification of a named sender. Please consider providing a named sender (in some way that will protect your anonymity, if you still wish to preserve it) if that appears to be a problem (e.g., in why you apparently thought the District received your request on April 22, when in fact it was received on April 25, a weekend day, and was deemed received on April 26).\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org\r\n\r\nMay 6, 2021\r\n\r\nRE: 1st installment, addressing recorded \"school board meetings\" and \"classroom sessions.\"\r\n\r\nHello Ms. Boyer,\r\n\r\nPlease see my responses to your 1st installment and answers to your requests for clarification:\r\n\r\nWith respect to video recordings of school board meetings\r\n\r\nVideos of school board meetings are posted on the District's website. You may retrieve them as follows:\r\nGo to https://bsd405.org/about/school-board/. Scroll down and select \"Go to BoardDocs.\" In BoardDocs, select \"Meetings\" from the ribbon at top right. On the left, use the dropdown menu to select the date of meeting in which you have an interest. When you select the date of any Regular Meeting of the Board of Directors, an icon labelled \"Watch video\" will appear. In most cases, these video recordings contain audio content only. Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \u201cView the Agenda\u201d icon.\r\n\r\nResponse: Thank you.\r\n\r\nWith respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\n\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present orreferred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights \tand Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without \tadult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, while digital video recordings where students are present or referred to certainly could be wholly exempt from disclosure to third parties, this is certainly not always going to be the case. Public records act exemptions are subject to very specific State and Federal statutes and circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe request for copies of any digital video recordings of classroom sessions for the requested period of time is not necessarily exempt in whole. The District has the responsibility to search for digital video recordings of classroom sessions and then redact student information where appropriate under statute, then producing the remainder of the non-exempt record or in this matter digital video file.\r\n\r\nQuite probably digital video recordings wholly or partially redacted by the District based on specific exemptions would still provide the requestor the name of the video file, the date and time of the recording, the length of the recording, the place of recording, the method of recording, the storage location of the digital video file itself, metadata not subject to redaction, and more. \r\n\r\nFrom the BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 Public Records Request Website:\r\n\r\nhttps://bsd405.org/departments/records/public-records/\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the record requested for inspection and/or copying contains both information exempted from disclosure and nonexempt information, the District will produce as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portion redacted, and will provide a written explanation for the redaction.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease search for and provide digital video recordings of classroom sessions and redact where appropriate.\r\n \r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\n\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall \tmeetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted Facebook, Twitter, \tand Instagram <links omitted>\r\n\r\nResponse:  Thank you.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings \tyou \thave identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \t\"town \thalls.\" Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n1. Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n\r\nAgain, please refer to my response regarding the production of digital video recordings of classroom sessions and Bellevue School District policy regarding providing as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portions redacted, and then providing a written explanation for any redactions.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all digital video recordings for the time period specified.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n2. Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained. Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction \tprocess may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not \thave the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive \tscale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the District has chosen not to centrally maintain digital video recordings subject to public record requests. It may be prudent for the District to draft policy (should no policy currently be in place) governing the approximately 2,500 District employees who are directed or may choose to produce digital video recordings subject to public records requests.\r\n\r\nAs you know under the Public Records Act, agencies cannot charge for the time staff time spend locating a public record or making it available for inspection (including any time spent reviewing or redacting records).\r\nThe Bellevue School Board found that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome to calculate the actual costs of providing copies of public records, given the multiple electronic and manual devices used to do so, as well as the fluctuating costs of District supplies, equipment, and labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the District adopted the \u201cStatutory default cost\u201d option for calculating fees:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe District has determined it will not calculate actual costs for copying records for the reasons \tset forth in Policy 4040. The District will apply the fees and costs as authorized in RCW 42.56.120 \tand as published in the agency's fee schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fees for production of digital video recordings under the statutory default cost option are as follows:\r\n\r\nElectronic Documents: $0.05 per every four electronic files and/or email.\r\nTransmission of electronic records: $0.10 per gigabyte.\r\n\r\nA 1 Hour time length digital video recording of a ZOOM online video meeting results in a digital video file of approximately 1.2 gigabytes in size. Using these approximate calculations (4) 1-hour digital video recordings (1.2 Gb in size) produced by the district would generate fees of (4 files) x (.05) x (.10) = .60 or 60 cents. The fees may be marginally higher should the District choose to produce the requested files on CD-ROM. The District may charge the requestor for the cost of the CD-ROM itself as well as any postage. \r\n\r\nIf in the regular course of agency business the District and it\u2019s approximately 2,500 public employees have the technological capability to record and store digital videos on publicly owned computers and devices, the District certainly has the staff and technological ability to produce these digital videos subject to the Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question \u201cPlease clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request\u201d I do continue to seek such records. I have specified the records requested for a specific time period in my original public records request.\r\n\r\nFor efficiencies sake I would suggest the District designate a central digital repository on District computer servers to store all digital video files subject to public record requests and then to instruct all District employees to upload any digital video recordings for the requested time period to the designated central digital repository for review and production under the PRA. \r\n\r\nOf course recording, storing, and digitally transmitting digital video files is not technologically complicated and also comprises a regular function of various District employees on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n3. Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nCopyright is subject to certain limited exemptions and the District should redact accordingly. I do continue to seek these records. Please see my earlier responses.\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your \trequest will be closed.\r\n\r\nResponse regarding your commercial purpose inquiry and declaration:\r\n\r\nThe PRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). Digital video recordings by their very nature do not contain an electronic record that can be sorted as could an Excel spreadsheet or Word document. I renew my declaration contained in my original public records request:  I am not seeking a list of any kind, nor a list of individuals or businesses.\r\n\r\nIn my original public records request I specifically declared the request was not being made for commercial purposes, a requirement of the Public Records Act. I incorporate by reference my original public records request and declaration dated 4-22-21:\r\n\r\n\u201cRequest for digital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 (Bellevue School District).\u201d\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response to your requests for clarification. \r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Please refer to the PRR number above in the subject line of your correspondence with the District.\r\nCosts\r\nYour response neglects to refer to the customized service charge provision at page 7 of the District\u2019s Procedure 4040P, https://bsd405.org/wp-content/pdf/policy/4040P.pdf.\r\nIn order to develop a centralized location for storage and access services for what may be thousands of hours of digital video recordings, and to acquire and/or develop the technology expertise to prepare that compiled data for production to you, when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the District for any other District purpose, the District would have to assess a customized service charge.\r\nPlease advise if you would like to amend your request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a customized service charge.\r\nAdditionally, the District\u2019s Procedure at pp 7-8 permits it to make an alternative fee arrangement with any requestor in response to a voluminous request.\r\nIt may be possible to discuss an arrangement, for example, by which you could partially reduce the cost of a customized service charge by inspecting the recorded videos in person and selecting those records of which you wish to obtain a copy. We could consider setting up an area in which you could inspect such recordings. You would not be permitted to take any kind of recording device into that area.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Commercial Purpose\r\nThere is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list must be in Excel or another sortable format to be subject to the commercial purpose declaration.

        "communication": "May 10, 2021\r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\n\r\nHello Ms. Boyer,\r\n\r\nPlease see my responses to your communication of 05-07-2021:\r\n\r\nThank you for that prompt response. Please refer to the PRR number above in the subject line\r\nof your correspondence with the District.\r\n\r\nCosts\r\nYour response neglects to refer to the customized service charge provision at page 7 of the\r\nDistrict\u2019s Procedure 4040P, https://bsd405.org/wp-content/pdf/policy/4040P.pdf.\r\n\r\nResponse: No customized service charge applies to this public records request.\r\n\r\nSee RCW 42.56.120 (3)(a)(i):\r\n\u201cA customized service charge may only be imposed if the agency estimates that the request would\r\nrequire the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations, or provide\r\ncustomized electronic access services when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the agency for other agency purposes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis public records request does not seek a data compilation, only digital video recordings.\r\n\r\nThis public records request does not require customized electronic access services not used by the\r\nDistrict for other District purposes.\r\n\r\nThis public records request is seeking copies of digital video recordings in the care, control, or\r\npossession of the District.\r\n\r\nThe District can produce these recordings without the need for special or extraordinary information\r\ntechnology personnel, hardware, or software.\r\n\r\nThe digital video recordings requested were not generated or created by specialized information\r\ntechnology personnel, and no special information technology is required to produce digital recordings in response to this request.\r\n\r\nThe District bears the burden of redacting public records (including digital video recordings) and cannot charge the records requestor for the time and cost of redaction.\r\n\r\nThe District can charge for the copy and transmission of these digital video recordings at the rates per\r\nfile and per GB transmitted as previously established.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop a centralized location for storage and access services for what may be\r\nthousands of hours of digital video recordings, and to acquire and/or develop the technology\r\nexpertise to prepare that compiled data for production to you, when such compilations and\r\ncustomized access services are not used by the District for any other District purpose, the\r\nDistrict would have to assess a customized service charge.\r\n\r\nResponse:  The District need not develop any centralized location for storage and access of digital video recordings. In my previous response to you I was simply making a suggestion as to how (in my personal opinion) the District could more efficiently process digital video recordings as public records. The District is under no obligation to create a central repository for digital video recordings and I am not requesting the District do so.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you would like to amend your request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a\r\ncustomized service charge.\r\n\r\nResponse: As I stated earlier, no customized service charge is warranted for this public records request for digital video recordings. If you feel I am mistaken, please explain as per RCW 42.56.120 (3)(b):\r\n\r\n1. Please explain why a customized service charge applies?\r\n2. Please provide a description of the specific expertise warranting the application of a customized\r\nservice charge.\r\n3. Please provide a reasonable estimate of the cost of the customized service charge.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the District\u2019s Procedure at pp 7-8 permits it to make an alternative fee\r\narrangement with any requestor in response to a voluminous request.\r\nIt may be possible to discuss an arrangement, for example, by which you could partially reduce\r\nthe cost of a customized service charge by inspecting the recorded videos in person and\r\nselecting those records of which you wish to obtain a copy. We could consider setting up an\r\narea in which you could inspect such recordings. You would not be permitted to take any kind\r\nof recording device into that area.\r\n\r\nResponse: No thank you.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Commercial Purpose\r\nThere is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list must be in Excel or another\r\nsortable format to be subject to the commercial purpose declaration. The names of\r\nparticipants in many digital recordings are in the form of lists. Please complete the\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration, which I have again attached for your reference, by June 2,\r\n2021.\r\n\r\nResponse: You are correct, nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) states a list must be in Excel or a sortable\r\nformat. I was only attempting to provide an example of what the courts and Washington State Statute\r\nhas defined as a \u201clist\u201d under RCW 42.56.070(8). In any event, the application of RCW 42.56.070(8)\r\nconcerns a public records request seeking a \u201clist\u201d of natural individuals.\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, the names of participants displayed in a digital video recording is not a \u201clist\u201d as\r\ndefined by RCW 42.56.070(8):\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust as an email or any other document also not a \u201clist,\u201d the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed in a digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR\r\nLIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any responsive videos files produced under the law.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

You cannot walk in off the street into a parent or student meeting with a teacher, or into a classroom of students.  Similarly, you are not entitled to the content of digital video calls with parents or students, or to the content of a remotely conducted  classroom.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your purposes.\r\n\r\nAs set forth in my message to you dated May 3, 2021, a next phase of records production would require disruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees, added storage capacity, extensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction, and review, analysis, and anticipated redaction of exempt material. This is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records. As I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\r\n\r\nIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you. The Declaration is due on or before June 2, 2021.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

However please note, the original public records request is for \u201cDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions\u2026\u201d The various links you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally requested. Also, the links do not provide information about what digital video files have been produced, and which have been withheld in their entirety, nor which digital video files have been edited and for what reason.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this public records request is seeking digital copies of specific digital media files, not links to stream partial content of the original files without a detailed exemption log explaining what has been withheld and why.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\r\n\u201cPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your \tpurposes.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\nHyperbole aside, no requested records (digital media files) have been produced. Links to 3rd party subscription based streaming media sites are not the records that have been requested.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\u201cThe District has advised you that where students are present or referred to in any video call \tor recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt. You cannot walk in off the\tstreet into a parent or student meeting with a teacher, or into a classroom of students. \tSimilarly, you are not entitled to the content of digital video calls with parents or students, \tor to the content of a remotely conducted classroom.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, any recorded digital video files (records) in the possession of the District where students are present or referenced are NOT FULLY EXEMPT. Rather these digital video files could potentially be partially exempt and some exemptions may be subject to redaction by the District. Any such exemptions applied are required to be recorded in an accompanying detailed exemption log for review by the requestor.\r\n\r\nExamples of what may not be fully exempt in any digital media file: the name of the digital media file, the type of file, the size of the file, various nonexempt portions of the file video content, the length of the recording, the date the file was created, and possibly much more.\r\n\r\nAll citizens are \u201centitled\u201d to review and/or copy public records in the District\u2019s care, custody, or control subject to redaction by the District based on valid legal exemptions. Exemptions which the District is required to detail in an exemption log provided to the requestor for review.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is the District\u2019s position that all digital video files in which a student is present or referenced are fully exempt and therefore will not be produced? \r\n\r\nQuestion: If in fact it is the District\u2019s position is that digital video files in which a student is present are fully exempt, is the District going to provide the required detailed exemption logs to the requestor, listing which digital video files are exempt and why?\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs set forth in my message to you dated May 3, 2021, a next phase of records production would require disruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees, added \tstorage capacity, extensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable \tformats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction, and review, analysis, and anticipated redaction of exempt material. This is likely to require the purchase of hardware \tand software that is not presently available to nor within the technical expertise of staff that \tresponds to public records. As I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of \tcustomized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There  may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be \tresponsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nThe District\u2019s responsibilities under the Public Records Act are clear. To address your comments point by point: \r\n\r\n\u201cdisruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease see WAC 44-14-04003(3) \u201cThe agency should recognize that fulfilling public records requests is one of the agency's duties, along with its others.\u201d These public employees created digital video files that are now public record. It is certainly not \u201cdisruptive\u201d for public employees to produce identifiable public records.\r\n\r\n\u201cadded storage capacity\u201d\r\n\r\nQuestion: Why the need for added storage capacity? Regardless, irrelevant under the Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\u201cextensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain, irrelevant. All costs of preparation for responsive documents and any redactions if required is the sole responsibility of the District. No costs for collation or redaction may be passed on to the original requestor under the act. See WAC 44-14-07001:\r\n\r\n\tWAC 44-14-07001 General rules for charging for copies.\r\n\t(1) No fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. An \tagency cannot charge a fee for locating public records or for preparing the records for \tinspection or copying. RCW 42.56.120.1 An agency cannot charge fees for a person to inspect or \taccess records on the agency's public internet web site. An agency cannot charge a fee for \taccess to or downloading records the agency routinely posts on its public internet web site prior \tto the receipt of a request unless the requestor has specifically requested that the agency \tprovide copies of such records through other means. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(e).\r\n\r\n\tAn agency cannot charge a \"redaction fee\" for the staff time necessary to prepare the records \tfor inspection, for the copying required to redact records before they are inspected, or an \tarchive fee for getting the records from off-site. Op. Att'y Gen. 6 (1991). These are the costs of \tmaking the records available for inspection or copying and cannot be charged to the requestor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available  to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records.\u201d\r\n\r\nUntrue  however if so, also irrelevant. As clearly stated, the District cannot assess fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. The District is in possession of public records in the form of digital media files. These public records have been identified and requested per the Public Records Act and the District is required to produce these records in compliance with the act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I requested previously, please provide a detailed accounting of the customized service charge the District believes applies to this public records request. I believe once the District produces a detailed record of any proposed customized service charge it will be simple to demonstrate the District is in error, and no customized service charge applies to this public records request under the PRA (RCW 42.56).\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I previously stated, no requested records have been produced by the District to date, and my previous request for the District to provide a detailed accounting of any proposed customized service charge is still outstanding. District staff vacations do not relieve the District of its responsibilities under the public records act. \r\n\r\nAdditionally the District should advise all employees, volunteers, contractors, and any other 3rd parties who may have care, custody, or control of any digital video files originally requested in PRR 04262021 to preserve these public records until this request is resolved. \r\n\r\nPlease consider WAC 44-14-04003(9) as constructive notice:\r\n\t\u201cWAC 44-14-04003(9) Preserving requested records. If a requested record is scheduled shortly \tfor destruction, and the agency receives a public records request for it, the record cannot be \tdestroyed until the request is resolved. RCW 42.56.100.8 Once a request has been closed, the \tagency can destroy the requested records in accordance with its retention schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\t\u201cAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you. The Declaration is due on or before June 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI previously addressed your multiple requests for a signed \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document. \r\n\r\nDigital video files are not a \u201clist\u201d as defined in RCW 42.56.070(8).\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed as a list in any digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is it the District\u2019s position that PRR 04262021 \u2013 this request for copies of digital video files will not proceed without the requestor signing the District\u2019s \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document?\r\n\r\nAt this point it certainly appears that the District is not applying a good faith interpretation of the statues governing public records, nor providing \u201cfullest assistance\" and \"most timely possible action\" (WAC 44-14-04003(3)) in processing PRR 04262021.\r\n\r\nThe District is constructively denying the processing of this public records request. I formally request an immediate denial review of PRR 04262021 by District legal counsel. If in a reasonable amount of time a denial review by the District does not provide the relief requested, I reserve the right under RCW 42.56.550 to seek Judicial review of the District\u2019s position in Superior Court.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

You state, \u201cThe various links you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally requested.\u201d That is not correct. You have been provided with access to hundreds of original digital video recordings that are responsive to your request.\r\nReferring a requestor by means of a link to an agency\u2019s publicly maintained webpage or website, on which requested records are or may be posted, is an appropriate manner in which to respond to a public records request.\r\nI do not understand your objection in this regard. If you need assistance retrieving the digital video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Commercial Purposes Declaration, you have pointed out that it contained a caption, \u201cRequest for List of Names.\u201d I offered to you the option of striking out that caption, and initialing your strikeout, if you believed the caption did not apply. To accommodate you further, I have attached a revised version of the Declaration in which that caption is removed. You may complete this version of the Declaration if you prefer. I will extend the due date for returning the Declaration, for your convenience, to June 8, 2021.\r\nAs you acknowledged on May 10, there is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list is defined as one in Excel or another sortable format. A request that seeks a list of individuals is subject to an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2). The names of participants in many digital recordings are shown within the recording. For that reason, it is appropriate for the District to conduct an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2).\r\n\r\nI have not represented that the District does not intend to produce additional records. To the contrary, I have appropriately informed you of the estimated timeframe for producing such records, and have explained the factors affecting that estimate.\r\nAs earlier noted, the District is evaluating a customized service charge.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\r\nConsideration of Petition for Review\r\nThe Public Records Officer shall promptly refer the petition to a District official designated to conduct the review, who will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the District\u2019s receipt of the petition, or within such other time to which the District and the requestor mutually agree.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to request an internal review, you may petition in writing under Procedure 4040P. \u201cThe petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\u201d\r\n\r\nYour request has not been denied. You have been provided access to hundreds of digital copies of video recordings as you requested. Also, you have been provided with an estimated date of September 23, 2021 for a third installment.\r\n\r\nIf your request for a review under Procedure 4040P is intended to address the question of the District\u2019s inquiry as to a commercial purpose under RCW 42.56.080(2), please identify that issue in the petition.\r\nIt is the District\u2019s position that it has the right and statutory obligation under RCW 42.56.080(2) to conduct such an inquiry with respect to your request. The Declaration forms you have been provided explain the statutory basis for this obligation. Until you submit a completed and signed Commercial Purposes Declaration, and the District has completed its inquiry, the District will not be able to proceed to process additional potentially responsive recordings. The reason for this is that additional potentially responsive recordings may contain auditory and/or visual lists of individuals. In order to properly respond further to your request, and to avoid duplicative review and processing, the District needs to complete its inquiry as to whether your request has a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nPlease advise whether you will complete the Commercial Purposes Declaration provided to you earlier today, as revised (attached), by the extended deadline of June 8, 2021.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

If you need assistance retrieving the digital \r\n video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\u201d \r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nYou provided links to STREAM or VIEW digital videos online. I have requested COPIES of the digital video \r\nmedia files themselves. The links you have sent to not provide a digital copy of the original video, which \r\nis what was originally requested. \r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia on the nature of Streaming Media: \r\n\r\n Streaming media is multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner \r\n from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. Streaming refers to \r\n the delivery method of content, rather than the content itself. \r\n\r\n Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the \r\n entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. \r\n\r\nThe links you provided to STREAM the digital video files all stream videos that appear to have been \r\nedited. What content has been edited from the original videos? What are the file names of each digital \r\nvideo file? When was each digital file created? In what format was each digital video file stored? Why \r\nhave you not provided exemption logs explaining what content was redacted or edited from each digital \r\nmedia file and why? Which digital video files have been withheld in their entirety and why? \r\n\r\nYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited. You are \r\ncorrect in that if I had requested to \u201cview\u201d various digital video streams, the District providing a link to \r\npublicly maintained websites to \u201cview\u201d the content of the videos would most likely satisfy such a \r\nrequest. Links to stream video files do not satisfy this public records request. \r\n\r\nThis request is and always has been for DIGITAL COPIES of the ORIGINAL DIGITAL MEDIA VIDEO FILES \r\nthemselves. Preferably unedited and unredacted except were allowed by law, each file produced in its \r\noriginal native digital media format. Delivered to the requestor via internet link or in the alternative on \r\ndata CD-ROM. \r\n\r\nIf in fact the links you have provided can provide an original copy of the original digital media video files \r\nrequested in original native digital format unedited, with the original dates of creation and file names \r\nattached, then yes I do require assistance. I am unaware as to how to receive original unedited digital \r\nvideo files from YouTube and Facebook Links.  \r\n\r\nPlease see this partial YOUTUBE Terms of Service Agreement: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms \r\n\r\n \u201c\u2026Permissions and Restrictions \r\n You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with \r\n this Agreement and applicable law.

To accommodate you \r\n further, I have attached a revised version of the Declaration in which that caption is removed. \r\n You may complete this version of the Declaration if you prefer.

This statement is a violation of the Public Records Act: \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 \r\n\r\n Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n (2) Public records shall be available for inspection and copying, and agencies shall, upon \r\n request for identifiable public records, make them promptly available to any person including, \r\n if applicable, on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of \r\n requested records are assembled or made ready for inspection or disclosure. Agencies shall \r\n not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is \r\n overbroad. Agencies shall not distinguish among persons requesting records, and such persons \r\n shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request except to \r\n establish whether inspection and copying would violate RCW 42.56.070(8) or 42.56.240(14), or \r\n other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to \r\n certain persons. \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.070(8) \r\n\r\n This chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the \r\n secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, \r\n sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, \r\n the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of \r\n representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, \r\n HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall \r\n be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized \r\n by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge \r\n therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause \r\n pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative \r\n procedure act. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) does not apply. Digital video files are not \u201clists of individuals requested for \r\ncommercial purposes.\u201d \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.240(14): \r\n\r\n Body worn camera recordings to the extent nondisclosure is essential for the protection of \r\n any person's right to privacy as described in RCW 42.56.050, including, but not limited to, the \r\n circumstances enumerated in (a) of this subsection. A law enforcement or corrections agency \r\n shall not disclose a body worn camera recording to the extent the recording is exempt under \r\n this subsection. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.240(14) does not apply. The District is not a law enforcement agency. No body worn camera \r\nvideos have been identified to date in this records request. \r\n\r\nYOU STATED: \r\n\r\n \u201cIf the District has not received a completed declaration within thirty (30) days of today\u2019s \r\n date, your request will be closed.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis District lacks the statutory authority to close this public records request without due process. Please \r\nadvise if the District has closed this records request.

I intend to assist you promptly if it is your intention to proceed in that regard. Please advise if you intend to proceed with an internal review. If so, please identify precisely the issues you wish to have reviewed by submitting a petition as described in Procedure 4040P.  I will be able to refer a petition for an internal review upon receipt of a petition.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that videos posted on the sites I have provided to you can be downloaded.

I am not aware of editing that may have been done in any of the posted videos, or how you may have formed such an opinion by viewing them. My understanding is that the posted videos are original, final records. Board of director meeting videos, for example, would not have been edited prior to being posted on BoardDocs and the District\u2019s YouTube Channel.\r\n\r\nIf in a particular case there may have been an earlier version of a posted video, it is possible that the creator may have a draft of the video, which may be exempt under RCW 42.56.280, or which may have been in the form of an informal note and not a public record.\r\n\r\nYou also inquire about the name and date of videos, and their format.

Dates of creation may be additionally stated within a video, if a video was created before it was posted. The records speak for themselves as to these questions.\r\n\r\nAs I have explained, by providing you the hundreds of videos you have been provided to date, the District is not concluding your request. Rather, the District has promptly provided to you the readily available records that exist. The District is not asserting exemptions in the videos you have been provided. The process of assembling additional videos created and maintained by individual staff persons is an enormous and lengthy task, for the reasons I have described to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that it is part of the District\u2019s recordkeeping system that your PRR request number appear at the beginning of the subject line of emails pertaining to your request.

This message contains the first installment, addressing recorded \"school board meetings\" and \"classroom sessions.\"\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to video recordings of school board meetings\r\nVideos of school board meetings are posted on the District's website. You may retrieve them as follows:\r\nGo to https://bsd405.org/about/school-board/. Scroll down and select \"Go to BoardDocs.\"  In BoardDocs, select \"Meetings\" from the ribbon at top right. On the left, use the dropdown menu to select the date of meeting in which you have an interest. When you select the date of any Regular Meeting of the Board of Directors, an icon labelled \"Watch video\" will appear. In most cases, these video recordings contain audio content only. Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \"View the Agenda\" icon.\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present or referred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without adult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall meetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted:\r\nDistrict website: https://bsd405.org/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bsd405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbsd405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587929667%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=8kzBso1VJsyXO5FMpes0bPoT7Kdu%2B4k5PyDGD0Cq13M%3D&reserved=0>\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheBSD405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTheBSD405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Nt4p%2BP29zz7Vyudzs4v8wAhoH9z3z7sgp4ZOyldfoG8%3D&reserved=0>\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bellevueschools405/<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbellevueschools405%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=UcBzaQQeyD%2BVRW2NvoEvSntMLFsa89obn403NAkwVF0%3D&reserved=0>\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings you have identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \"town halls.\"  Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n  2.  Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained.  Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale.  Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  3.  Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the  technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  4.  Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your request will be closed.\r\n\r\nPlease answer these clarification questions within 30 days, that is, on or before June 2, 2021. The District's analysis and assessment of your request may result in additional clarification questions.\r\nIf additional materials are identified that can be disclosed to you, subject to the issues expressed in the clarification questions above, I estimate July 15 as a tentative next installment date. However, that estimate may have to be altered, depending on your answers to the clarification questions above.\r\nI am glad to assist you if you wish to discuss.\r\nFinally, it is possible that there may be a delay in our communications due to firewalls in the District's email system that flag emails that appear to be spam or solicitations. In my experience, that can be remedied by the identification of a named sender. Please consider providing a named sender (in some way that will protect your anonymity, if you still wish to preserve it) if that appears to be a problem (e.g., in why you apparently thought the District received your request on April 22, when in fact it was received on April 25, a weekend day, and was deemed received on April 26).\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \u201cView the Agenda\u201d icon.\r\n\r\nResponse: Thank you.\r\n\r\nWith respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\n\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present orreferred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights \tand Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without \tadult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, while digital video recordings where students are present or referred to certainly could be wholly exempt from disclosure to third parties, this is certainly not always going to be the case. Public records act exemptions are subject to very specific State and Federal statutes and circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe request for copies of any digital video recordings of classroom sessions for the requested period of time is not necessarily exempt in whole. The District has the responsibility to search for digital video recordings of classroom sessions and then redact student information where appropriate under statute, then producing the remainder of the non-exempt record or in this matter digital video file.\r\n\r\nQuite probably digital video recordings wholly or partially redacted by the District based on specific exemptions would still provide the requestor the name of the video file, the date and time of the recording, the length of the recording, the place of recording, the method of recording, the storage location of the digital video file itself, metadata not subject to redaction, and more. \r\n\r\nFrom the BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 Public Records Request Website:\r\n\r\nhttps://bsd405.org/departments/records/public-records/\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the record requested for inspection and/or copying contains both information exempted from disclosure and nonexempt information, the District will produce as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portion redacted, and will provide a written explanation for the redaction.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease search for and provide digital video recordings of classroom sessions and redact where appropriate.\r\n \r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\n\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall \tmeetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted Facebook, Twitter, \tand Instagram <links omitted>\r\n\r\nResponse:  Thank you.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings \tyou \thave identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \t\"town \thalls.\" Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n1. Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n\r\nAgain, please refer to my response regarding the production of digital video recordings of classroom sessions and Bellevue School District policy regarding providing as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portions redacted, and then providing a written explanation for any redactions.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all digital video recordings for the time period specified.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n2. Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained. Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction \tprocess may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not \thave the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive \tscale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the District has chosen not to centrally maintain digital video recordings subject to public record requests. It may be prudent for the District to draft policy (should no policy currently be in place) governing the approximately 2,500 District employees who are directed or may choose to produce digital video recordings subject to public records requests.\r\n\r\nAs you know under the Public Records Act, agencies cannot charge for the time staff time spend locating a public record or making it available for inspection (including any time spent reviewing or redacting records).\r\nThe Bellevue School Board found that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome to calculate the actual costs of providing copies of public records, given the multiple electronic and manual devices used to do so, as well as the fluctuating costs of District supplies, equipment, and labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the District adopted the \u201cStatutory default cost\u201d option for calculating fees:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe District has determined it will not calculate actual costs for copying records for the reasons \tset forth in Policy 4040. The District will apply the fees and costs as authorized in RCW 42.56.120 \tand as published in the agency's fee schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fees for production of digital video recordings under the statutory default cost option are as follows:\r\n\r\nElectronic Documents: $0.05 per every four electronic files and/or email.\r\nTransmission of electronic records: $0.10 per gigabyte.\r\n\r\nA 1 Hour time length digital video recording of a ZOOM online video meeting results in a digital video file of approximately 1.2 gigabytes in size. Using these approximate calculations (4) 1-hour digital video recordings (1.2 Gb in size) produced by the district would generate fees of (4 files) x (.05) x (.10) = .60 or 60 cents. The fees may be marginally higher should the District choose to produce the requested files on CD-ROM. The District may charge the requestor for the cost of the CD-ROM itself as well as any postage. \r\n\r\nIf in the regular course of agency business the District and it\u2019s approximately 2,500 public employees have the technological capability to record and store digital videos on publicly owned computers and devices, the District certainly has the staff and technological ability to produce these digital videos subject to the Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question \u201cPlease clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request\u201d I do continue to seek such records. I have specified the records requested for a specific time period in my original public records request.\r\n\r\nFor efficiencies sake I would suggest the District designate a central digital repository on District computer servers to store all digital video files subject to public record requests and then to instruct all District employees to upload any digital video recordings for the requested time period to the designated central digital repository for review and production under the PRA. \r\n\r\nOf course recording, storing, and digitally transmitting digital video files is not technologically complicated and also comprises a regular function of various District employees on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n3. Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nCopyright is subject to certain limited exemptions and the District should redact accordingly. I do continue to seek these records. Please see my earlier responses.\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your \trequest will be closed.\r\n\r\nResponse regarding your commercial purpose inquiry and declaration:\r\n\r\nThe PRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). Digital video recordings by their very nature do not contain an electronic record that can be sorted as could an Excel spreadsheet or Word document. I renew my declaration contained in my original public records request:  I am not seeking a list of any kind, nor a list of individuals or businesses.\r\n\r\nIn my original public records request I specifically declared the request was not being made for commercial purposes, a requirement of the Public Records Act. I incorporate by reference my original public records request and declaration dated 4-22-21:\r\n\r\n\u201cRequest for digital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 (Bellevue School District).\u201d\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response to your requests for clarification. \r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings.\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nFrom: Bellevue School District\r\n05/07/2021\r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nThank you for that prompt response.

In my previous response to you I was simply making a suggestion as to how (in my personal opinion) the District could more efficiently process digital video recordings as public records. The District is under no obligation to create a central repository for digital video recordings and I am not requesting the District do so.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you would like to amend your request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a\r\ncustomized service charge.\r\n\r\nResponse: As I stated earlier, no customized service charge is warranted for this public records request for digital video recordings.

Please complete the\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration, which I have again attached for your reference, by June 2,\r\n2021.\r\n\r\nResponse: You are correct, nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) states a list must be in Excel or a sortable\r\nformat. I was only attempting to provide an example of what the courts and Washington State Statute\r\nhas defined as a \u201clist\u201d under RCW 42.56.070(8). In any event, the application of RCW 42.56.070(8)\r\nconcerns a public records request seeking a \u201clist\u201d of natural individuals.\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, the names of participants displayed in a digital video recording is not a \u201clist\u201d as\r\ndefined by RCW 42.56.070(8):\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust as an email or any other document also not a \u201clist,\u201d the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed in a digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR\r\nLIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any responsive videos files produced under the law.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\nFrom: Muckrock Staff\r\n05/25/2021 \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI wanted to follow up on the following Washington Public Records Act request, copied below, and originally submitted on April 22, 2021.

You cannot walk in off the street into a parent or student meeting with a teacher, or into a classroom of students.  Similarly, you are not entitled to the content of digital video calls with parents or students, or to the content of a remotely conducted  classroom.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your purposes.\r\n\r\nAs set forth in my message to you dated May 3, 2021, a next phase of records production would require disruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees, added storage capacity, extensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction, and review, analysis, and anticipated redaction of exempt material. This is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records. As I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\r\n\r\nIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you.

Also, the links do not provide information about what digital video files have been produced, and which have been withheld in their entirety, nor which digital video files have been edited and for what reason.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this public records request is seeking digital copies of specific digital media files, not links to stream partial content of the original files without a detailed exemption log explaining what has been withheld and why.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\r\n\u201cPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your \tpurposes.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\nHyperbole aside, no requested records (digital media files) have been produced.

The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There  may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be \tresponsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nThe District\u2019s responsibilities under the Public Records Act are clear. To address your comments point by point: \r\n\r\n\u201cdisruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease see WAC 44-14-04003(3) \u201cThe agency should recognize that fulfilling public records requests is one of the agency's duties, along with its others.\u201d These public employees created digital video files that are now public record. It is certainly not \u201cdisruptive\u201d for public employees to produce identifiable public records.\r\n\r\n\u201cadded storage capacity\u201d\r\n\r\nQuestion: Why the need for added storage capacity? Regardless, irrelevant under the Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\u201cextensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain, irrelevant. All costs of preparation for responsive documents and any redactions if required is the sole responsibility of the District. No costs for collation or redaction may be passed on to the original requestor under the act. See WAC 44-14-07001:\r\n\r\n\tWAC 44-14-07001 General rules for charging for copies.\r\n\t(1) No fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. An \tagency cannot charge a fee for locating public records or for preparing the records for \tinspection or copying. RCW 42.56.120.1 An agency cannot charge fees for a person to inspect or \taccess records on the agency's public internet web site. An agency cannot charge a fee for \taccess to or downloading records the agency routinely posts on its public internet web site prior \tto the receipt of a request unless the requestor has specifically requested that the agency \tprovide copies of such records through other means. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(e).\r\n\r\n\tAn agency cannot charge a \"redaction fee\" for the staff time necessary to prepare the records \tfor inspection, for the copying required to redact records before they are inspected, or an \tarchive fee for getting the records from off-site. Op. Att'y Gen. 6 (1991). These are the costs of \tmaking the records available for inspection or copying and cannot be charged to the requestor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available  to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records.\u201d\r\n\r\nUntrue  however if so, also irrelevant. As clearly stated, the District cannot assess fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. The District is in possession of public records in the form of digital media files. These public records have been identified and requested per the Public Records Act and the District is required to produce these records in compliance with the act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I requested previously, please provide a detailed accounting of the customized service charge the District believes applies to this public records request. I believe once the District produces a detailed record of any proposed customized service charge it will be simple to demonstrate the District is in error, and no customized service charge applies to this public records request under the PRA (RCW 42.56).\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I previously stated, no requested records have been produced by the District to date, and my previous request for the District to provide a detailed accounting of any proposed customized service charge is still outstanding. District staff vacations do not relieve the District of its responsibilities under the public records act. \r\n\r\nAdditionally the District should advise all employees, volunteers, contractors, and any other 3rd parties who may have care, custody, or control of any digital video files originally requested in PRR 04262021 to preserve these public records until this request is resolved. \r\n\r\nPlease consider WAC 44-14-04003(9) as constructive notice:\r\n\t\u201cWAC 44-14-04003(9) Preserving requested records. If a requested record is scheduled shortly \tfor destruction, and the agency receives a public records request for it, the record cannot be \tdestroyed until the request is resolved. RCW 42.56.100.8 Once a request has been closed, the \tagency can destroy the requested records in accordance with its retention schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\t\u201cAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you. The Declaration is due on or before June 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI previously addressed your multiple requests for a signed \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document. \r\n\r\nDigital video files are not a \u201clist\u201d as defined in RCW 42.56.070(8).\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed as a list in any digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is it the District\u2019s position that PRR 04262021 \u2013 this request for copies of digital video files will not proceed without the requestor signing the District\u2019s \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document?\r\n\r\nAt this point it certainly appears that the District is not applying a good faith interpretation of the statues governing public records, nor providing \u201cfullest assistance\" and \"most timely possible action\" (WAC 44-14-04003(3)) in processing PRR 04262021.\r\n\r\nThe District is constructively denying the processing of this public records request. I formally request an immediate denial review of PRR 04262021 by District legal counsel. If in a reasonable amount of time a denial review by the District does not provide the relief requested, I reserve the right under RCW 42.56.550 to seek Judicial review of the District\u2019s position in Superior Court.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Bellevue School District\r\n06/01/2021\r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nOn May 29, you appear to object, for the first time, following the District\u2019s first installment to you dated May 3, 2021, and its second installment to you dated May 27, 2021, that you are not able to retrieve digital video recordings that you have requested, which are posted on the District\u2019s public sites at the links that have been provided to you. You state, \u201cThe various links you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally requested.\u201d That is not correct. You have been provided with access to hundreds of original digital video recordings that are responsive to your request.\r\nReferring a requestor by means of a link to an agency\u2019s publicly maintained webpage or website, on which requested records are or may be posted, is an appropriate manner in which to respond to a public records request.\r\nI do not understand your objection in this regard. If you need assistance retrieving the digital video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Commercial Purposes Declaration, you have pointed out that it contained a caption, \u201cRequest for List of Names.\u201d I offered to you the option of striking out that caption, and initialing your strikeout, if you believed the caption did not apply. To accommodate you further, I have attached a revised version of the Declaration in which that caption is removed. You may complete this version of the Declaration if you prefer. I will extend the due date for returning the Declaration, for your convenience, to June 8, 2021.\r\nAs you acknowledged on May 10, there is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list is defined as one in Excel or another sortable format. A request that seeks a list of individuals is subject to an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2). The names of participants in many digital recordings are shown within the recording. For that reason, it is appropriate for the District to conduct an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2).\r\n\r\nI have not represented that the District does not intend to produce additional records. To the contrary, I have appropriately informed you of the estimated timeframe for producing such records, and have explained the factors affecting that estimate.\r\nAs earlier noted, the District is evaluating a customized service charge.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\r\nConsideration of Petition for Review\r\nThe Public Records Officer shall promptly refer the petition to a District official designated to conduct the review, who will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the District\u2019s receipt of the petition, or within such other time to which the District and the requestor mutually agree.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to request an internal review, you may petition in writing under Procedure 4040P. \u201cThe petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\u201d\r\n\r\nYour request has not been denied. You have been provided access to hundreds of digital copies of video recordings as you requested. Also, you have been provided with an estimated date of September 23, 2021 for a third installment.\r\n\r\nIf your request for a review under Procedure 4040P is intended to address the question of the District\u2019s inquiry as to a commercial purpose under RCW 42.56.080(2), please identify that issue in the petition.\r\nIt is the District\u2019s position that it has the right and statutory obligation under RCW 42.56.080(2) to conduct such an inquiry with respect to your request. The Declaration forms you have been provided explain the statutory basis for this obligation. Until you submit a completed and signed Commercial Purposes Declaration, and the District has completed its inquiry, the District will not be able to proceed to process additional potentially responsive recordings. The reason for this is that additional potentially responsive recordings may contain auditory and/or visual lists of individuals. In order to properly respond further to your request, and to avoid duplicative review and processing, the District needs to complete its inquiry as to whether your request has a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nPlease advise whether you will complete the Commercial Purposes Declaration provided to you earlier today, as revised (attached), by the extended deadline of June 8, 2021.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You state, \u201cThe various links \r\n you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally \r\n requested.\u201d That is not correct. You have been provided with access to hundreds of original \r\n digital video recordings that are responsive to your request. \r\n Referring a requestor by means of a link to an agency\u2019s publicly maintained webpage or \r\n website, on which requested records are or may be posted, is an appropriate manner in which \r\n to respond to a public records request. \r\n I do not understand your objection in this regard. If you need assistance retrieving the digital \r\n video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\u201d \r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nYou provided links to STREAM or VIEW digital videos online. I have requested COPIES of the digital video \r\nmedia files themselves. The links you have sent to not provide a digital copy of the original video, which \r\nis what was originally requested. \r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia on the nature of Streaming Media: \r\n\r\n Streaming media is multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner \r\n from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. Streaming refers to \r\n the delivery method of content, rather than the content itself. \r\n\r\n Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the \r\n entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. \r\n\r\nThe links you provided to STREAM the digital video files all stream videos that appear to have been \r\nedited. What content has been edited from the original videos? What are the file names of each digital \r\nvideo file? When was each digital file created? In what format was each digital video file stored? Why \r\nhave you not provided exemption logs explaining what content was redacted or edited from each digital \r\nmedia file and why? Which digital video files have been withheld in their entirety and why? \r\n\r\nYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited. You are \r\ncorrect in that if I had requested to \u201cview\u201d various digital video streams, the District providing a link to \r\npublicly maintained websites to \u201cview\u201d the content of the videos would most likely satisfy such a \r\nrequest. Links to stream video files do not satisfy this public records request. \r\n\r\nThis request is and always has been for DIGITAL COPIES of the ORIGINAL DIGITAL MEDIA VIDEO FILES \r\nthemselves. Preferably unedited and unredacted except were allowed by law, each file produced in its \r\noriginal native digital media format. Delivered to the requestor via internet link or in the alternative on \r\ndata CD-ROM. \r\n\r\nIf in fact the links you have provided can provide an original copy of the original digital media video files \r\nrequested in original native digital format unedited, with the original dates of creation and file names \r\nattached, then yes I do require assistance. I am unaware as to how to receive original unedited digital \r\nvideo files from YouTube and Facebook Links.  \r\n\r\nPlease see this partial YOUTUBE Terms of Service Agreement: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms \r\n\r\n \u201c\u2026Permissions and Restrictions \r\n You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with \r\n this Agreement and applicable law.

RCW 42.56.070(8).\u201d \r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nI have requested no list of individuals and this public records request is not for commercial purposes. \r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): \r\n\r\n \u201d The Public Records Act expressly authorizes an agency to inquire as to a requestor\u2019s purpose \r\n when necessary, to determine whether the requestor is seeking a list of individuals for \r\n commercial purposes.

Agencies shall \r\n not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is \r\n overbroad. Agencies shall not distinguish among persons requesting records, and such persons \r\n shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request except to \r\n establish whether inspection and copying would violate RCW 42.56.070(8) or 42.56.240(14), or \r\n other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to \r\n certain persons. \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.070(8) \r\n\r\n This chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the \r\n secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, \r\n sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, \r\n the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of \r\n representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, \r\n HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall \r\n be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized \r\n by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge \r\n therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause \r\n pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative \r\n procedure act. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) does not apply.

A law enforcement or corrections agency \r\n shall not disclose a body worn camera recording to the extent the recording is exempt under \r\n this subsection. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.240(14) does not apply.

For that \r\n reason, it is appropriate for the District to conduct an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2).\u201d \r\n\r\nMy answer to the District\u2019s inquiry: I have requested no list of individuals for a commercial purpose. No \r\nportion of this public records request seeks a list of individuals and no portion of this public records \r\nrequest is for a commercial purpose of any kind. \r\n\r\nThis records request is for \u201cdigital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, \r\ncustody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21\u201d requests digital copies of \r\nspecific identifiable and subsequently identified public records.  \r\n\r\nIt is in the best interests of the public that the District preserve all digital video file public records \r\nrequested, and provide copies of these public records as requested as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nFrom: Bellevue School District\r\n06/04/2021 \r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nYou do not address in your response below my second email to you on June 1 at 5:17 PM Pacific Time with respect to your request for an internal review of your request under Procedure 4040P. I intend to assist you promptly if it is your intention to proceed in that regard. Please advise if you intend to proceed with an internal review. If so, please identify precisely the issues you wish to have reviewed by submitting a petition as described in Procedure 4040P.  I will be able to refer a petition for an internal review upon receipt of a petition.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that videos posted on the sites I have provided to you can be downloaded.  I will check further on that with our IT Department and advise further.\r\n\r\nYou state, \u201cYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited.\u201d (Emphasis in your text.) I am not aware of editing that may have been done in any of the posted videos, or how you may have formed such an opinion by viewing them. My understanding is that the posted videos are original, final records. Board of director meeting videos, for example, would not have been edited prior to being posted on BoardDocs and the District\u2019s YouTube Channel.\r\n\r\nIf in a particular case there may have been an earlier version of a posted video, it is possible that the creator may have a draft of the video, which may be exempt under RCW 42.56.280, or which may have been in the form of an informal note and not a public record.\r\n\r\nYou also inquire about the name and date of videos, and their format. The name and date of posting are viewable in the platforms to which you have been given access. Dates of creation may be additionally stated within a video, if a video was created before it was posted. The records speak for themselves as to these questions.\r\n\r\nAs I have explained, by providing you the hundreds of videos you have been provided to date, the District is not concluding your request. Rather, the District has promptly provided to you the readily available records that exist. The District is not asserting exemptions in the videos you have been provided. The process of assembling additional videos created and maintained by individual staff persons is an enormous and lengthy task, for the reasons I have described to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that it is part of the District\u2019s recordkeeping system that your PRR request number appear at the beginning of the subject line of emails pertaining to your request. In some of my reply correspondence to you, your subject line has been too long to permit the PRR number to be inserted, so I have had to delete or truncate some of your subject line. I would appreciate it if you can shorten your subject line in some manner and include the PRR number in all of your correspondence to this office.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A. Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nFrom: Anon Request\r\n06/14/2021 \r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: PRR 04262021\r\n\r\nJune 14, 2021\r\n\r\nHello Ms. Boyer,\r\n\r\nThank you for your communications dated 6-4-21.\r\n\r\nMy response is as follows:\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\r\n\u201cDear Requestor:\r\n\r\nYou do not address in your response below my second email to you on June 1 at 5:17 PM Pacific Time with respect to your request for an internal review of your request under Procedure 4040P. I intend to assist you promptly if it is your intention to proceed in that regard. Please advise if you intend to proceed with an internal review. If so, please identify precisely the issues you wish to have reviewed by submitting a petition as described in Procedure 4040P. I will be able to refer a petition for an internal review upon receipt of a petition.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that videos posted on the sites I have provided to you can be downloaded. I will check further on that with our IT Department and advise further.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI request an internal review per Procedure No. 4040P - Public Access to District Records. My petition for internal review follows at the end of this communication.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou state, \u201cYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited.\u201d (Emphasis in your text.) I am not aware of editing that may have been done in any of the posted videos, or how you may have formed such an opinion by viewing them. My understanding is that the posted videos are original, final records. Board of director meeting videos, for example, would not have been edited prior to being posted on BoardDocs and the District\u2019s YouTube Channel.\r\n\r\nIf in a particular case there may have been an earlier version of a posted video, it is possible that the creator may have a draft of the video, which may be exempt under RCW 42.56.280, or which may have been in the form of an informal note and not a public record.\r\nYou also inquire about the name and date of videos, and their format. The name and date of posting are viewable in the platforms to which you have been given access. Dates of creation may be additionally stated within a video, if a video was created before it was posted. The records speak for themselves as to these questions.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nTo date you have provided zero requested records. No exemption logs of records you allege to have produced have been provided. No digital copies of any digital videos requested have been provided. \r\nYou have provided links to the following 3rd party services, none of which provide digital copies of the digital video files requested:\r\n\r\nFACEBOOK\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bsd405\r\n \r\nNO ACCESS. NO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM \r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bellevueschools405/\r\n\r\nNO ACCESS. NO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nTWITTER\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/TheBSD405\r\n\r\nNO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nYOUTUBE\r\n \r\nNO ACCESS. NO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nBOARDDOCS\u00ae A DILIGENT BRAND, \u00a9 2002-2021\r\n\r\nDistrict website: https://bsd405.org/\r\n \r\nNO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nAgain, none of the requested records have been provided. No exemption logs have been provided.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I have explained, by providing you the hundreds of videos you have been provided to date, the District is not concluding your request. Rather, the District has promptly provided to you the readily available records that exist. The District is not asserting exemptions in the videos you have been provided. The process of assembling additional videos created and maintained by individual staff persons is an enormous and lengthy task, for the reasons I have described to you.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nNo requested records have been provided. No exemption logs have been provided. The process of locating and providing copies of the digital video files originally requested (public records that have been properly identified under the PRA) is the legal obligation and responsibility of the District. Continuing to argue and object about the scope of the task is prohibited by the Public Records Act. \r\nThis public records request is not vague, nor overly broad in nature. \r\n\r\nThis public records request is for identifiable records.\r\n\r\nThis public records request does not seek records extraordinary in nature, nor does the request seek a complication of records to be produced, nor does the request seek a list or lists of any kind. \r\nThis public records request is in the best interest of the general public.\r\n\r\nThe District has the option to produce the public records in installments over time.\r\n\r\nTo date, the District has not produced a single record, nor has the District produced an exemption log of any kind.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cFinally, please note that it is part of the District\u2019s recordkeeping system that your PRR request number appear at the beginning of the subject line of emails pertaining to your request. In some of my reply correspondence to you, your subject line has been too long to permit the PRR number to be inserted, so I have had to delete or truncate some of your subject line. I would appreciate it if you can shorten your subject line in some manner and include the PRR number in all of your correspondence to this office.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A. Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\nI am not sure I understand what you are asking, however I will endeavor to do my best in assisting you with your internal record keeping if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETITION FOR INTERNAL REVIEW [THIS PETITION]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTHIS CONCLUDES MY PETITION FOR INTERNAL REVIEW re: Procedure No. 4040P - Public Access to District Records\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",

My understanding is that Facebook and Instagram may require that you sign in to gain access.\r\nI understand that you have been able to view but not download copies of records from the links provided to you to District's YouTube site, the District's website, the BoardDocs page within the District's website, and the District's Twitter account, and for that reason you are asking for copies of video recordings. Please confirm whether my understandings are correct.\r\n\r\nThe next estimated installment date, as set forth to you in my message dated May 27, 2021, is September 23, 2021. Your request will be completed in a series of installments. The particular factors pertaining to your request that affect the next estimated installment date have been explained to you, with respect to what is reasonable and technologically feasible for the District. Those factors will continue to be assessed. Additional factors affecting that estimated date include the fact that the public records office is presently responding to multiple requests, a number of which were received before yours; the volume of potentially responsive records; the technological complexity of your request; and the workload of this department and of multiple other staff persons whose assistance is needed in processing your request. The estimate may also be affected by the conditions of working remotely in the present public health circumstances, and unanticipated events or conditions, such as emergency projects or technology limitations.\r\nIf it is possible to provide additional records to you earlier than the September 23, 2021 estimate, it will be done.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

My understanding is \tthat Facebook and Instagram may require that you sign in to gain access.\r\n\t\r\nI understand that you have been able to view but not download copies of records from the \tlinks provided to you to District's YouTube site, the District's website, the BoardDocs page \twithin the District's website, and the District's Twitter account, and for that reason you are \tasking for copies of video recordings. Please confirm whether my understandings are correct.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI have not requested identifiable public records from Facebook, Instagram, or any party not subject to the Washington State Public Records Act RCW 42.56. I have identified and requested digital copies of specific video recordings in the care, custody, or control of the Bellevue School District, a Washington State Public Agency. Copies of these digital video recordings were requested to be produced by the District via direct internet download link, email, or cd-rom.\r\n\r\nRegarding the links provided to the District's YouTube site, the District's website, the BoardDocs page within the District's website, and the District's Twitter account, these links do not provide direct download access to the digital video recordings originally requested. \r\n\r\nTo \u201ccorrect your understanding\u201d the original public records request dated 04-26-2021 specifically requested the following:\r\n\r\n\u201cDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, if the District is in possession of any digital recordings of Zoom meeting calls, Skype Sessions, Google Duo calls, Slack, Gotomeeting, etc. (any recorded internet-based video communication/presentation/instruction product) for the period of time 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 I am requesting a digital copy to be produced via internet web link.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should include all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by the District.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should also include a search of all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by District employees if the digital video was recorded on equipment provided to the employee by the District, or if the digital video recording contains content relating to District agency related matters.\r\n\r\nI request the digital video files to be delivered unedited whenever possible and in the original format in which the files were digitally recorded and stored.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by internet web link or e-mail attachment if available or by CD-ROM if not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 132, 580 P.2d 246 (1978) and WAC 44-14-04004 - Responsibilities of agency in providing records.\r\n\r\nI hope on 12.1.21 the most resent District quoted installment date the District begins to provide a first installment of COPIES of the public record digital video files originally requested on 04.25.21. \r\n\r\nThank you.",

If this is installment #3 please provide installments #1 and #2. \r\n\r\nQuestions regarding exemptions in this installment:\r\n\r\nThe exemption log you provided noted that eight (8) video files were withheld in their entirety based on exemption codes 1A (RCW 42.56.230(1), RCW 42.56.070(1), AND 20 USC \u00a7 1232g) and 10A (RCW 42.56.070(1),20 USC \u00a7 1232g,26 USC \u00a7 1603,RCW 82.32.330, RCW 84.08.2103) RCW 70.02.020(1).220-.260,42 USC \u00a7 1320d, 45 CFR Part 160.103, 45 CFR Part 164.104(b),Chapter 19.108 RCW, RCW 4.24.611(3),RCW 51.28.070,RCW 51.36.060, United States \r\nConstitution, Washington State Constitution). \r\n\r\nI object to the District's withholding of these video files in their entirety. These (8) video files are NOT entirely exempt, only portions of these video files may be. The District bears the responsibility to redact portions of these files where necessary and then provide the nonexempt portion of the video files as originally requested.\r\n\r\nPlease see:\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04004  Responsibilities of agency in providing records.\r\n\r\n(4) Failure to provide records. A \"denial\" of a request can occur when an agency: Fails to respond to a request; Claims an exemption of the entire record or a portion of it; Without justification, fails to provide the record after the reasonable estimate of time to respond expires;\r\n\r\n(5) Claiming exemptions.\r\n\r\n(a) Redactions. If a portion of a record is exempt from disclosure, but the remainder is not, an agency generally is required to redact (black out) the exempt portion and then provide the remainder. RCW 42.56.210(1). Withholding an entire record where only a portion of it is exempt violates the act.\r\n\r\nSeattle Firefighters Union Local No. 27 v. Hollister, 48 Wn. App. 129, 132, 737 P.2d 1302 (1987).\r\n\r\nPlease redact as allowed by law and produce the non-exempt portions of the (8) video files the District has withheld in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "PRR 04262021-Anon-MuckRock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nI appreciate that you may wish your request could be completed more quickly. I share that goal with you.\r\nPlease let me explain some background that I hope will help you have realistic expectations so that you will not become frustrated.\r\nTo date, you have received six installments in response to your request.  I am grateful to have your inquiries, because I was intending at this point to ask you some clarification questions that have arisen about your request.\r\n\r\nInitially, please let me note in response to your message, that I do not make \"excuses,\" or \"sell[]\" \"prevarications.\" I operate ethically, within a local governmental agency with a primary mission of educating students. The District takes seriously its obligations to be transparent and to provide the highest level possible of service to requestors of public records, consistent with the purpose of the Public Records Act to provide full access to information concerning the conduct of government, while being mindful of the privacy rights of individuals and the efficient administration of government.\r\n\r\nEstimated dates are estimates. They are subject to adjustment.\r\nThe differing factors I have cited with respect to the need to extend the estimated dates of your installments are factual and specific to each extension. It would not be ethical for me to provide you with the names of employees whose absence due to illness or other causes affected an estimated installment date.\r\n\r\nI am one person in a small legal department of four persons. I am the only person in the District whose primary responsibility is to respond to public records requests. I have other duties. Sometimes time-sensitive tasks intervene that require an adjustment of the estimated response dates to public record requests. I attempt to let you know on or before an estimated date if a change is needed. It is not always possible to do so.\r\n\r\nI am an optimist. If a reschedule is needed, I try to re-set the date as soon as possible, as I did during the month of July 2022. If you prefer not to get as many status notifications, I can, in your case, re-set revised estimates farther into the future.\r\n\r\nYours is one of scores of open records requests that are pending in the Bellevue School District. I have an obligation to treat all requestors evenhandedly.\r\nAbsent special circumstances, I cannot prioritize the request of one person above that of other requestors, who are also waiting for records for which they have an earnest and important need that is meaningful to them.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your request is particularly complex and time-consuming to process. Each installment requires that I access a large database of stored videos. Each video must be reviewed carefully, which usually means watching it in its entirety, in order to determine if it contains exempt material. The large volume of the digital records produced requires special handling and transmission procedures, which adds to the time required to make each installment. Additionally, and importantly, many of the videos reviewed (about half of them, to date) are exempt. The most frequent basis for exemption has been confidential student information. That requires the preparation of exemption logs, which adds significantly to the time required for each installment.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\nYou have received six installments of digital recordings, which represented a variety of types of digital recordings. You have had the opportunity, in the logs provided to you, to see descriptions of the types of recordings that are exempt. Due to the remote learning that occurred during the pandemic closures, many hundreds of recordings remain to be reviewed in response to your request, as it is currently written.\r\nOn the other hand, if you are able to specify your request at this time in a way that is consistent with your purpose, which I assume, based on the Public Records Act, is to become informed about the conduct of government in some respect that is meaningful and importnat to you, your request can likely be completed much more efficiently.\r\nIn that context, so that I can best serve you, please answer the following clarification questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Are you able to specify a type of digital recording that would allow the District to serve you more efficiently so that your intended purpose can be met?\r\n  2.  Are you able to specify a topic of digital recording that would allow the District to serve you more efficiently so that your intended purpose can be met?\r\n  3.  Most of the exempt records are classroom lesson recordings in which students are identified. Do you agree that you do not need classroom videos to meet your intended purpose to become informed about the conduct of government in some respect that is meaningful and important to you?\r\n\r\nYour answers to these clarification questions are due within 30 days, that is, on or before September 8. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District's response, including the next installment.\r\nI will re-set the next estimated installment date to September 12, so that you need not receive another installment of records in which you have no interest.\r\n\r\nFinally, please communicate with this office using the address publicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>.\r\nAlso, please do not cut or excerpt the correspondence history of your request.  Reliable and convenient access to a complete correspondence history is essential to the efficient processing of your request. The MuckRock site is not convenient for that purpose.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You are wrong.\r\n\r\nYou have not and do not perform adequate searches for responsive records if in fact you perform any search at all.\r\n\r\nYour continued multiple attempts to limit each properly submitted public records request (illegally) for your own self-serving needs is inexcusable and you have been told to STOP.\r\n\r\nYou ridiculously continue to debate even the most simple concepts and seemingly congratulate yourself on your application of obtuse Clinton-esqe statements such as \"I would need clarification of what the definition of is is?\"\r\n\r\nHere is how you can BEST SERVE ME (ME BEING THE PUBLIC):\r\n\r\n1. Keep your personal problems to yourself forever and always. No one cares.\r\n\t\"I am one person in a small legal department of four persons.\" Irrelevant.\r\n\t\"I am the only person in the District whose primary responsibility is to respond to public records requests.\" Will this be the District\u2019s defense in Superior Court for repeatedly violating RCW 42.56 by silently withholding repeatedly requested responsive documents for YEARS?\r\n\t\"I have other duties.\" Oh, wait I take it all back. You are right. RCW 42.56 and Washington State Law take a back seat, Helen has \"other duties.\" Wait, umm no.\r\n\t\"Sometimes time-sensitive tasks intervene that require an adjustment of the estimated response dates to public record requests.\" Thanks mom. Like needlessly torturing members of the public with your endless self-serving Dr. Phil debates like this one?\r\n\t\"I am an optimist.\" Good for you. Again, see Dr. Phil.\r\n\t\"Absent special circumstances, I cannot prioritize the request of one person above that of other requestors, who are also waiting for records for which they have an earnest and important need that is meaningful to them.\" No one here ever asked you to prioritize anything, rather we just beg you to do you job and stop with the whining, arguing, and silent withholding. Meanwhile under what \"special circumstances\" would those be? I missed that non existent portion of the Public Records Act that imparts you with such power.\r\n\r\n2. You are a public employee. Do your job.\r\n\r\n3. Follow Washington State Law. Duh.\r\n\r\n4. For the last time stop requesting this PRA to be limited in it's scope. This is not your business. Work as directed. Your clarification questions have been asked and answered REPEATEDLY.\r\n\r\nHERE YOU GO AGAIN - ANSWERS TO YOUR CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS - YOU WILL NOTE THE ANSWER SHOULD SEEM FAMILIAR TO YOU (in quotes):\r\n\r\n\"From: Anon Request\r\nRE: Request for digital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21. (Bellevue School District)\r\n04/25/2021\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, if the District is in possession of any digital recordings of Zoom meeting calls, Skype Sessions, Google Duo calls, Slack, Gotomeeting, etc. (any recorded internet-based video communication/presentation/instruction product) for the period of time 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 I am requesting a digital copy to be produced via internet web link.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should include all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by the District.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should also include a search of all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by District employees if the digital video was recorded on equipment provided to the employee by the District, or if the digital video recording contains content relating to District agency related matters.\r\n\r\nI request the digital video files to be delivered unedited whenever possible and in the original format in which the files were digitally recorded and stored.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by internet web link or e-mail attachment if available or by CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnon Request\"\r\n\r\nFinally, a quick response on your unnecessary self-serving  \"how hard you have it\" summary:\r\n\r\n\"Please note that your request is particularly complex and time-consuming to process. Each installment requires that I access a large database of stored videos. Each video must be reviewed carefully, which usually means watching it in its entirety, in order to determine if it contains exempt material. The large volume of the digital records produced requires special handling and transmission procedures, which adds to the time required to make each installment. Additionally, and importantly, many of the videos reviewed (about half of them, to date) are exempt. The most frequent basis for exemption has been confidential student information. That requires the preparation of exemption logs, which adds significantly to the time required for each installment.\"\r\n\r\nWe have received 5 installments not 6 installments. You also never provided a \"cure\" for the 3rd party referral videos that could not be copied as requested over a year ago. COPIES. Not links to 3rd party websites. Read the public records act. COPIES. \r\n\r\nMost of your redactions and exemptions are improper and you continue to silently withhold responsive public records, both the videos you do not redact and the videos you silently withhold in full. If this continues, we do anticipate seeking judicial review. Most likely good news for you, as that appears what you are pushing for considering your District\u2019s history with the Public Records Act, the many times suit has been filed against your District over this very practice, and your continued offensively dismissive response to the District's non-exhaustive obligations under the law concerning this public records request. A request which is now 15 Months and 3 weeks old with 28 videos produced out of what can only be conservatively speculated as tens of thousands of possible responsive videos.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G.

Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k).

Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

There was only one SRO for the timeframe you are inquiring about.  I would normally not know how many guidance counselors there are but I asked the SRO and he replied that there are two of them.  I would not have a record of how many if any, calls came through our 911 System. You would need to inquire with the Communications Department for that information.  The School\u2019s SRO is not paid by them, he is paid through the Police Department.  Just for a point of information, the Police Department has Officer Blue and he goes to School every day with the main SRO and he is our comfort dog.  Attached please find a spreadsheet of information for the \u201creferral\u201d aspect of the request.  The SRO produced this for me whereas he is directly in contact as being the \u201creferral\u201d person. Today is the 10th business day from the request date.  We made the original goal without needing the extension of time.  I believe this concludes our end of the \u201cPublic Records Request\u201d that you submitted.  Stay safe!\r\n\nDebora A.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Sumner Redstone, whose death has been\r\n    widely reported.

These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. \r\nRESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request.

These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. RESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

It is a requisite that the City Clerk's bond be duly filed with the Office of the Mayor. The current delay in the presentation of your bond raises substantial concerns.

        "communication": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that a misunderstanding has arisen due to a lack of telephonic communication between us, attributed to your decision to terminate the call prematurely. As the appointed City Clerk, it is incumbent upon you to adhere to the principles and responsibilities enshrined in your oath of office, which fundamentally obligates you to serve the public interest. This role inherently positions you as a servant to the constituents you are sworn to serve, thereby establishing a relationship where the constituents are, in effect, the principals in this dynamic.\r\n\r\nThe premature termination of our call not only raises concerns regarding your commitment to these obligations but also poses a potential jeopardy to your tenure in office. It is imperative to highlight the necessity of immediate accessibility to the surety bonds, which, as per legal requirement, must be maintained on file for all city officials at all times. Failure to promptly furnish these documents upon request could potentially expose you, and by extension, the entire City Council, to significant legal repercussions.\r\n\r\nIt is critical to underscore that the operational framework of municipal governance, including the requirement for surety bonds, is grounded in the Constitution of the United States. This foundational document supersedes any state laws to the contrary, ensuring that no deviation from its mandates is permissible. The insistence on accessing these bonds is not subject to discretionary delay and must be addressed forthwith.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to rationalize a delay or non-compliance is unacceptable and necessitates immediate scrutiny. Should there be any failure to comply with these constitutional requirements, it may be requisite to bring this matter to the attention of higher judicial authorities, including the Supreme Court, to review the practices of the City of Aliso Viejo. Such actions are necessary to ensure adherence to the constitutional directives governing the conduct and obligations of city officials at all levels.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS",

I am perplexed as to why this letter was referenced in response to my recent inquiry for all city officials' oaths and bonds. My understanding is that there is no limitation on the number of public records requests I am entitled to submit. Therefore, I seek to clarify and expand my current request under the relevant public records law.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I wish to express my concerns regarding the prolonged period it has taken to fulfill my existing request, which has now extended over a year and a half. Given this delay, I believe it is within my rights to amend my request to include additional documents, specifically the bonds of all city officials and sheriff\u2019s. Which was not part of my original submission. In my original request #15 is where I\u2019ve requested all city officials Oaths.\r\n\r\nI would like to formally request that the aforementioned documents included. It is my hope that this matter can be resolved promptly and efficiently, in accordance with the law governing public records requests.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS",

        "communication": "Attached is information you requested from the Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner. Please note this list will only include cases where the decedent has been identified and their legal next of kin has been notified. It is important to note that this report is based on preliminary information received by the Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner and will only include deaths the coroner\u2019s office investigated in which we could not identify a place of residence for the decedent. For this reason, the report could include individuals who were not homeless. Also, this report does not include deaths that were not investigated by the coroner\u2019s office. For example, a homeless individual who was hospitalized for some time before his or her death, and so was under the care of a doctor, would not be on this list. You may want to check with the Southern Nevada Health District if you haven\u2019t done so already to see what additional data it may be able to provide. Additionally, your request for autopsy records of all individuals who passed away from 2018-2022, poses significant challenges for our office. It would entail staff having to manually pull over a thousand reports and then redacting confidential information that is not subject to state public records laws. Such a request would take us many months to process. Please let me know if the attached information satisfies your request. If there are some specific cases you are interested in receiving more information about, please let me know which ones and I will check with the Coroner\u2019s Office on an estimated time to provide the records and any related costs.",

To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nPublic reports show that Amazon has been active in the Inland Empire and among Inland Empire public agencies: https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-12-05/leaked-document-offers-glimpse-into-how-amazon-amasses-influence-in-the-inland-empire \r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/LorenaSGonzalez/status/1732047860701782381/photo/4 \r\n\r\nTherefore, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1) All presentations and presentation materials (including recorded video and audio, PowerPoint files, prepared remarks, and slides formats), and other information presented to the city/agency by Amazon \r\n\r\n2) A copy of any incident reports relating to Amazon, including attachments and media. \r\n\r\n3) Any emails between the city/district and Amazon employees, including attachments and media. Please limit search to between Jan 1, 2023 and the time this request is processed \r\n\r\n4) Any grants, gifts, contracts, between this agency and Amazon \r\n\r\nResponsive records from Finance and Fire Prevention are available via the Riverside Records Portal.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Gallagher,\r\n\r\nPlease forgive my delay in replying to your November 2 response (attached) to my Pubic Records Act request. I was considering how best to respond.\r\n\r\nRegarding #3 of my request, which was for deployment records, we understand that \"deployment\" may be defined differently in different contexts. We are seeking records of when the equipment was brought out into the public or in an operation (i.e., not for training). \r\n\r\nWe also understand that some agencies only keep records of such deployment when there is a use of force involved, in which case any other type of deployment would have a \"no responsive records\" finding. \r\n\r\nRegarding #1 and #2 of my request, which were for purchase records of certain equipment used by Modesto PD, I would like to amend my request to seek the following:\r\nInventory records of equipment in Modesto PD's possession, if any, for the following types of equipment, for which new state legislation requires publication of information:\r\n\r\n(1) Unmanned, remotely piloted, powered aerial or ground vehicles.\r\n(2) Mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles or armored personnel carriers. However, police versions of standard consumer vehicles are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(3) High mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWV), commonly referred to as Humvees, two and one-half-ton trucks, five-ton trucks, or wheeled vehicles that have a breaching or entry apparatus attached. However, unarmored all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and motorized dirt bikes are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(4) Tracked armored vehicles that provide ballistic protection to their occupants and utilize a tracked system instead of wheels for forward motion.\r\n(5) Command and control vehicles that are either built or modified to facilitate the operational control and direction of public safety units.\r\n(6) Weaponized aircraft, vessels, or vehicles of any kind.\r\n(7) Battering rams, slugs, and breaching apparatuses that are explosive in nature. However, items designed to remove a lock, such as bolt cutters, or a handheld ram designed to be operated by one person, are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(8) Firearms of .50 caliber or greater. However, standard issue shotguns are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(9) Ammunition of .50 caliber or greater. However, standard issue shotgun ammunition is specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(10) Specialized firearms and ammunition of less than .50 caliber, including assault weapons as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code, with the exception of standard issue service weapons and ammunition of less than .50 caliber that are issued to officers, agents, or employees of a law enforcement agency or a state agency.\r\n(11) Any firearm or firearm accessory that is designed to launch explosive projectiles.\r\n(12) \u201cFlashbang\u201d grenades and explosive breaching tools, \u201ctear gas,\u201d and \u201cpepper balls,\u201d excluding standard, service-issued handheld pepper spray.\r\n(13) Taser Shockwave, microwave weapons, water cannons, and the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD).\r\n(14) The following projectile launch platforms and their associated munitions: 40mm projectile launchers, \u201cbean bag,\u201d rubber bullet, and specialty impact munition (SIM) weapons.\r\n\r\nPlease include equipment that may be assigned to or designated for use by special units or jails.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the above list of types of equipment is taken verbatim from legislation enacted on September 30, 2021 (AB 481, see https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB481). This legislation will require all police departments and sheriff offices in California to publish use policies by May 1, 2022 that include, for each type of equipment named above that the agency has acquired and seeks to continue to use, \"a description of each type of military equipment, the quantity [acquired], its capabilities, expected lifespan, and product descriptions from the manufacturer of the military equipment.\" The legislation requires that agencies publish this information on their web sites and submit the information to local city councils or boards of supervisors.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the legislature has determined that information on the number and description of these articles possessed by law enforcement agencies in California is not exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act. While responding to this request may require some staff time, we understand that AB 481 will require this and other work from the department in the coming months. \r\n\r\nI appreciate your efforts in response to this request. \r\n\r\nbest,\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland\r\n\r\n",

In your Jan. 21, 2022 response, there was a request for clarification regarding the portion of my request that dealt with patrol rifles (or assault rifles as defined by California law). I responded with a clarification on Jan. 22. I have not received a response to this portion of my request since then. \r\n\r\nI attach the City's Jan. 21, 2022 response and below is my response to the request for clarification.\r\n\r\nCan you let me know by when the City will response to this portion of my request?\r\n\r\nThanks so much.\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland\r\n\r\n\r\nJan. 22 email:\r\nDear Ms. Gallagher,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your response. I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nRegarding inventory records for Item #10, your staff requested clarification. This refers to \"assault rifles as defined in Sections 30510 and 301515 of the Penal Code.\" These are typically referred to by law enforcement as \"patrol rifles\".\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland\r\n510-282-8983",

It is not necessary to upload these responses together -- whichever comes out first is fine. \r\n\r\nFinally, the time period I'm looking for here is February 18th to the date the request is filed. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJake\r\n\r\n914 500 3940",

In response to number 2 of your request, the FOIA Office was able to locate 5 letters out of the list of schools you provided. Those letters are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. Section 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request. The FOIA requires that requests describe the records sought with sufficient detail to allow an agency employee familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.\u202f The FWS does not have a central record repository. As such your request would require each office in the FWS to conduct a manual search for records you have requested. This type of search would place inordinate burden on the FWS's resources. If you wish to pursue your request, please include specific information about the records sought, including the office (s) you believe may have responsive records. In general, the more specific the request describes the records sought, the greater likelihood we will be able to locate those records. According to our regulations, if we do not receive your written response clarifying what records you are looking for within 20 workdays from the date of this letter, we will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request, we will not be able to comply with your request, and we will close our file on it. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.5(d).\u202f You may seek assistance from us or the Department's FOIA Public Liaison as described below. Mediation/Dispute Resolution  You may contact us at fwhq_foia@fws.gov for assistance with your request.\u00a0 If after contacting us, you need further information or assistance with your request, you may wish to seek dispute resolution services from the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Natasha Jones by email at doifoiapublicliaison@sol.doi.gov.  If you need further information or assistance after contacting the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, you may wish to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). The 2007 FOIA amendments created the OGIS to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.\u202f Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.\u202f You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS College Park, MD 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Web: https://www.archives.gov/ogis  Telephone: 202-741-5770 Fax: 202-741-5769 Toll-free: 1-877-684-6448 Please note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of filing an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer. Appeal Rights You may also file an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer regarding this response. If you choose to appeal, the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer must receive your FOIA appeal no later than 90 workdays from the date of this communication.\u202f Appeals arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, will be deemed received on the next workday. Your appeal must be made in writing.\u202f You may submit your appeal and accompanying materials to the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer by mail, courier service, fax, or email.\u202f All communications concerning your appeal should be clearly marked with the words: \"FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.\"\u202f You must include an explanation of why you believe this response is in error.\u202f You must also include with your appeal copies of all correspondence between you and FWS concerning your FOIA request, including your original FOIA request and this response.\u202f Failure to include with your appeal all correspondence between you and FWS will result in the Department's rejection of your appeal, unless the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer determines (in the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer\u2019s sole discretion) that good cause exists to accept the defective appeal. Please include your name and daytime telephone number (or the name and telephone number of an appropriate contact), email address and fax number (if available) in case the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer needs additional information or clarification of your appeal.

Fee Category and Fee \r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks. Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 80 days from the date of receipt for processing. Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 281 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 774 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 879 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nLeanna Ramsey\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997",

Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Additionally, L.E.A.D.S. hit responses, patient condition, unique identifiers, residential addresses, license plate numbers, driver's license numbers and personal telephone numbers have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) which authorizes a public body to redact: Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

        "communication": "On December 19, the department of education sent an email regarding this request (#F22,727,FOIL-2023-040-00555) to 154445-13358908@requests.muckrock.com. That's incorrect. The correct email address is 154447-94133837@requests.muckrock.com. It appears that a responsive document was similarly shared to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the production of a single responsive document. Though it is exceptionally confusing that it was delivered to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me why this continues, I have informed the department of education multiple times that MuckRock is designed to improve the FOIL experience for citizens and records access agencies in part by assigning unique email addresses to each filed request. Sending communications about requests to addresses other than the unique email address assigned to each request obfuscates and confuses the process greatly. Please fix this. I believe this to be an honest mistake, but if it continues I will start to question that assumption. I do not wish to argue or fight over this. It's just making things unnecessarily difficult for both of us.\r\n\r\nIn the December 19 communication, the agency first quoted the DOE regulations as such:\r\n\r\n----\r\nPursuant to Section VI.C of New York City Department of Education (DOE) Chancellor\u2019s Regulation D-110 (CR D-110), factors to be considered under CR D-110 in determining whether there exist circumstances necessitating more \r\ntime to respond to a request may include, but are not limited to:\r\n\u201c[1] the volume of a request, [2] the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating records, [3] the complexity of the request, [4] the need to review records to determine the extent to which they must be disclosed, [and 5] the number of requests received by the agency.\u201d1\r\n----\r\n...and then addresses the number of requests in progress:\r\n\"With respect to factor 5, at the time you made \r\nyour request, many other FOIL requests were already pending, many of which involved multiple factors, or all the factors cited above. A response to your request is expected by January 22, 2024.\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what I am addressing. \r\n\r\nThe text of the law and the case law I have reviewed shows the agency has obvious authority to extend the time to respond to a request. This also has been shown in court to apply when agencies have numerous requests to handle.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that the agency is acknowledging awareness of factors that might reasonably delay the fulfillment of the request by December 19, 2023.\r\n\r\nAt no point prior to the deadline was the estimated completion date updated.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, I have dealt with city agencies repeating the delay of fulfillment in increments of 1-3 months for up to two years at a time. At no point did any of them provide an accurate estimation of the completion date.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that records access officers are competent at their jobs and intelligent individuals, thus it strains my sense of credulity to accept that delays are so consistently unforseen and unforeseeable to the point where completion dates must routinely and normally be extended. It has further drained my sense of patience in dealing with agencies when the obvious happens. \r\n\r\nI have no qualm with the individual records access officer about this issue. I believe they are merely stuck working with a system that undervalues FOIL, and places overworked employees in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nThat does nothing to detract from the absurdity of an agency that first understaffs the FOIL positions, initially promises completion dates that are short enough to beguile requesters (but are rarely met), and then claims a lack of foresight about the failure to meet self imposed completion dates. Surely Kafka might've mistaken it for an excerpt from his work should he be alive today!\r\n\r\nThe law requires that agencies provide: \"a date certain within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances, when the request will be granted in whole or in part\". Viewed through the isolated lens of each individual communication and interaction, it may very well appear reasonable to delay a given request by some arbitrary amount of time. Viewed in the larger picture, it is hard to conceive of the reasonableness of the situation. The majority of FOIL requests in the state are late enough to make a mockery of the intent of the freedom of information law. This is what I intend to fight when I refuse to accept extensions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven these facts, I am requesting solid and sincere confirmation that the January 22, 2024 completion date will be met.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot commit to that date with the information that is available between November 9, 2023 and now, I will appeal on the grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\nIf you commit to that date and miss it, I will appeal on the grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
