        "communication": "ORS Reference number 2400603.\r\n\r\nOpen Investigation with the FBI\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon careful consideration and application of the required Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test, it is my determination that public policies favoring nondisclosure outweigh any public interest in disclosure.  The records that you have requested pertain to an investigation that is currently on-going.  In Linzmeyer v. Forcey, 2002 WI 84, \u00b6 30, 254 Wis. 2d 306, the Wisconsin Supreme Court opined that when an investigation is on-going the \u201cgeneral presumption of openness will likely be overcome.\u201d  Law enforcement records pertaining to ongoing investigations can be particularly sensitive.  In this instance, release of the requested records related to the on-going investigation, prior to its completion, could compromise or prejudice additional investigation, could impact the ability of law enforcement to gain cooperation from potential witnesses, and could infringe on the reputation and privacy of victims and witnesses.  The records also contain raw investigation data gathered from witnesses of varying degrees of reliability that has not yet been properly verified.  See Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 30-39; see alsoJournal/Sentinel, Inc. v. Aagerup, 145 Wis. 2d 818 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic policies in favor of keeping strategies for crime detection and prevention were also considered.  See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d).  The exceptions to the requirement of a government body to meet in open session under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85 are indicative of public policy and may be used as grounds for denying a public records request after application of the balancing test.  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a).  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d) has been interpreted by courts as being representative as a public policy favoring nondisclosure of records related to ongoing criminal investigations.  See e.g. Aagerup, 145 Wis.2d at 825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso considered was whether disclosure of the records that relate to the ongoing investigation would reveal prosecutorial techniques or strategies.  \u201cPublic records containing prosecution strategies and police tactics are not specifically excepted from disclosure by Wisconsin statutes, but records custodians can properly consider such content when determining \u2018whether the presumption of openness \u2026 is overcome by another public policy.\u2019\u201d  Democratic Party of Wisconsin v. Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of Justice, 2016 WI 100, \u00b6 18, 372 Wis.2d 460.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, although the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 5 USC \u00a7 552 does not apply to Wisconsin, Wisconsin Courts have held that FOIA exceptions may be considered when applying the balancing test.  See Linzmeyer, 2002 WI 84; Kraemer Bros. v. Dane County, 229 Wis. 2d 86, 103 (Ct. App. 1999), review denied, 231 Wis. 2d 375 (1999).  The relevant FOIA exception includes section 7(E) (records which disclose techniques, procedures or guidelines for law enforcement investigations) 5 USC \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(7)(E).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, pursuant to the reasons set forth above, your request for records that pertain to the ongoing investigation that you have referenced is being denied.  If you wish, you may resubmit your request once the investigation has concluded.  If you choose to do so, your request will be re-evaluated at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis determination is subject to review by mandamus action under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1), or upon an application to the Wisconsin Attorney General or the Milwaukee County Corporation Counsel.\r\n\nSergeant Jason Kotarak\r\nOpen Records Section\r\nMilwaukee Police Department",

City of Baraboo, 2005 WI 120, \u00b6 28 (citations omitted.)  Notwithstanding the presumption of openness, the public\u2019s right to access to public records is not absolute.  Journal/Sentinel v. Aagerup, 145 Wis. 2d 818, 822 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\nAt this time, the record that you have requested has been forwarded to the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office for investigation. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that documents relating to a pending investigation may be withheld from inspection.  Newspapers, Inc. v. Breier, 89 Wis. 2d 417, 438 (1979).  Relying upon Breier, the Wisconsin Attorney General has stated that such \u201cstatements by the court reveal sensitivity to the reputational interests of persons under investigation and indicate it may very well be proper to keep investigation files confidential until the investigation is substantially completed.\u201d  73 Wis. Op. Atty. Gen. 38, 43 (February 17, 1984).  Furthermore, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has also held that when \u201cthe release of a police record would interfere with an on-going prosecution or investigation, the general presumption of openness will likely be overcome.\u201d  Linzmeyer v. Forcey, 2002 WI 84, \u00b6 30, 254 Wis. 2d 306.\r\n\r\nIn, 2008 Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that record custodians, except for a prosecutor, may not rely on the common law exception for public access to prosecution files when denying a public records request.  Portgage Daily Register v. Columbia County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t. 2008 WI App. 30.  The court of appeals held that the records custodian must include policy reasons for nondisclosure of records pertaining to an ongoing criminal investigation. However, as the attorney general made clear in an informal opinion, the public\u2019s interest in not undermining a criminal prosecution is one of the public-policy interests that may outweigh the presumption of disclosure for police records that have been forwarded to the district attorney. Informal Correspondence from Wis. Att\u2019y. Gen. to Mr. Dean Collins, City of Brookfield Assistant Chief of Police (Nov. 13, 2007).\r\n\r\nRegarding your request, because of the serious public interest in ensuring a thorough, unimpeded, and unbiased criminal investigation of this matter, and after carefully conducting the required balancing test, it is the record custodian\u2019s determination that the balance tips in favor of nondisclosure.  MPD believes that the public interest in thoroughly investigating this matter outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the records at this time.\r\n\r\nTherefore your request is denied because it is the subject of a pending investigation or an ongoing prosecution, which would be hindered by the release of this police record. After the case is resolved, you may resubmit your request. If you do decide to resubmit your request, please reference CASE NUMBER 232980132.\r\n\r\nThis determination is subject to review by mandamus action under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1), or upon an application to the Wisconsin Attorney General or the Milwaukee County Corporation Counsel.\r\n\nSergeant Jason Kotarak\r\nOpen Records Section\r\nMilwaukee Police Department",

Meade, MD 20755-6248\r\n\r\nSubject: Freedom of Information Act Request: Analysis of Prolific and High-Profile FOIA Requesters\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), I am requesting records related to prolific and high-profile individuals or entities who have submitted FOIA requests to the National Security Agency.\r\n\r\nSpecifics of the Request:\r\n\r\nRecords Detailing FOIA Requests: Logs or databases detailing the number and nature of FOIA requests submitted by identified prolific or high-profile requesters from January 1, 2020, to the present.\r\n\r\nReports and Analyses: Documents including reports, memos, or analyses regarding the handling, processing, or impact of these requests.\r\n\r\nInternal Guidelines and Policies: Documents addressing the management and categorization of requests from these specific categories of requesters.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence: Any correspondence related to the processing or policy-making for these requesters.\r\n\r\nLegal Precedents Supporting this Request:\r\n\r\nNLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978): The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a broad interpretation of FOIA to ensure disclosure of government information.\r\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998): The D.C. Circuit held that non-commercial requesters should not bear the full cost of FOIA processing, supporting my request for a fee waiver.\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989): The Court recognized the public interest in understanding government activities.\r\nFee Waiver Justification:\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The public interest standard for fee waivers, affirmed in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, applies here. The disclosure of the requested information contributes significantly to public understanding of the NSA's handling of FOIA requests, particularly from prolific or high-profile requesters. This request is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Appeal Process:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A), I expect a response to this request within 20 business days. In case of denial or partial denial, please provide a detailed justification, citing specific exemptions as established in Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your compliance within the stipulated timeframe as mandated by FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a broad interpretation of FOIA to ensure disclosure of government information.\r\nThe D.C. Circuit in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998), held that non-commercial requesters should not bear the full cost of FOIA processing, supporting my request for a fee waiver.\r\nIn Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Court recognized the public interest in understanding government activities, underscoring the importance of the requested information.\r\nFee Waiver Justification:\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The Supreme Court, in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, affirmed the public interest standard for fee waivers. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it contributes significantly to understanding the FBI's handling of FOIA requests, particularly from prolific or high-profile requesters. This request is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Appeal Process:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A), I expect a response to this request within 20 business days. In case of a denial or partial denial, I request a detailed justification, citing specific exemptions as established in Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your compliance within the stipulated timeframe, as mandated by FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\nFee Waiver Request Letter\r\nScreenshot of the KTLA Article for Reference\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

        "communication": "To:\r\nPeekskill City Clerk\r\nPeekskill City Hall\r\n840 Main Street\r\nPeekskill, NY 10566\r\nAttn: FOIA Officer\r\n\r\nSubject: New York Freedom of Information Law Request: Comprehensive Inquiry Including Accounts Receivable and Follow-Up on Previous Requests\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nUnder the New York Freedom of Information Law, I am submitting a comprehensive request for information, along with seeking detailed updates on my prior FOIA requests (dated May 29, 2023, June 2, 2023, and August 10, 2023). This request is aimed to acquire a thorough understanding of the FOIA process, decision-making criteria, and specific information about accounts receivable related to FOIA fees, in addition to information previously requested.\r\n\r\n    Detailed Update on Previous Requests:\r\n        Comprehensive status report, including any actions undertaken or pending, on my prior FOIA requests (reference numbers: Foil #259, MR 146407).\r\n        Detailed explanations for any delays, denials, or pending decisions related to these requests.\r\n\r\n    In-depth Inquiry into FOIA Process and Denied Requests:\r\n        All documents outlining the internal procedures for processing FOIA requests, with emphasis on any amendments or policy changes post my initial request on May 29, 2023.\r\n        Detailed records of the last 300 FOIA requests denied by your office since my original request, including justifications, corresponding communications, and exemption logs.\r\n\r\n    Records Concerning City Officials and Internal Communications:\r\n        Comprehensive records related to the oaths of office, employment records, and HR complaint records of currently appointed officials in the Peekskill City Clerk's Office, Police Department, and Corporation Council.\r\n        Full email correspondences and internal memos pertaining to the processing, denial, or appeal of my earlier FOIA requests #173 and #250.\r\n\r\n    Request for Accounts Receivable Information Related to FOIA Fees:\r\n        A detailed account of receivables connected to FOIA request processing fees over the past five years.\r\n        Information on the policies and procedures regarding the calculation, billing, and collection of FOIA fees, including any instances of waived or reduced fees.\r\n\r\nI emphasize the need for transparency and adherence to legal standards in processing these requests. In accordance with legal precedents (Konigsberg v. Coughlin, Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine), I assert that neither the size nor the perceived administrative burden should impede access to information.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of this request be denied, I request a detailed justification for each refusal, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and an exemption log as established by Vaughn v. Rosen and Fisher v. United States Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with legal obligations outlined in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Department of Defense, please ensure the preservation of records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the requested information electronically. If there are costs exceeding $200 for searching or copying these records, please inform me prior to fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nI await your response within the 20-business-day period as prescribed by the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this important matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter \r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n\r\n    Fee Waiver Request Letter)\r\n    Copies of previous FOIA request correspondences (for reference)",
