Records Requested\r\n\r\nI request all records, including cables, meeting logs, attendee rosters, security manifests, photographic evidence, open-source video collection or dissemination or internal briefing summaries, that discuss or list the following individuals as participants, attendees, or delegates at SPIEF 2015:\r\n\r\nJoseph Mifsud (linked to the Russian International Affairs Council).\r\n\r\nJeffrey Epstein (specifically seeking verification of his travel to St. Petersburg during the forum window).\r\n\r\nAnton Andreyev (representing Vdolg.ru or the Roscongress Foundation).\r\n\r\nDaria Timoshenkova (aka Daria Aslanova, representing Vdolg.ru or Roscongress).\r\n\r\nII. Specific Inquiry\r\n\r\nI am seeking to determine if these four individuals were present at the same forum events, specifically within the \"Young Leaders Forum,\" the \"Fintech/IT Innovation\" pavilions, or the plenary sessions organized by the Roscongress Foundation.\r\n\r\nIII. Keyword Search Parameters\r\n\r\nTo facilitate a comprehensive search of electronic records, cables, photo archives and internal databases, I request that the following keywords be used:\r\n\r\nEntities: \"Vdolg.ru\", \"Vdolg\", \"\u0412\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\", \"Roscongress\", \"SPIEF 2015\", \"Young Leaders Forum\", \"P2P lending Russia\".\r\n\r\nIndividuals (Phonetic/Aliases): \"Mifsud\", \"Jeffrey Epstein\", \"Andreyev, Anton\", \"Andreev, Anton\", \"Timoshenkova, Darya\", \"Timoshenkova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Darya\", \"\u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u044f \u0410\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical/Operational: \"INN 7714808861\", \"Project Lakhta\", \"Information Operations St. Petersburg\", \"Identity Harvesting\", \"Digital Sovereignty Forum\".\r\n\r\nIII. Targeted Offices\r\n\r\nPlease search the records of the National Security Council (NSC), the Office of the National Security Advisor, and any \"Spot Reports\" or cables shared by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (specifically the Political-Economic and Regional Security sections).\r\n\r\nNote: Of special interest is the possible convergence of Epstein, Mifsud, Andreyev and Timoshenkova in one event. \r\n\r\nAndreyev and Timoshenkova were pioneers in Russian FinTech and used their expertise to create the financial infrastructure that assisted the Kremlin's 2016 election interference efforts. The Epstein files includes several documents which detail Epstein's interest in attending the networking event and hobnobbing with young Russians in the financial sector. Here is an example: https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01191262.pdf\r\n\r\nPlain language: If Epstein was at this event, documentation of it by the U.S. government would have likely been generated. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Obama Presidential Library and for the library's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Her name is spelled \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0647\u064a\u062f in Arabic. Her death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find her France24 obituary at the following link: https://www.france24.com/en/video/20260219-leila-shahid-first-female-palestinian-ambassador-dies-in-france-at-76\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester.
