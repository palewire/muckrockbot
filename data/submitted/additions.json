Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law. \r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted this year. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
