        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo Robbie Goldstein, MD, PhD, Commissioner, Department of Public Health\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, MA G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am formally requesting records from the MA Department of Public Health, for any documentation of expert and/or public comment or complaints regarding health and safety concerns pertaining to 'smart meters' or \"advanced metering functionality,\" dating from January 2014 to present.\r\n\r\nPlease note it is my understanding that rulings have stated that text messages count as public records as do emails sent on personal email accounts to conduct work-related business.\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76 and Feb 2014 Panel Hearings:\r\n\r\nFor reference, in late February of 2014, the MA DPU held panel hearings regarding comments received in response to \"D.P.U. 12-76-A December 23, 2013, Investigation by the Department of Public Utilities on its own Motion into Modernization of the Electric Grid,\" issued by Chair Berwick. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9254075\r\n\r\nPeter Valberg of Gradient testified in person before the DPU for the panel hearings in Feb. 0f 2014, but no written testimony by Valberg was posted publicly.\r\n\r\nThe DPU received commentary and complaints from both health experts and from the public that the agency was relying on testimony, public relations, and marketing claims from a compromised, pro-industry, mercenary product defense expert, Peter Valberg of Gradient, who also works for the tobacco industry.\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76-B: June 2014\r\n\r\nFollowing the February hearings, on June 12 of 2014, the DPU issued order 12-76-B, https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9241637 in which it discounted health concerns, referencing \"Gradient,\" and \"another commenter\" but not identifying Peter Valberg as the source.\r\n\r\nThe public record demonstrates that instead of consulting independent experts with health expertise and liability, the DPU promoted the opinion of Peter Valberg of Gradient Corporation, who did not file any written testimony. Therefore, the source of some claims included in MA 12-762-B discounting smart meter health and safety issues is unclear.\r\n\r\nThe MA DPU smart meter order 12-76-B made the unprecedented claim that exposure guidelines are adequate to protect against both thermal and non-thermal impacts of radio frequency exposure. The circumstances surrounding how that gross misrepresentation was incorporated in the MA DPU order, which then could be referenced in other proceedings, have not been addressed. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846\r\n\r\n2023 Pending Smart Meter Deployment by Investor-Owned Utilities:\r\n\r\nMA investor-owned utilities have been authorized by the MA DPU to deploy smart meters in their service territories. At the same time, health harm and disability has been reported in other jurisdictions where the meters were installed, including California, now extending for over a decade.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this FOIA request is:\r\n\r\n1. to determine whether or not the MA DPU is basing its health and safety justification for this investment decision by ratepayers on the 2014 testimony, or whether the DPU has revisited and/or monitored developments in RF/EMF research, including the court ruling requiring the FCC to justify why it has not revisited its 1996 exposure guidelines. Note that documented smart meter injuries were included in evidence submitted to the court. Testimony submitted to the DPU for https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846 and https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12639808 outlines this issue.\r\n\r\n2. to determine if potential smart meter vendors or utilities have disclosed the incidence of adverse health effects to the MA DPU, including the acute onset of electrical sensitivity and/or if the MA DPU has accounted for the consequences to vulnerable ratepayers in its business case.\r\n\r\n3. to determine if the DPU's plan for utilities to offer an 'opt out' is based on accurate assumptions, and whether or not it will adequately protect all ratepayers\r\n\r\n4. to determine what correspondence/if any, took place between the Dept of Health and the DPU regarding the safety of wireless smart utility meters and health, including complaints reported during the Worcester National Grid smart meter pilot program which was financed by ratepayers, which utilized Itron meters in a mesh network.\r\n\r\n5. to determine whether or not the MA Dept of Health was aware of or concurs with claims made in the 2014 order DPU 12-76-B, including the implication that FCC limits are protective of non-thermal effects of RF exposures, or if the MA Dept of Health concurs with the implication that the plan to deploy smart meters in MA is safe.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the DPU's mission statement notes that it seeks to promote safety, security, reliability of service, affordability, equity, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-utilities\r\n\r\nThe Department of Public Health states that, \"DPH keeps people healthy and communities strong.\" https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-health\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\nI request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.
