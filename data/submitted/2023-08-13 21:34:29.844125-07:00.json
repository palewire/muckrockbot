I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the Agency contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request productions of all emails in native MICROSOFT .pst (personal storage table) format which allows for a virtually infinite number of emails to be produced in a single digital file, providing for economy and convenience. If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled into a single digital .pdf file.\r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available, or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully I decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite me to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I recently received an email from Google's Legal Investigations Support Division that said in part: \"Google received and responded to legal process issued by the Rockland County District Attorney's Office compelling the release of information related to your Google account. A court order previously prohibited Google from notifying you of the legal process. We are now permitted to disclose the receipt of the legal process to you. The agency reference number or case number on the legal process is RCDA-21-00340.\"\r\n\r\nThis email would have been from a missing person case I did private research into. I was more than a little surprised to learn that Rockland County used subpoena powers to compel Google to pass over information about my account. Considering that Google provided information about the request from Rockland County, then there is no longer an active investigation and the emails are a public record.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Robert Delaware: \r\nThis is an automatic, computer generated message.\u00a0\u00a0Your FOIL request to the County of Rockland was\u00a0submitted on 8/10/2023 and given the reference number R007782-081023 for tracking purposes.\u00a0 The Department that receives your FOIL request will send you a formal acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days. Records Requested: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny emails to or from a Rockland County District Attorney's email address to uslawenforcement@google.com regarding case number: RCDA-21-00340 and my personal email address of RobbyDelaware1979@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nHello. I recently received an email from Google's Legal Investigations Support Division that said in part: \"Google received and responded to legal process issued by the Rockland County District Attorney's Office compelling the release of information related to your Google account. A court order previously prohibited Google from notifying you of the legal process. We are now permitted to disclose the receipt of the legal process to you. The agency reference number or case number on the legal process is RCDA-21-00340.\"\r\n\r\nThis email would have been from a missing person case I did private research into. I was more than a little surprised to learn that Rockland County used subpoena powers to compel Google to pass over information about my account. Considering that Google provided information about the request from Rockland County, then there is no longer an active investigation and the emails are a public record.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Frockland-county-district-attorney-22697%252Frockland-county-da-office-emails-to-or-from-google-regarding-my-gmail-account-150606%252F%253Femail%253Dinfo%252540rocklandcountyda.com&url_auth_token=AACOc4tANBz3q3rgcaYMU60dZ-Y%3A1qTyiQ%3AR6ymdahlvlahjEEDhAOSbciRlcfw5mllEI_v2404JYU\" \r\nTo monitor the progress of or to update this request, please log into the Public Records System.",

Finally please provide all information, mandated under federal contracts, that TPAs collect in their efforts to identify, track, trend, and report interventions to resolve any potential or identified quality issues. \r\n\r\nThe creation and collection of this information is detailed in recent Congressional testimony here:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.house.gov/meetings/VR/VR03/20220714/114988/HHRG-117-VR03-Wstate-LaPuzM-20220714-U1.pdf\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJasper Craven",
