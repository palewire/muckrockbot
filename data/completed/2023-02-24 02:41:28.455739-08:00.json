THIS has gotten her off of DWI's, burglary of the Sheriff's shed, harassing a tv reporter and other people, and most recently burglary of another habitation. The City of Robinson's legal representative, Lawyer Dixon, is used to protecting his other client, Sheriff McNamara from all things Sherre Johnston so it is no wonder that this request has gone on this long.  It is also why the Sheriff's department is the only Department in the State of Texas that does not have body cameras. NO body cams keep the Sheriff's people from recording Sherre screaming for Parnell. Unfortunately, Robinson, like everyone else, HAS body cams. These will prove as has been proven over and over again, that the woman has a get out of jail free cards because she's the Sheriff's girlfriend. Ask them.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request is for the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2020 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201cplease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf or hard-copy. You have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question (2020), and such responses typically did not contain native format records. Since your request is in conflict with the District's production of records, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format when they were sent electronically, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses. The District retains records pursuant to the Core Retention Schedule of two years.\r\nPer RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for copies of records:\r\n1. Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of agency equipment to photocopy public records;\r\n2. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n3. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n4. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n5. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, RCW 42.56.120 authorizes the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing a first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.120(4) we are charging a 10% deposit in order to produce about 1184 records. The deposit due is $1.48, the total amount due is $14.80. Please contact me at 425-408-7605 to coordinate a deposit. If I do not hear from you by January 10, 2023, the District will close your request consistent with RCW 42.56.120.\r\nIf you have any questions I can be reached at 425-408-7605.\r\n\u200b\nSincerely,\r\n\u200b\r\nDoug Hale\r\nExecutive Director of Human Resources\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a pleasant day.\r\n\r\nElaine Gisle\r\nExecutive Administrative Assistant\r\nHuman Resources  |  Northshore School District\r\nPhone: 425.408.7621<callto:425.408.7621>",

If your District produced records in a particular electronic format to a requestor, please produce the records to me in that same format. If the files were produced in paper form, please produce them to me in .pdf form.\r\n3. Retention schedule. All records should be available according to the retention schedule. This request is for records from 2020 and it is not yet 2023. Note: any records previously requested via the public records act that have yet to be produced by your district cannot be legally destroyed and ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THECORE RETENTION SCHEDULE. I suspect based on various outstanding records requests I see pending with your district, (and the fact that your district must retain all responses to public records requests for 2 years)  ONLY A LIMITED SUBSET OF PUBLIC RECORDS in your district can be destroyed based on the core retention schedule for the foreseeable future.

DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016) holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\nAlthough, as I stated above, you have provided some information as to your intended use of any provided records, we ask that you fill out and return the attached Commercial Purpose declaration, which includes additional questions we use to make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose(s) relating to your request. Please return the completed declaration within 30 days of today's date, or by February 24, 2023.\u00a0 We anticipate the responsive records will be available approximately 14 days from the date of receipt of a completed declaration determined to be valid.\u00a0 If responsive records become available sooner than the estimated 14-day window, we will let you know. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaurie Farnsworth \r\nSpokane Deputy City Clerk",

(The other five were Edwin Edwards, George Wallace, Jim Hunt, Bill Janklow, and Terry Branstad.) Rhodes is tied for the fourth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. As governor in 1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University campus at the request of Kent, Ohio's mayor, after the ROTC building was burned down by unknown arsonists on May 2. On May 4, four students were killed and nine others were wounded by the Guard. One victim, Dean Kahler, suffered permanent paralysis. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not required, as the subject was born over 100 years ago.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Please log in to the City of Coeur d'Alene Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the appropriate responsive documents. Per our phone conversation I have not included emails as there would be fees involved, .1. The invoices are attached. We pay Spokane Police Department not Forensic Logic. \r\n2. We do NOT use Face Match at all. We also do NOT use Shot Spotter. \r\n3. There is no record of MOU\u2019s. \r\n4. Spokane operates / maintains Coplink by Forensic Logic. They may have this information along with the company; we do not have anything like this. There are user manuals on: http://arrest.spokanepolice.org/usermanuals.html that is open to the public. Training that occurred was in a classroom setting and mostly hands-on. There were no handouts from the instructor. \r\n5. Our Policy can be downloaded at: https://www.cdaid.org/files/Police/Policies/RELEASE_20221207_T120521_Coeur_d_Alene_PD_Policy_Manual.pdf. \r\nLegacy Coplink was discontinued 2/8/2023 so that information is not available. \r\n[Public Records Request - R002488-021223\r\nThank you for your patience in awaiting this information. \r\nSincerely, \r\nCity of Coeur d'Alene",

In order of preference, I would prefer that this data be provided as: plain text with comma-separated-values (i.e., a \"CSV\" file), OpenDocument spreadsheet, Excel spreadsheet, or the native electronic format of the software from which this information is retrieved in fulfillment of my request. I specifically request that you not create a new record for me by rendering to PDF or by printing your electronic record then scanning it to make a series of images of the printed data. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\u201d We would like to clarify with you whether the list you are requesting may be used for commercial purposes. RCW Chapter 42.56 governs the disclosure of public records in Washington State. The Public Disclosure Act is generally construed liberally to promote access to public records ( RCW 42.56.030). However, RCW 42.56.070(8) specifically prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u201d. This section \u201cdoes not distinguish between different types of commercial purposes\u201d. \r\n\r\nPrior to providing you with the list you requested, please complete and return the attached Affidavit form. Once your signed Affidavit form is received, we will process your request. We will consider your request for this list as abandoned/closed unless we hear from you by February 21, 2023. \r\nPLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4) , the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4)\u00a0states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1)\u00a0states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request. Please reply to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.

With that said, however, the attached document does reflect two de-identified cases in which the Department was able to locate and determine it received collected moneys from a child support order imposed by the court for a child in the custody of the Department.  Those funds are placed into a trust/guardianship account to pay expenses on the child\u2019s behalf.\r\nFor purposes of this current request, we will consider it closed.

Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/obituaries/paul-laxalt.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This search is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

Ader: This acknowledges receipt of your February 9, 2021, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), for all records relating to the design of Challenge Coins - including indexes, depictions, guidelines, policies, proposed, accepted and rejected designs, as well as discussion, deliberation, and debate about possible designs and design policies.\u00a0 Your request was received in this office on February 9, 2021. Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \nYour request has been assigned reference number 2021-ICFO-26059. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.

We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files). \r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level. \r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area. \r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area.\r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",
