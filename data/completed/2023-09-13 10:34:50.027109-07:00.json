Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Diana Crawford does not respond to email.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************\r\n\r\nOlympia School District\r\nWashington Public Records Act Office\r\n111 Bethel Street NE\r\nOlympia, WA 98506\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 2022\r\n\r\nOLYMPIA SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2019) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2019\r\n\r\nVia email: dcrawford@osd.wednet.edu\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The CPS Cell Phone User Agreement; RESPONSE : Documents responsive to this portion of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n2. A listing of CPS Officials, including Board members, and employees who have signed a CPS Cell Phone User Agreement from July 1, 2023 to current. \r\nRESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed this portion of your request and determined that it fails to cite specific and/or existing records for review, and instead essentially seeks the answer to a question, outside the scope of the FOIA. Note that that the district does not maintain any comprehensive list of CPS officials that have signed CPS Cell Phone User Agreements from July 1, 2023 to current. In order to respond to this portion of your request, the district would be required to conduct original research in order to gather the requested information and then combine that information into a new record that is not maintained in the normal course of business in order to answer a question posed, and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 A FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989)]. Further, it has been determined that requesting a tally that a public body has not already prepared does not cite a public record for review as required under the FOIA and performing a review of records to prepare a tally constitutes preparing a new record, outside the scope of the FOIA. [Chi. Tribune Co. v. Dep't of Fin. & Prof'l Regulation, 2014 IL App (4th) 130427, 8 N.E.3d 11, 2014 Ill. App. LEXIS 120, 380 Ill. Dec. 80, 2014 WL 895023]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922). Section 1 of the FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\" In accordance with Section 1 of Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. \r\n3. A directory of CPS cell phone numbers. The directory should include the cell phone number, employee or Board member who uses the cell phone number and the position title of the employee/official. \r\nRESPONSE : Documents responsive to this portion of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Cell phone numbers have been redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(c) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P043591-091123.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny correspondence or records related to the New York Times story ( https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html ) which reveals that the Department of Homeland Security has flown aircraft over at least fifteen American cities to perform surveillance and law enforcement support for activities relating to protests, demonstrations, and other related issues in the cities during those events. This should include any requests or responses to or from the New York Times itself, as well as responses to and from the Department of Homeland Security or related agency. This data that I am seeking is held by a mixture of agencies related to the Department of Homeland Security including but not limited to the Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine operations.\r\n \r\nThe New York Times report specified the existence of at least 270 hours of surveillance. I request copies of such surveillance recordings such as videos, photographs, radio or telephone interception information.\r\n\r\nI additionally request a detailed list of all cities which requested or were offered, or where operations were run relating to domestic demonstrations or protests, looting or rioting, or similarly related events.\r\n\r\nI am additionally writing to independently request contemporary FAA registration information such as agency name, addresses, ADS-B beacon information, Mode-S transponder identification, FAA tail numbers, as well as the make, model, year of production, and serial numbers for each aircraft. Aircraft should be understood to include helicopters, drones, airplanes, dirigibles, and any other vehicle - man or unmanned -  used for these operations or for operations which would, could, or did incidentally collect surveillance data on any activities in cities with protests or demonstrations during the months of May, 2020 and June, 2020. This includes but is not limited to operations above New York City (New York), Buffalo (New York), Minneapolis (Minnesota), Del Rio (Texas), Dayton (Ohio), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Washington (District of Columbia), Detroit (Michigan), Sierra Vista (Arizona), Corpus Christi (Texas), Portland (Oregon), Oakland (California), Los Angeles (California), and other minor or major American cities.\r\n\r\nFor each aircraft, I am requesting all maintenance records, vendor documents, emails, as well as other correspondence regarding or related to the aircraft within the last five years as well as any additional equipment attached to any of the aircraft used during the months of May 2020 and June 2020 relating to the demonstrations or related events. For example, if a Harris Corporation's cell site simulator is installed in the aircraft, even temporarily, I request information about this equipment, and its use during the specified time period. \r\n\r\nFinally, I am also seeking information about the Department of Homeland Security's \"Big Pipe\" program. I request all documents, emails, slides, training materials and other communications relating to the Big Pipe program. Furthermore, I request a list of which other federal agencies have access, access and audit logs about their use as well as the point person or contact information for the responsible person at their respective agency.\r\n\r\nThis information is part of a journalistic research project involving the Seattle Privacy Coalition.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

Note that the district does not maintain any comprehensive list of schools that the listed vendors have served. In order to respond to this portion of your request, the district would be required to conduct original research by reviewing records maintained by several departments in order to determine which schools were served and then combine that information into a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 A FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989)]. Further, it has been determined that requesting a tally that a public body has not already prepared does not cite a public record for review as required under the FOIA and performing a review of records to prepare a tally constitutes preparing a new record, outside the scope of the FOIA. [Chi. Tribune Co. v. Dep't of Fin. & Prof'l Regulation, 2014 IL App (4th) 130427, 8 N.E.3d 11, 2014 Ill. App. LEXIS 120, 380 Ill. Dec. 80, 2014 WL 895023]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922). Section 1 of the FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\" In accordance with Section 1 of Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. 2) Copies of all invoices from America Scores Chicago, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and SGA Youth and Family Services from the 2020-2021 fiscal year, 2021-2022 fiscal year and 2022-2023 fiscal year to date for each school which they serve. 3) Copies of records of payments by CPS/Chicago Board of Education to America Scores Chicago, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and SGA Youth and Family Services for the above noted time frames. I want the actual bills as well as proof of payment by the district or school, as the case may be. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to these portions of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Financial information, including EIN and bank account numbers of nonpublic entities, has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b), which exempts from release private information. Certain redactions have been made pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a) and the corresponding 105 ILCS 5/34-18.5(b) which prohibits the release of background check information. The assigned location of safe passage workers has been redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(v) which exempts from release, in pertinent part, \u201csecurity measures [including] details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(v). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a definitive contract (award ID: HQ003422C0094) awarded to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8). This contract has an action date of August 22, 2022, and is funded by the Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security for support services in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being done by AARO and its contractors. During an April 19, 2023 hearing of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, AARO director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated AARO would need additional authorization from Congress to begin counterintelligence work, but given that Sancorp's contract with AARO started in 2022, prior to that hearing, and Sancorp lists on its website previous work in the field of counterintelligence, there is a possibility AARO may already be engaged in counterintelligence work without Congressional authorization. Sancorp's contract with AARO would help clarify this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk of interfering with ongoing operations or disclosure of sensitive materials. Sancorp already lists the contract on their publicly-accessible website: https://www.sancorpconsulting.com/_files/ugd/7aeb19_0c37a59d213b4d68a043ef83b56edc9a.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear Public Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request for public records under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).\r\n\r\nUnder SB 978, a law passed in 2018, \"each local law enforcement agency shall conspicuously post on their Internet Web sites all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials that would otherwise be available to the public if a request was made pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\"* I was unable to locate the Amtrak Police Department documents on its website. \r\n\r\nPursuant to CPRA, I request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials in use by the Amtrak Police Department\r\n\r\nIf these records are already available online, please provide me with the direct links to them. Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format.If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**:\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.The California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.I can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.Respectfully,Stanford University LibrariesRelevant links* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN\u00a7ionNum=13650* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#View request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Famtrak-police-department-19688%252Fsb-978-policiesurl-125308%252F%253Femail%253Dfoiarequests%252540amtrak.com&url_auth_token=AABtxl2F7AhilVfARqjDgIMWuWY%3A1nNJ3t%3ABRJuMSZ096VTWon--K0RtnhUGcsWXUKwgAASKTY_o2cIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:  JGLPVXUWAttachments:\u2022 Amtrak_Police_Department_of_the_United_States_of_America_Signed1Filed via MuckRock.comE-mail (Preferred): 125308-26319874@requests.muckrock.com.

A copy of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) bearing tracking number SED MOU: 018-015 between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the City University of New York - Asian American/Asian Research Institute (AAARI/CUNY). This MOU was signed by Joyce Moy, Executive Director of AAARI at CUNY, on August 2, 2018, and was countersigned by Elizabeth R. Berlin, Executive Deputy Commissioner of NYSED, on July 30, 2018.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of the amended MOU (Amendment #1) to the aforementioned MOU. This amended MOU was signed by Joyce Moy on February 13, 2020, and by Phyllis D. Morris, CFO of NYSED, on January 31, 2020.\r\n\r\n3. All communications, including but not limited to emails, letters, and memos, between the named signature parties (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris) related to the MOU and its amendment. Please note that email metadata, such as sender, recipient, date, and subject line, is considered responsive factual data and should be included in the disclosure, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\n4. All cash receipts, invoices, and payments received or disbursed related to the funds specified in the MOU and its amendment, as well as any related to the work product or completion of the MOU but borne by CUNY.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with third parties, subcontractors, or external entities to AAARI/CUNY related to the MOU and its amendment. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of any and all work product and interim work product viewed by outside parties, including NYSED, subcontractors, advisors, consultants, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the advisory opinions FOIL-AO-19160, FOIL-AO-18321, and FOIL-AO-17725, even if the content of certain communications is exempt from disclosure under POL \u00a787(2)(g), the factual information about the communication itself, such as the sender, recipient, date, and subject line, should still be disclosed. This metadata does not typically contain deliberative or advisory content, but rather factual information about the communication itself. Therefore, I request that this factual information be disclosed in response to my FOIL request, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\nI would like to highlight the urgency of this request in light of the ongoing legislative discussions around Senate Bill S1402, which seeks to amend education law in relation to culturally responsive education and curriculum. The records requested are directly relevant to the public understanding of the state's efforts in this area, particularly the work of NYSED and AAARI/CUNY under the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to remind you of the retention requirements under the New York State Archives' LGS-1 schedule. Records that are subject to a FOIL request must be retained until the request has been fully resolved, including any potential appeal process.\r\n\r\nIf any record has been denied in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the law. I expect the request to be filled within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGiven the relevance of these records to ongoing legislative discussions and public interest, I kindly request that you expedite the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance with this matter.\r\n\r\nNB: You can find reference to the MOU and Amendment Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_VK1ACtp.pdf and Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_Amended_4VCegX6.pdf respectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

I am writing in response to your letter dated June 14, 2023, acknowledging the receipt of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request, and the subsequent extension letter dated July 13, 2023.\r\n\r\nI understand that the City University of New York (CUNY) University Central Office is currently conducting a diligent search for the requested records. I appreciate your efforts in this regard and acknowledge the complexity of the task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential for delays in the process. To mitigate this, I kindly request a rolling release of documents as they are found and reviewed. This would allow me to begin reviewing the information that is readily available while you continue your search for the remaining records.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request for more specific parameters for items #3 and #5, I propose the following:\r\n\r\nFor item #3, let's limit the time period to August 1, 2018, through February 29, 2021, which covers the signing of the original MOU and its amendment. The search terms could include the names of the signatories (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris), \"MOU\", \"Amendment\", \"SED MOU: 018-015\", and \"NYSED\".\r\n\r\nFor item #5, the same time period and search terms could apply. As for specific individuals from AAARI/CUNY, I would suggest starting with Joyce Moy, as she signed both the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you acknowledge receipt of this response promptly and provide an updated timeline for when I can expect to receive the first batch of documents. I understand that these processes can take time, and I appreciate your commitment to ensuring a thorough review of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",

The officer asked for a specific time period, search terms, and specific individuals from \"AAARI/CUNY\" by COB June 28, 2023, or else CUNY University Central Office would deny requests #3 and #5 as overly broad.\r\n\r\nI believe this response constitutes an arbitrary denial of access and a willful attempt to avoid responding to my request. The deadline of June 28, 2023, appears to be an attempt to limit the scope of my request without conducting a detailed search, which is contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nMy original request, I believe, was reasonably described and in compliance with the FOIL. Furthermore, I have recently responded to the Records Access Officer's request for more specific parameters in a manner that is accommodating and within the bounds of reasonableness.\r\n\r\nI am appealing this decision on the grounds that it is a violation of the Freedom of Information Law, specifically Public Officers Law, Article 6, which guarantees the public's right to access government records.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that this appeal be reviewed promptly, and that the decision to impose an arbitrary deadline be reconsidered. I am also forwarding a copy of this appeal to the Committee on Open Government for their review.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

Original Request (June 7, 2023): Submitted as per the details outlined above.\r\n2. Acknowledgment and Request to Split (June 14, 2023): Agency acknowledged the request and asked for additional information for requests #3 and #5. The request to split was accepted, and additional information was provided.\r\n3.

Appeal (July 17, 2023): An appeal was filed, arguing against arbitrary denial of access.\r\n5. Response to Appeal (August 7, 2023): Appeal was denied, and the response provided detailed reasoning.\r\n6. Extension Letter (August 16, 2023): Extension until September 18, 2023, was notified.\r\n\r\nStatutory Timelines:\r\n- Response Deadline: The current response deadline is set for September 18, 2023.\r\n- Appeal Timeline: The appeal was filed and responded to within the statutory timelines.\r\n\r\nRequested Exemptions and Justifications:\r\n- Exemption for Delay: Justification provided was the need for additional time to review records for applicable exemptions, legal privileges, and responsiveness.\r\n\r\nCounterpoints to Exemptions:\r\n- Exemption for Delay:\r\n  - Counterpoint: While we understand the need for a thorough review, the extension should be reasonable and in line with the public's right to timely access. The specific reasons for the delay should be clearly articulated, and continuous updates should be provided.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that the agency adhere to the statutory timelines and provide a prompt and comprehensive response to the FOIL request. Should there be any further delays, exemptions, or denials, I request clear and detailed justifications in accordance with the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll records within the jurisdiction of the NASA related to, within the time frame of 2008 to 2019, with respect to this criteria and article referenced:\r\n\r\nTo preface, see this article: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-takes-a-cue-from-silicon-valley-to-hatch-artificial-intelligence-technologies\r\n\r\n1. Records/documents that describe and detail the machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms applied by NASA in reference to WASP-12b, an exoplanet discovered in 2008. Authors are included in the article which likely communicated with NASA, as well as NASA's Frontier Development Lab (FDL) itself. Which is mentioned explicitly are: Bayesian neural networks and Random Forests.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore, I request the code and program specifications with these machine learning algorithms and potentially others were employed by NASA in their endeavors to analyze the dataset, based on NASA's Hubble Telescope, involving the atmosphere of WASP-12b among possibly other features of the exoplanet. I request the code be in its original unaltered form and its original programming language excluding the dataset itself. However, I request to know the features relevant in the analysis of WASP-12b.\r\n\r\n3. To quote the article, \"While the technique developed by this team is still in development, other FDL technologies have already been adopted in the real world. By 2017, FDL participants developed a machine learning program that could quickly create 3D models of nearby asteroids, accurately estimating their shapes, sizes, and spin rates. This information is critical to NASA\u2019s efforts to detect and deflect threatening asteroids from Earth.\" - Therefore, I wish to know the same as (1) and (2) but within the context of the machine learning program mentioned in the creation of 3D asteroids, while estimating their shapes, sizes, and spine rates as specified in the article.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

If it is easier, you may break my request into two parts: one for ECF and one for CRS, search for \"Trump Organization\" regardless of whether the records was of investigative interest, and produce the records separately and I will make the comparison myself.
