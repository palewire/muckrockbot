        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the 'Uniform Probate Court Rules' (including Rule 1. Preliminary Provisions; Rule 4. Court Records), I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) Who is the ADA Coordinator for the Probate Court of Lamar County?\r\n2) What is the PROCESS FOR REQUESTING disability accommodations through the Probate Court of Lamar County? \r\n3) Provide a WRITTEN POLICY of the Probate Court of Lamar County's ADA/Section 504 policy on the accommodation process (as required by the 'Uniform Probate Court Rules' Rule 4. Court Records). \r\n4) What is the POLICY FOR FILING FORMAL COMPLAINTS when the Probate Court of Lamar County ignores a disabled person's request for accommodations? \r\n\r\nBased on information received from SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, the Probate Court of Lamar County has failed to adequately respond to requests for disability accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The ADA protects ALL participants, including parties, witnesses, jurors, observers, attendees at events, and attorneys (collectively referred to as \"Parties\" going forward) (See  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101; See Prakel v. Indiana, App. F, p. 9.; See Mosier v. Kentucky, App. F, p. 10). \r\n\r\nIndividuals \"with disabilities SHALL NOT, by reason of their disability, be discriminated against, or be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of services and programs conducted by the courts\" (See 'A Meaningful Opportunity to Participate: A Handbook for Georgia Court Officials on Courtroom Accessibility for Individuals with Disabilities'). Since early 2023, it appears multiple requests for disability accommodations have been submitted to the Probate Court of Lamar County without any further directions, guidance, or equal access. Consequently, SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS have reported being unable to gain equal access to the Probate Court of Lamar County. Several Parties requiring equal access, effective communication, and accommodations have been ignored often causing harm to those individuals. \r\n\r\nTHIS REQUIREMENT APPLIES TO ALL COMMUNICATION-RELATED COURT ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATION INCLUDING: HEARINGS, JURY DELIBERATIONS, WEBSITES, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS FORMS AND DOCUMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, COURT DECISIONS AND ORDERS, SIGNAGE, AND OTHERS (A Meaningful Opportunity to Participate, p. 19). For example, communicating with Parties via email who cannot use a telephone, clerk or other staff members handwriting information in forms for individuals who have physical impairments, and more. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n*The Probate Court of Lamar County fails to scan documents into the online system available to all probate courts in Georgia (https://georgiaprobaterecords.com). Therefore, Parties do not have access to Lamar County Probate records. \r\n     >When the Probate Court of Lamar County provides paper records to Parties, they cannot be scanned or recognized by screen reader technology, as required by Title III of the ADA, and several other laws. \r\n\r\n*The ADA Title II regulations mandate that all US state and local government websites and mobile applications meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at Level A and AA.\r\n     >The Probate Court of Lamar County does NOT comply with the WCAG guidelines, as required by Title II of the ADA /Section 504 (https://www.lamarcountyga.com/departments/probate-court).\r\n     >This prevents Parties from being able to contact the Probate Court of Lamar County. \r\n\r\nThis is another GOOD FAITH attempt to exhaust as many potential administrative remedies to gain equal access, effective communication, and accommodations for multiple Parties that have been excluded from the Probate Court of Lamar County over the last two years on the basis of disability. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court decided in Tennessee v. Lane in 2004 (above, footnote 1) that states are subject to lawsuits filed in federal court under Title II for money damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief; Congress had appropriately abrogated sovereign immunity when it enacted the ADA, specifically as to \u201cjudicial services.\u201d See case description, App. F, p. 1. \r\n\r\nTO CONCLUDE AND REITERATE: \r\n\r\n1) Who is the ADA Coordinator for the Probate Court of Lamar County?\r\n2) What is the process for requesting disability accommodations through the Probate Court of Lamar County? \r\n3) Provide a written policy of the Probate Court of Lamar County's ADA/Section 504 policy on the accommodation process (as required by the 'Uniform Probate Court Rules' Rule 4. Court Records). \r\n\r\nNOTE: There should be no fees associated with fulfilling this request, as Public Entities are not allowed to place surcharges on attempts to request legal disability accommodations. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling this request to document another example of surcharges being placed on disabled Parties attempting to have equal access to the Probate Court of Lamar County. This request should preferably be fulfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. A response from someone within three days is expected. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDisabled Individuals attempting to gain basic access to Lamar County Courts.",

Appropriate UC Office of the President offices are being notified of your request. Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production for all new requests is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is no central repository for all University records. The identification and collection of potentially responsive records is only the first step in the CPRA response process. The collected records must be reviewed by this office to ensure that they are in fact responsive to your request and to assess whether any legal privileges or exemptions from disclosure are applicable and whether redactions may be required to protect individuals\u2019 rights to privacy. Please also bear in mind that we are concurrently fulfilling numerous other requests, many of which were received before yours and that we generally process requests in the order in which they are received.\r\n\r\nAlthough the requested records have not yet been fully gathered and reviewed, it is possible that the requested material may contain information exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA. However, this is not a determination that the requested records are necessarily exempt from disclosure. This office will provide you with a status update after the requested records have been thoroughly reviewed.\r\n\r\nInquiries about this CPRA request should refer to CPRA #25-0128.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nUCOP Public Records\r\nUC, Office of the President\r\n1111 Franklin St.\r\nOakland, CA 94607\r\npra@ucop.edu<mailto:pra@ucop.edu>",

You requested the following: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAny and all personnel records and files related to complaints, misconduct, and disciplinary actions involving officer Kevin McLaughlin of the Bellingham Police Department. \r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting copies of the following documents: \r\n\r\nAny formal complaints filed against officer McLaughlin either by members of the public, or by fellow officers or his superiors. \r\n\r\nAny internal investigations conducted in response to these complaints or recorded misconduct, including all findings, communications, and conclusions. \r\n\r\nAny disciplinary actions taken against officer McLaughlin as a result of these complaints or misconduct, including but not limited to suspension records, reprimands, and training records related to corrective actions. \r\n\r\nAny records detailing the status, rank, and assignment of officer McLaughlin within the Bellingham Police Department. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The City needs additional time to locate and assemble the records requested and to determine whether any of the requested records are exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request.  For these reasons, I estimate that the City will need approximately 4 weeks in order to respond to your request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the police department may also exercise its right to provide the responsive records in installments as they become available. \r\n\r\nYou may contact Police Records at (360) 778-8700 if you have any questions about this request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nBellingham Police Records Division",
