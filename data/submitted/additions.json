CPS hires an independent firm to conduct the facility assessments. Assessment teams are made up of experienced building professionals including professional engineers, registered architects, and certified project managers.\"\r\n\r\nPlease provide records sufficient to show if and when these assessments have been performed since 2020, and if performed, at which schools. Please note that I am not requesting the contents of these assessments. I am requesting records documenting that they occurred. \r\n\r\nRequested information includes, but is not limited to: the schools assessed, the date(s) of assessment, and the firm(s) which performed them.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnthony Moser",
