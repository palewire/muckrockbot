Electronic records must not be printed and scanned as that does not constitute a \"copy\" (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098). You must justify every withholding of any information in writing.  You must provide footnotes or other clear references to justify each and every redaction (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098).  If you do not provide correct copies of electronic records or do not justify by footnote or other clear reference each and every redaction, we will ask SOTF to file Official Misconduct charges against Director Henderson before the Ethics Commission, as we did against Chief Scott in SOTF 19112, pursuant to SFAC 67.34.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a publicly- viewable mailbox. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous",

DO NOT CLICK links or attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. If you believe this is SPAM please forward to SPAM@bcso.us.\r\n\r\nHello Jonathan Colon,\r\nThank you for contacting us. We have successfully received your public records request and will respond as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRequests for public records are processed in the order that they are received and can take up to 30 business days to be fulfilled and/or invoiced. Processing time may be longer due to the nature and extent of the request. Furthermore, the processing time may be affected by other business processes that have statutory and/or court ordered time limits for completion and, therefore, will take priority over a public records request.\r\n\r\nShould your request require extensive clerical or supervisory costs, you will be provided an invoice for the estimated costs associated with your request; this estimate must be paid prior to the start of any records production.\r\n\r\nThe result for some requests requiring extensive clerical or supervisory labor may be negative and BCSO may not have records responsive to the public records request. Deposits will not be returned for labor expended researching requests even if the search produces no responsive records.\r\n\r\nPublic records requests will be closed if the requesting party fails to pay the estimated or final invoice, or fails to respond to clarification inquiries pertaining to a public records request thirty (30) days following the issuance of the invoice or clarification inquiry. If you have previously received an estimated or final invoice and you have not paid the costs associated with that request, BCSO will not provide records for subsequent requests until such time as the past due amounts have been paid. After payment is received, the outstanding request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request. If a response to an inquiry for clarification is made after 30 days from the inquiry, the request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request.\r\n\r\nPlease note: Schedule of Fees for Public Records Reproduction Records Check: $2.00 / per last name inquiry Local record of those persons booked into the Brevard County Jail. Case Report: $0.15 / single sided copy if request is 10 pages or more $.20 / double-sided copy By Mail \u2013 Add self-addressed stamped envelope CD/DVD: $1.00 / each (plus service charge if applicable) Due to security concerns, we will not accept any CD/DVD, memory stick, or any other device for duplication. Service Charge: Requestors will be charged for employee\u2019s labor cost when the request takes 15 or more minutes to fulfill. Any specialty costs, to include technological resources or extensive research time will be subject to further expense. Advance deposit may be required for extensive requests.

        "communication": "Thank you for contacting us. We have successfully received your public records request and will respond as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRequests for public records are processed in the order that they are received and can take up to 30 business days to be fulfilled and/or invoiced. Processing time may be longer due to the nature and extent of the request. Furthermore, the processing time may be affected by other business processes that have statutory and/or court ordered time limits for completion and, therefore, will take priority over a public records request.\r\n\r\nShould your request require extensive clerical or supervisory costs, you will be provided an invoice for the estimated costs associated with your request; this estimate must be paid prior to the start of any records production.\r\n\r\nThe result for some requests requiring extensive clerical or supervisory labor may be negative and BCSO may not have records responsive to the public records request. Deposits will not be returned for labor expended researching requests even if the search produces no responsive records.\r\nPublic records requests will be closed if the requesting party fails to pay the estimated or final invoice, or fails to respond to clarification inquiries pertaining to a public records request thirty (30) days following the issuance of the invoice or clarification inquiry. If you have previously received an estimated or final invoice and you have not paid the costs associated with that request, BCSO will not provide records for subsequent requests until such time as the past due amounts have been paid. After payment is received, the outstanding request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request. If a response to an inquiry for clarification is made after 30 days from the inquiry, the request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request.\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n\r\nSchedule of Fees for Public Records Reproduction\r\n\r\nRecords Check:\r\n$2.00 / per last name inquiry\r\nLocal record of those persons booked into the Brevard County Jail.\r\n\r\nCase Report:\r\n$0.15 / single sided copy if request is 10 pages or more\r\n$.20 / double-sided copy\r\nBy Mail \u2013 Add self-addressed stamped envelope\r\n\r\nCD/DVD:\r\n$1.00 / each (plus service charge if applicable)\r\nDue to security concerns, we will not accept any CD/DVD, memory stick, or any other device for duplication.\r\n\r\nService Charge:\r\nRequestors will be charged for employee\u2019s labor cost when the request takes 15 or more minutes to fulfill. Any specialty costs, to include technological resources or extensive research time will be subject to further expense. Advance deposit may be required for extensive requests.\r\n\r\nMethods of Payment\r\nIndividuals may pay for records reproduction fees by one of the following: Money Order/Cashier Check, Cash, Business Check, Credit Card.

Code Ann. \u00a725-61-3(f) and Miss. Code Ann. \u00a725-61-12(2): \u201cInvestigative reports\u201d\r\n  *   Miss. Code Ann. \u00a725-61-12(3): personal information of victims\r\n\r\nPlease see the below statute authorizing the MBI to investigation all OIS cases in the State of MS:\r\n\u00a7 45-1-6.

The Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is authorized to retain on a contractual basis such persons as he shall deem necessary to detect and apprehend violators of the criminal statutes of this state.\r\n  2.  Those persons contracting with the Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation pursuant to subsection (1) shall be known and hereinafter referred to as \u201cspecial contract agents.\u201d\r\n  3.  The investigative services provided for in this section shall be designed to support law enforcement efforts of state agencies and to support local law enforcement efforts.\r\n  4.  Special contract investigators shall have all powers necessary and incidental to the fulfillment of their contractual obligations, including the power of arrest when authorized by the Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.\r\n  5.  No person shall be a special contract investigator unless he is at least twenty-one (21) years of age.\r\n  6.  The Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation shall conduct a background investigation of all potential special contract investigators. All contract agents must meet the minimum standard requirements established by the Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training.\r\n  7.  Any contract pursuant to subsection (1) shall be:\r\n     *   Reduced to writing; and\r\n     *   Terminable upon written notice by either party, and shall in any event terminate one (1) year from the date of signing; and\r\n     *   Approved as to form by the Commissioner of Public Safety.\r\nSuch contracts shall not be public records and shall not be available for inspection under the provisions of a law providing for the inspection of public records as now or hereafter amended.\r\n\r\n  1.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation shall have jurisdiction to investigate all incidents of officer-involved shootings, other than shootings involving one or more members of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, resulting in injury or death occurring in the state. However, the District Attorney in the jurisdiction where such incident occurred may designate another law enforcement agency to investigate the incident if the District Attorney determines that there is a conflict with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation or that other extenuating circumstances exist. The Attorney General shall designate another law enforcement agency or task force to investigate any incident of a shooting involving one or more members of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation resulting in injury or death occurring in the state. The Attorney General\u2019s Office shall be exclusively responsible for presenting all officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death occurring in the state to the appropriate duly empaneled grand jury and, upon indictment by a grand jury, prosecuting such matters.\r\n  4.  Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this section, all contracts authorized under this section and related matters shall be made available to the Legislative Budget Office and the Department of Finance and Administration.\r\n\r\nYou will find a copy of the statute attached to this email.\r\n\r\nAfter rechecking- the four attached Capitol PD OIS are the only four we have. Also attached are the five JPD OIS redacted incident report MBI worked from 2021 to current. Couldn\u2019t be sure if you were looking at one agency or one area, and it serves no one\u2019s interest for you to have to submit another request for information at hand.\r\n\r\nAll fees associated with this request have been waived.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else with which I can assist you, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nR.E.

The entity's Primary Activity is reported as \"Development of Veteran Housing\" with a Total Income of $1,892,208.00 USD and End Of Year Assets of $4,946,563.00 USD; and it's Direct Controlling Entity is Reported as \"United States Veterans Initiative\".  Despite the entity reportedly being Organized in California, the California Secretary of State has no Reocord of any business named WLA VA BUILDING 300.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome background information regarding this Request is as follows:\r\n\r\nResponses to prior FOIA's may not have produced any land use agreements for Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home.\r\n\r\nUnited States Veterans Initiative is among entities promoted as \"Principle Developers\", which have been awarded invalid and illegal Enhanced Use Leases, Leases, Revocable Licenses and Access Agreements to privately acquire, control and sub-lease redevelopment of the WLA VA Soldiers Home for purposes including an approximately 450,000 square-foot commercial retail district (aka \"Town Center\") and other illegal uses of the Deed-Restricted WLA VA Soldiers Home in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran homelessness - on a for-profit basis over 50-99 year terms.\r\n\r\nBuilding 300 is a funtional and operational facility developed by the U.S. Federal Government at the West Los Angeles VA Soldiers Home that is under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' management.  Private developers (including United States Veterans Initiative) either intend to obtain or claim to have authorities to convert Building 300 into private property under their private control within Los Angeles County's jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nUS DVA / VA GLAHS Contractor, Concourse Federal, a company in the business of privatizing and liquidating Federal Public Land and Facilities, has at least $85,000,000.00 USD in US DVA consulting fees regarding WLA VA Soldiers Home land use - may have developed, administered and / or coordinated transactions regarding Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home.\r\n\r\nPrevailing authorities at Public Law expressly prohibit private developers from accounting for VA Facilities and land (lawfully) acquired under Enhanced Use Leases as financial collateral.  Given the legal intent of US DVA Enhanced Use Leases are to, among other things, provide cost-saving benefits to US DVA supporting the agency's efforts to care for those who bore the battle - it may be of significant concern that US DVA may have paid any lessee nearly two-million dollars in Public Funds to a disregarded entity, regarding any land use agreement for Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home.\r\n\r\nRecent FOIA's and Federal Contract databases produce no Responsive Documents for legally mandated bids, awards, SDVOSB status, competitor information, congressional reports and other related info about the so-called \"Principal Developers\".  Furthermore, the so-called Principal Developers and VA GLAHS executives primarily operate on a non-transparent and secretive basis; thus little to no additional information beyond a few concept drawings and paragraph about contemplated land use are available to provide regarding Building 300 at this time.\r\n\r\nOther so-called Principal Developers are: Thomas Safran & Associates, Century Housing Corporation and Housing Corporation of America.  Collectively with United States Veterans Initiative, the entities have Organized many California LLC's to mitigate their liabilities regarding unlawful, private WLA VA Soldiers Home redevelopment projects for-profit.  Despite such, they've yet to declare what entities will be the general partner in most to all of the projects they conspire to complete.\r\n\r\nWhile somewhat off-topic, I'll note it appears the illegal US DVA Enhanced Use Lease Agreement with so-called Principal Developers for Building 207 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home, may obligate US DVA to make an approximately $10,500,000.00 USD lump-sum cash payment to the LESSEE; despite that LESSEE already having obtained approximately $50,000,000.00 USD in Public subsidies to remodel the existing building into housing for formerly homeless senior-citizen Veterans with low incomes and HUD VASH Vouchers (as opposed to homeless Veterans risking death on U.S. streets today)... Whereat said LESSEE hasn't delivered a single unit of such housing in approximately five years.  Said Enhanced Use Lease also appears to NOT obligate the LESSEE to pay any lease fees / rents.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",

Despite the entity reportedly being Organized in California, the California Secretary of State has no Reocord of any business named WLA VA BUILDING 300.\"\r\n\r\nNearly three months later on 12/19/2022 - a \"Government Information Specialist\" for VA OIG responded with two documents:\r\n\r\n1) A letter entitled \"23-00012-FOIA Letter\" dated 12/19/2022 from VA OIG via Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthlee G. Bellamy of VA OIG Release Information Office; stating the Request was received on 12/12/2022, was assigned tracking number 23-00012-FOIA, the Requested Records are not maintained by \"we\", \"we\" did not process the request, a 10/01/2022 VA GLAHS FOIA of undisclosed Tracking Number is considered the same as VA OIG 23-00012-FOIA, the VA GLAHS FOIA of undisclosed Tracking Number was responded to by VA GLAHS on 11/10/2022 and this FOIA (23-00012-FOIA) is being closed by VA OIG without further action.\r\n\r\n2) A letter entitled \"Admin Closure Letter 23-00053-F\" dated 11/10/2022 from VA GALHS \"Acting\" VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System FOIA Officer Kevin Johnson - purportedly regarding VA GLAHS FOIA(s) Requested on 09/26/2022 and 10/04/2022 for Congressionally Mandated Annual Reports, land use agreements from 01/01/2021 onward and records pertaining to WLA VA BUILDING 300; and stating such Request(s) are administratively closed.\r\n\r\nRegarding Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home - the VA OIG is Required by Federal Public Law 114-226 as Amended, to Audit and Report on all Land Use Agreements (including all leases and enhanced use leases) regarding the WLA VA Soldiers Home.  Given WLA VA Soldiers Home Building 300 exists and is subject to a lease / land use agreement / EUL and in consideration of VA OIG's mandated performance in accordance with Public Law 114-226 - VA OIG must have Records Requested in my 10/01/2022 VA OIG FOIA that was assigned VA OIG Tracking Number 23-00012-FOIA and those Records are being unlawfully suppressed from VA OIG's False \"No Records\" Response to that FOIA...  Unless VA OIG is alternatively evidencing a negligent failure to perform under Federal Public Laws regarding land use at the US DVA's largest managed facility with the highest operating budget; namely the West Los Angeles VA Soldiers Home in Our Country's Capital of Veteran Homelessness.\r\n\r\nDespite the false VA OIG Response to 23-00012-FOIA dated 12/19/2022 purporting a VA GLAHS FOIA of undisclosed Tracking Number is somehow the same as a different FOIA Request to VA GLAHS; notice upon comparing the VA OIG letter to it's attached VA GLAHS letter of 11/10/2022; stated dates of Requests, quantity of Requests and even quantity of Requests are not the same between said letters.\r\n\r\nTo say the least this matter apparently concerns the integrity, performance and intent of VA OIG regarding Requested Information that VA OIG is Required by Federal Public Law to not only posess; but Report, Audit and Assess as well.  It's also a matter pertaining to Information that will benefit the Public and especially disabled homeless Veterans thereamong, in their ongoing efforts to thwart the longstanding criminal racket at the Soldiers Home in Our Country's Capital of Veteran Homelessness that is so frequently, consistently and thoroughly reported on by the Press for decades and counting.  Therefore I respectfully Demand VA OIG accurately, honestly and thoroughly perform in accordance with USC 5 and Public Law 114-226 as Amended by legitimately Responding to my VA OIG FOIA that was assigned VA OIG Tracking Number 23-00012-FOIA without further delay and negligence.\r\n\r\nFor your reference, copies of the aforementioned VA OIG FOIA and \"Acting\" VA GLAHS FOIA letters are attached to this correspondence.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",

If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 138 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 571 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,289 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,649 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nF: (540) 868-4391\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The emergency operations plan is confidential and thus subject to nondisclosure. NRS 388.259.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no insurance policy specifically named, referred to or that references active shooter/active assailant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, upon advice of counsel, per Nevada Revised Statute, a request must be made for an identifiable public record. It must be something that does not require the district to create data, generate new documents or organize data to create a record that does not already exist. Regarding the request for public comments related to active shooter/assailant concerns, the Carson City School District does not have a record such as what you are requesting, and creating or assembling this information would be outside of the manner in which the information is kept in our ordinary course of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the above response, the district considers the request answered and will take no further action. Thank you.\r\n\n[1510762313440_CCSDLogo.jpg]\r\n\r\nDan Davis, APR | Public Information Officer\r\nCarson City School District\r\n1402 W. King St. Carson City, NV 89703",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.

The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.

As you can imagine, producing complete copies of all public records requests received by the District and its responses to those requests between November 14, 2021 and November 14, 2021 including all abandoned requests and requests for video records takes a great deal of time. The District has worked diligently to answer your organization\u2019s original request.\r\n\r\nThe District mailed you the most recent installment to your original request on Friday, December 2nd via USPS. The tracking number is 9505 5125 9791 2336 5843 64. It should be delivered today.\r\n\r\nAs I stated previously, District policy provides that the District is not required to work on separate requests made by the same requester at the same time. Therefore the District is working on your original request and then will work to answer your request number R000175-111622 that was received by the District on November 16th. \r\n\r\nAs I stated previously, you can re-prioritize your requests. If you wish the District to move your request for JLARC records to the front, please let the District know.  Again, the District is committed to answering all five of the different public records requests that your organization have made to the District. The District is also working on a number of other requests from other Requestors.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are copied on an email from Dr. Shelley Redinger - Superintendent Richland School District from Dr. Redinger's \"@rsd.edu\" email address, including Nancy.Mayer@rsd.edu (Nancy Mayer - Executive Assistant to Superintendent and School Board) Nayomi.Munguia@rsd.edu (Nayomi Munguia - Records Specialist), and Tim.Praino@rsd.edu (Tim Praino - Executive Director of Human Resources) do you believe these are all the same person because each email address ends in @rsd.edu? \r\n\r\nHow about the wide world of @gmail.com? One great big \"organization?\" All the same \"person?\"\r\n\r\nYou went to law school right? Gonzaga University, J.D., 1998? Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) #28996 (attachment). I suspect you are a competent guy. This entire obtuse \"what is an email?\" exercise is a stain on your credibility.\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Are there different employees of Muckrock making different requests? Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\"\r\n\r\nI would direct you to the text at the bottom of EVERY request passed through the MUCKROCK website portal on behalf of public records requestors, it was included in my 11-15-22 request and it's real clear:\r\n\r\n\"PLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests. Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\"\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, no employee of Muckrock has ever made a single public records request of the Richland School District. I doubt they ever will.\r\n\r\nYou can however count on the growing plethora of unhappy citizens of Richland, Washington as well as the parents of kids in the Richland School District to request public records from your agency to better understand the questionable decisions and choices that have been made by Richland School District employees and School Board members concerning public money and public education in their community. \r\n\r\nI have nothing to do with the MUCKROCK organization other than to use their service to make a public records request.\r\n\r\nI am a private citizen of the State of Washington. \r\n\r\n\"RCW 42.56.030 - Construction.\r\n\r\nThe people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected.\"\r\n\r\nI hope this provides requested \"insight.\" Frankly, I find this banal back and forth to be a complete waste of time. \r\n\r\nI suggest your public agency work as directed with all due diligence and haste per the revised code of Washington to produce the identified records requested. Fail not at your peril, under penalty of law.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\n Good Afternoon: The District is in the process of mailing you the next installment of records that are responsive to your records request.\u00a0 Previously you directed the District that you do not wish to use the District\u2019s third-party public records platform (GovQA). Since that time, the District has been mailing you thumb drives containing files of responsive records. \r\nThere have been some questions about the fees the District charges related to public records request.\u00a0 The District\u2019s policy and procedure can be found that the following links: https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577 \r\nThe District Procedure 4040, states that the District charges the actual costs of mailing to requestors.\u00a0 Further it also provides: c. Cost for Electronic Records. The cost for providing electronic records is as follows: 1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records; 2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery; 3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and 4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device (flash drive) provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge. \r\nThese fees are also reflected in RCW 42.56.120(2)(a)-(c) which states, \u201c (2)(a) Agency charges for actual costs may only be imposed in accordance with the costs established and published by the agency pursuant to RCW (7), and in accordance with the statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs. In no event may an agency charge a per page cost greater than the actual cost as established and published by the agency.

To the extent the agency has not determined the actual costs of copying public records, the agency may not charge in excess of: (i) Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of agency equipment to photocopy public records; (ii) Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to scan the records; (iii) Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery; and (iv) Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to send the records electronically. The agency shall take reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner available to the agency in its normal operations; and (v) The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the agency, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge. (c) The charges in (b) of this subsection may be combined to the extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response to a particular request \r\nThe District will continue to produce responsive records. The District estimates it will be mailing you the next installment of responsive records in the next five working days. \r\nIf you have any questions or if I have misunderstood your request in any way, please let me know, \r\nGalt L.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

Therefore, we must determine where the information you have requested would be located and request a document search be conducted by the relevant records custodians.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to process your request at this time. Please be advised that your request, as submitted, is not perfected. It does not reasonably describe the records sought, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Please note that, pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.5, FOIA requests must describe the documents requested in sufficient detail to allow the FOIA Office to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Additionally, the FOIA does not require agencies to create records in response to FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached out to our National Water Safety Program Manager, who will need additional information in order to search for documents. Please note that Bobber has been the USACE National Water Safety Mascot for several years and is used agency\u2011wide, so it would be impossible to provide the number of times Bobber has been mentioned and/or featured in USACE materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specificity would be helpful. (1) Are you willing to narrow the scope of your request to include specific USACE districts or locations? (2) You provide a very broad list of categories for the types of documents and records you seek; however, what documents or records are most relevant to the information you need for your specific purpose? (3) Please provide a specific timeframe?\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this message by narrowing the scope of your request to more reasonably describe the records you seek. Any details you can provide will be helpful.\r\n\r\nYour request file will remain open for 10 business days while we await your response. If no response is received by February 2, 2022, we will assume you are no longer interested and will close your request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMary Alice Smith\r\nParalegal Specialist\r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\r\nHECSA - Office of Counsel\r\n7701 Telegraph Road\r\nAlexandria, VA  22315\r\n703-428-8160 (office)\r\n703-428-7221 (fax)\r\nMary.A.Smith@usace.army.mil\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION -ATTORNEY-CLIENT/ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT.

I am seeking records sufficient to answer the following questions: \r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to have a water safety mascot in the first place, and what was the thought process behind that?\r\n(2) Who designed the mascot, and what was the design process like (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n(3) When and how were the other characters in what I'm going to call the \"Bobber Extended Universe\" created? (e.g. Ranger Buck, Ranger Jane, Ranger Toro, Tackle, Jacques Catsto, Corkey, Sinker)\r\n(4) Were any Bobber-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g trading cards, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n(5) Were there any life-size Bobber costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n(6) Did anyone in Congress ever object to USCA's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is sufficient information to enable your search.\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis request focuses on the planning and safety of a nationwide high pressure carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline network spanning nearly every state.\r\n\r\nWe submit this records request in light of the HuffPost article \u201cThe Gassing Of Satartia\u201d by Dan Zegart, which details an accident in Mississippi where a large CO2 pipeline ruptured in February 2020, flooding a small town with a dense cloud of CO2 and injuring dozens of people, some of whom were found unconscious, trapped in their cars while trying to escape. Most residents were unaware of the danger prior to the incident or how to respond.\r\n\r\nMaps found within reports published by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Carbon Capture Program, Princeton University and non-profit organizations like the Great Plains Institute, show a vast nationwide network of planned CO2 pipelines. According to maps attached below the request (Carbon Capture Coalition, Great Plains Institute, \u201cFederal Policy Blueprint\u201d February 2021, pg.16 and Princeton University, \u201cNet Zero America\u201d, December 2020, page 243), California is identified as having existing CO2 pollution sources and/or planned CO2 pipelines and disposal sites.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request copies of all communications, reports, notes, and discussions pertaining to the safety of carbon dioxide (CO2) pipelines that have been built or will be built within California as part of a national carbon capture and storage (CCS) plan being developed by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and it\u2019s Carbon Capture Program. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request all copies of any notes, communications, and/or discussions between the California's Governor's Office and any state or federal agency regarding CO2 transport and CO2 pipelines. The agencies in question include, but are not limited to the agencies listed below:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tInteragency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage\r\n\u2022\tDepartment of Energy: Office of Fossil Energy, Carbon Storage Program\r\n\u2022\tDepartment of Interior: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \r\n\u2022\tInterstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) \r\n\u2022\tDepartment of Transportation (DOT)\r\n\u2022\tEnvironmental Protection Agency\r\n\u2022\tGround Water Protection Council (GWPC)\r\n\r\nI also request copies of any notes, communications, discussions including but not limited to the following topic areas:\r\n\r\nRouting and Risks\r\n\u2022\tAny specific CO2 pipeline routes discussed within California\r\n\u2022\tConsideration of potential risks to communities or environmental justice concerns during route planning process\r\n\u2022\tRisk of leaks from CO2 pipelines\r\n\u2022\tPipeline construction specifications - diameter, pressure, capacity of pipelines to be built\r\n\u2022\tExperiments or modeling of CO2 pipeline accidents\r\n\u2022\tWarning systems for nearby communities\r\n\u2022\tSpecialized CO2 training for first responders\r\n\u2022\tInformation and/or training for health care staff in treatment of hypercapnia (CO2 poisoning)\r\n\r\nThe time frame for this request is 2003 to the present.\r\n\r\nClimate Investigations Center (CIC) requests these records so that communities may have adequate information in order to protect themselves from the hazards posed by CO2 pipelines. The state\u2019s Public Records/Open Records/FOIA law is designed to ensure transparency and for that reason, agencies are to liberally interpret the law in favor of disclosure and to process records in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of these records, especially for proposed pipelines, cannot reasonably present a danger to public safety and instead would provide a powerful tool for community input prior to construction. Additionally, to the extent your search results contain information that is legally exempt from disclosure, non-exempt material must be separated from those records to the extent feasible and provided in response to this request.\r\n\r\nBecause CIC requests this information for the public benefit and has no commercial interest in the material, I also request a waiver of fees. Should you decide to charge fees for providing copies of records in response to my request, please notify me. If practicable, provide copies of records in their native format. I also request that you provide records in electronic form. Please reach out to me with any questions or issues regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nDaniel Zegart\r\nSenior Investigator\r\nClimate Investigations Center\r\ninfo@climateinvestigations.org\r\n\r\n&\r\n\r\nKert Davies\r\nDirector\r\nClimate Investigations Center\r\ninfo@climateinvestigations.org",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Belle,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office. The Controller serves as the chief accounting officer and auditor for the City and County of San Francisco. The Controller's Office is responsible for governance and conduct of key aspects of the City's financial operations, including operating the City's financial systems and issuing its financial procedures, maintaining the City's internal control environment, processing payroll for City employees, managing the City's bonds and debt portfolio, and processing and monitoring the City's budget. The department audits and produces regular reports on the City's financial and economic condition and the operations and performance of City government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Public Records Act requires an agency to make available to any person a copy of an, \u201cidentifiable record or records\u201d in its possession (California Government Code \u00a77922.530(a) (formerly \u00a76253(b)).) The City\u2019s obligation under the Sunshine Ordinance, like the California Public Records Act, is to produce public records in its custody (San Francisco Administration Code \u00a767.20(b).) There is no requirement that a department or officer construct a document to meet the specifications of the request. Your request is so open-ended and all-encompassing that it must be narrowed to meet this identifiability standard. The Controller's Office is available to assist you in formulating a request that meets that standard. Please feel free to contact us for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also find links below to online tools including SFOpenBook, DataSF and SFController Reports, where the Public has 24/7 access to City budget, financial, supplier and operating data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* SFOpenBook -\u00a0https://openbook.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* DataSF -\u00a0https://datasf.org\r\n\r\n* SFController -\u00a0Reports Search\r\n\r\n* CCSF\u2019s Public Records Requests -\u00a0https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com\r\n\r\n* CCSF Index to Records -\u00a0https://index.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* CCSF Board of Supervisors Legislation &amp; Related Reporting -\u00a0https://sfgov.legistar.com/Legislation.aspx\r\n\r\n* San Francisco Sales Tax Map\u00a0-\u00a0http://sfstax.hdlgov.com/geodata/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaire Stone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Controller\r\n\r\nCity and County of San Francisco\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City and County of San Francisco.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing SummerCon AKA CyberView, one of the oldest\r\n    hacker conventions, and the longest running such conference in the US.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
