Part 304. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a)(2) further supports his appointment and states that the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cmay procure services of experts and consultants in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of section 3109 of title 5.\u201d His duties currently relate to improper payments and SSA\u2019s Death Master File (records maintained by SSA on deceased individuals). SSA is currently working with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to effectuate an interagency agreement for Employee 1 to be detailed temporarily to SBA. \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 3, a Schedule C Policy Advisor, detailed from the Department of Labor to SSA. The agreement finalizing his onboarding is dated February 22, 2025. His duties currently relate to improper payments and SSA\u2019s Death Master File (containing information about decedents from SSA records). \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 5, an engineer, detailed from the United States DOGE Service to SSA. The agreement finalizing his\r\nonboarding is an Interagency Agreement with U.S. Digital Service (now U.S. DOGE Service) covering Fiscal Year 2025, which was amended February 20, 2025 to recognize the change to U.S. DOGE Service; extend the duration to July 4, 2026; and modify and supplement certain terms in the original agreement. The agreement authorizes work to include, but does not limit work to, increasing efficiency and the modernization of SSA IT infrastructure and systems, detecting waste, fraud, and abuse. \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 2, Senior Advisor (Program Specialist AD-0301-00). He is in the process of being detailed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to SSA. The agency is waiting on final signature on the interagency detail agreement from NASA. His duties currently include serving as the DOGE lead at SSA\r\n\r\n\"On February 19, 2025, Employee 10, a software engineer, was detailed from the Office of the Administrator at the General Services Administration to SSA. His duties currently include supporting the leadership team with the assessment and enhancement of internal processes and operational procedures, specifically, focusing on identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement and ensuring that the administrative and programmatic functions align with the best practices for effectiveness and accountability. \r\n\r\n\"On February 26, 2025, Employee 8, an engineer, was detailed from Office of Personnel Management to SSA. His duties currently relate to improper payments and death data.\r\n\r\n\"On February 27, 2025, Employees 4, 6, and 9 were each appointed as an expert, special government employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 and 5 C.F.R. Part 304. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7904(a)(2) further supports their appointment and states that the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cmay procure services of experts and consultants in accordance with the provisions of section 3109 of title 5.\u201d All three of these individuals\u2019 duties currently relate to improper payments and death data.\r\n\r\n\"On March 5, 2025, the agency began onboarding Employee 7, as a detailee from Department of Labor (DOL) to SSA. The agency is waiting on final signatures on the interagency detail agreement from DOL. His duties currently relate to improper payments. \r\n\r\nI would like to request the following information:\r\n1. For the SGEs, I would like to receive whatever publicly shareable details can be made of their appointments, including if they signed SF-61s\r\n2. For the detailees, I would like to see their detailing agreements made with the other agency governing the scope of work and who they report to, etc.\r\n3. For the SGE potentially being detailed to the Small Business Administration, I would like to see that agreement\r\n4. I would like to request \"Signed Acknowledgements of SSA Information Security and Privacy Awareness Training, which covers requirements for compliance with information security and privacy policies of SSA.\" for both the SGEs and detailees.\r\n\r\nI expect the timespan for this inquiry to be in February 2025, but it does seem like there might be a pre-existing USDS detailing arrangemnt for Employee 5. I would prefer for documentation to include identities, since these individuals are government employees carrying out public services in an non-classified environment, but if those need to be redacted, I would still prefer to see the documentation of these detailing arrangements and SGE appointments where applicable. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",

LEGAL BASIS AND PRECEDENT\r\nThis request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552 and is supported by the following legal authorities and judicial precedents, which mandate exhaustive and complete searches for all relevant documents:\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989)\r\nMilner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011)\r\nOpenTheGovernment v. Department of Justice, 18-cv-1038 (D.D.C. May 17, 2018)\r\nPublic Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989)\r\nTruitt v. Department of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990)\r\nIn addition, binding regulations under 28 C.F.R. Part 16 require that searches be \u201creasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\u201d\r\n\r\nV. EXPEDITED PROCESSING REQUEST\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II) and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f16.5(e) on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nUrgency in Informing the Public: The requested records are central to investigations into potential infringements on constitutional rights and may reveal significant government overreach.\r\nHistorical and Ongoing Significance: The records span multiple administrations and are essential for determining whether current policies continue or depart from prior practices.\r\nMedia and Legal Implications: Timely disclosure is critical to ensure informed public debate and to enable judicial review if the records are improperly withheld.\r\n\r\nVI. FEE WAIVER REQUEST\r\n\r\nI request a full waiver of all fees associated with the processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f16.10(k) because:\r\n\r\nThe disclosure of these records is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to public understanding of governmental operations and potential constitutional violations.\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\nPrecedents, including Cause of Action v. Federal Trade Commission, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and Carney v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814 (2d Cir. 1994), support fee waivers for requests that enhance governmental transparency.\r\nIf fees are expected to exceed $100, please contact me prior to proceeding further.\r\n\r\nVII.

PRESERVATION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nI require that all potentially responsive records be immediately preserved. This includes ensuring that all electronic files retain their original metadata and that no automated deletion or archival processes alter or destroy the relevant records.\r\n\r\nIX. VAUGHN INDEX REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the responsive records is withheld or redacted, I request a complete Vaughn index that:\r\n\r\nLists each document withheld or redacted with specificity.\r\nIdentifies the exact statutory exemption(s) claimed.\r\nProvides a detailed explanation of how each exemption justifies the withholding, including an analysis of the potential harm from disclosure.\r\nDiscloses any segregable portions that can be released.\r\n\r\nX. ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING AND SEARCH DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nIn compliance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(6)(A)(i) and relevant case law, please include with your response:\r\n\r\nThe tracking number assigned to this request.\r\nThe name(s) of the FOIA personnel responsible for processing this request.\r\nA detailed description of the search methodology employed, including all systems, databases, repositories, and local storage locations searched.\r\nThe exact search terms used (including Boolean operators and any modifications).\r\nDate ranges for each search.\r\nDocumentation of personnel involved and the time spent on each search.\r\nCopies or summaries of search logs, including timestamps and result counts.\r\nCertification by the designated Information Management Officer that all potentially responsive records were searched.\r\n\r\nXI. RIGHT TO APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve my right to appeal any adverse determination regarding this request, including:\r\n\r\nDenials of expedited processing or fee waivers.\r\nInsufficient or inadequate searches.\r\nWithholdings or redactions based on FOIA exemptions.\r\nAny such determination shall be subject to immediate judicial review as provided under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(4)(E) and other applicable law.\r\n\r\nXII. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE OF INTERACTION\r\n\r\nThere is extensive, independently documented evidence of interactions between U.S. Border Patrol personnel and militia groups.

As of March 6, 0225 the following links were active to documents (at least one in .PDF format) containing multiple pages of admissions, applications and enrollment data that VMI removed from the site so they are no longer accessible: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/oie/VMI-Enrollment-Details.pdf\r\n\r\nIn addition to this specific document, all files in this root directory as of March 6, 2025 should be available:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/oie/\r\n\r\nThis page also had links to registration data that is not longer available:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.vmi.edu/academics/support/registrar/registration-and-enrollment/\r\n\r\nGoven these documents exist and were publically available as of March 6, 2025 there is not reason they cannot be provided expeditiously so no extension to the 5 day limit is justifiable. In addition, since these documents existed in those two directories and especially in https://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/oie/ a charge to search for documents does not appear to be justified.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

A copy of any version of the \u201cBias Incident Reporting\u201d form (the \u201cForm\u201d) used by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights since January 1, 2020.\r\n\r\n2. Policies, guides, manuals, memoranda, or training materials provided to any staff member or volunteer tasked with receiving, handling, or responding to any report submitted through the Form since January 1, 2020. \r\n\r\n3. Any statistics, annual reports (or other periodic reports), or synopses of complaints, incidents, or responses concerning \u201cbias incidents\u201d (or the processing thereof) submitted through the Form since January 1, 2020.\r\n\r\n4. Any report submitted through the Form since January 1, 2020. \r\n\r\n5. If the Form\u2019s reporting system is associated with a database, any copies of database entries related to the Form reporting and any records maintained in accordance with the operation of the database since January 1, 2020. \r\n\r\n\u201cDocument\u201d means any record consisting of handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing, any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored. \r\n\r\nThe names, phone numbers, and mailing address of persons other than government employees or officials should be redacted from any responsive documents. \r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying the responsive records. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to defending, preserving, and extending civil liberties. The records sought herein are not sought for a commercial purpose. As discussed in greater detail below, release of the information requested will further the public\u2019s understanding of the City of Eden Prairie\u2019s efforts to address the concerns of its citizens with respect to social issues, as well as the Minnesota Department of Human Rights' policies and practices regarding offensive speech and its citizens\u2019 First Amendment rights. The purposes of the Minnesota Data Practices Act will be furthered by a waiver of costs because the documents requested will contribute substantially to the public\u2019s understanding of how government officials implement policies relating to offensive speech, and whether those efforts and policies are consistent with the First Amendment.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any portion, or all, of this request, please provide me with a written explanation of the reason(s) for your denial, including a citation to each specific statutory exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. If you conclude that portions of the records that I request are exempt from disclosure, please release the remainder of such records for inspection and copying, redacting only the portion or portions that you claim are exempt. For any exemptions, please note whether it is discretionary and, if so, the basis for refusing to exercise discretion in favor of granting access.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
