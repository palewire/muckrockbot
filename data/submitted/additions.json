Specifically, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nA log/database of all ALPR reads, including whether the read resulted in a hit/alarm, whether the hit/alarm was accepted, which hotlist(s) the hit/alarm corresponded to, whether the hit/alarm resulted in a vehicle stop, and whether the stop resulted in a citation, arrest or other action.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\nMatter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Police Department, 139 Misc. 2d 893 (Sup. Ct. 1988): This case established that records created by ALPRs are subject to disclosure under the New York Freedom of Information Law.\r\nMatter of Fappiano v. New York City Police Department, 95 A.D.3d 923 (2d Dept. 2012): This case involved a request for records relating to the NYPD's use of ALPRs. The court held that the NYPD must disclose records related to its use of ALPRs under FOIL, including records related to the purchase, maintenance, and operation of the ALPRs.\r\nMatter of New York Civil Liberties Union v. City of New York Police Department, 18 N.Y.3d 147 (2011): This case involved a request for records related to the NYPD's use of ALPRs. The court held that records related to the NYPD's use of ALPRs are subject to disclosure under FOIL, including records related to the purchase, maintenance, and operation of the ALPRs.\r\nPlease note that if any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I reserve the right to seek legal remedies, including a court order compelling the production of the records. The New York State Courts have consistently held that the public has a right to access government records, including those created and maintained by law enforcement agencies, subject to limited exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
