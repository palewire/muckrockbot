If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply. \r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND. \r\n\r\nRecords sought are to expose potential corruption with seemingly malignant intent by DOJ\u2019s Office of Information Policy (DOJ OIP), the Department of Defense, and the Office of Government Information Services not only in processing my prior 2018 FOIA request seeking \u201cAll records of communications within DOJ and between the Department of Defense (DOD) and DOJ from 1 October 2016 to present regarding DOD\u2019s FY 2017 Annual FOIA report submission,\u201d but in other matters.\r\n\r\nDOJ OIP knows that I initiated FOIA request of DOJ-2019-000086 because DOD submitted a knowingly materially inaccurate FY 2017 annual FOIA report and DOJ OIP knew this in advance before approving DOD\u2019s FY 2017 annual FOIA report based on my FOIA compliance inquiries and OGIS mediation documenting same. Yet DOJ OIP approved DOD\u2019s annual FOIA report and cooked the books\u201d in DOJ OIP\u2019s 2017 Litigation and Compliance Report,\u201d according to my records. Defense Health Agency then did not include any individualized tracking numbers in its FOIA raw data as required making traceability impossible. DOJ OIP has refused to act. Department of Navy and other DOD entities have also acted improperly and continue to do so. For example, I have countless open FOIA requests and appeals dating back to 2013 that have never been reported.\r\n\r\nThere was an OIG complaint involving DOJ OIP\u2019s handling of DOD\u2019s FY 2017 FOIA reporting.\r\n\r\nI literally located all those same emails in my files within 5 minutes, begging the question of why it took DOJ OIP five years to respond to my FOIA request and why now. Since it is impermissible/unlawful for DOJ OIP to redact or withhold anything in emails originating from me \u2013 a private requester in the public domain \u2013 pursuant to my own FOIA request, the review and redaction could easily have been completed within twenty working days. \r\n\r\nDOJ OIP expended resources impermissibly redacting content and masking content by overlaying black boxes labeled \u201cDuplicative\u201d to my emails in the second section of released records beginning at page 783, which DOJ OIP reports are records that \u201cwere not provided by you.\u201d  Even when that is not the case. \r\n\r\nDOJ OIP divided its released responsive records into two categories: 779 Pages Provided by Requester\u201d and \u201c75 Pages for Release, which DOJ OIP states: \u201cwere not provided by you.\u201d The latter statement is materially false. \r\n\r\nMy initial review of those 75 pages shows that they consist of DOJ OIP or OGIS forwarding my emails with attachments or responding to them. In 56 instances,  DOJ OIP unlawfully blacked out everything below the \u201csent\u201d line in my emails being forwarded or responded to, thereby obscuring who I sent them to, and the content sent to such persons. This took some effort. It is unlawful. And the improper blackened emails are not even all duplicates of other content released.\r\n\r\nPlease see the example of where DOJ OIP unlawfully redacted content with black box labeled \u201cDuplicate\u201d for pages 783 to 787 of DOJ OIP\u2019s \u201c75 Pages for Release\u201d (see \u201cPurported duplicate #1. Pages 783 -787\u201d See Enclosure 3.). I am attaching the original redacted email \u201cHammond original email to Pustay of 2018 10 26 w. attachment (pp 783 - 787).\u201d See Enclosure 4. The blacked-out content at pages 783 \u2013 787 are not duplicated within the released records.

This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n\r\n4.\tPreemptively Searches. The searches to locate records are extremely simple and can be performed well withing my two hours of free search time as an \u201call other requester.\u201d Similarly, since I am requesting electronic records, there should not be any fees for copying.\r\n\r\n5.\tPreemptively B6.

There cannot be any redactions or withholdings under Exemption B5 because there are no policy or legal issues related to such communications.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files or other mutually agreed by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n\r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest. See below AGREEMENT TO PAY FEES and EXPEDITED PROCESSING for justification. \r\n\r\nPreemptively. The searches to locate records are extremely simple and can be performed well withing my two hours of free search time as an \u201call other requester.\u201d Records are located in the FOIA case file, FOIAonline and simple email searches. Similarly, since I am requesting electronic records, there should not be any fees for copying.\r\n\r\nBy way of further amplification to above.\r\n\r\nFactor 1. The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\" The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote.\r\n\u2022\tRecords sought concern the integrity of DOJ OIP\u2019s FOIA processing. See EXPEDITED PROCESSING below. \r\n\r\nFactor 2. The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be \"likely to contribute\" to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding when nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRecords sought concern the integrity of DOJ OIP\u2019s FOIA Processing.\r\n\r\nFactor 3. The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public is likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to \"public understanding.\" The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRecords sought concern the integrity of DOJ OIP\u2019s FOIA Processing.\r\n\r\nFactor 4. The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute \"significantly\" to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced significantly by the disclosure. The FOI Office will not make value judgments about whether information that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government is \"important\" enough to be made public.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRecords sought concern the integrity of FOIAonline and EPA\u2019s management of same. See above. See EXPEDITED PROCESSING below. The disappearance of 71 of my Navy FOIA requests from FOIAonline is of great public interest and interest to the entire FOIA community, particularly as FOIAonline is decommissioning with the potential loss of records.\r\n\r\nFactor 5. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. The FOI Office will consider any commercial interest of the requester or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters will be given an opportunity in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThere is no commercial interest nor is the information of commercial value.\r\n\r\nFactor 6. The primary interest in disclosure: Whether any identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure that disclosure is \"primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. FOI Offices ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRecords sought concern the integrity of DOJ OIP\u2019s FOIA processing.\r\n\u2022\tof DOJ-2019-000086\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAdditionally, I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting. I have an active email distribution list of over 1,200 Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties via various email accounts including but not limited to foiacomplaince@gmail.com, dod.foia.pa@gmail.com  and others.  I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council  \r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments \r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments  https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting  \r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nSee also AGREEMENT TO PAY FEES for justification. I am seeking expedited processing due to:\r\n1.\t\u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if the information is requested by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public.\u201d\r\na.\tThe information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence related to the integrity of DOJ OIP\u2019s FOIA processing.\r\nb.\tThe  subject is of widespread and exceptional interest.\r\nc.\tI am a person \u201cprimarily engaged in disseminating information.\r\nd.\tThe request is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity.\r\ne.\tRecords sought are to expose potential corruption with seemingly malignant intent by DOJ\u2019s Office of Information Policy (DOJ OIP), the Department of Defense, and the Office of Government Information Services not only in processing my prior 2018 FOIA request seeking \u201cAll records of communications within DOJ and between the Department of Defense (DOD) and DOJ from 1 October 2016 to present regarding DOD\u2019s FY 2017 Annual FOIA report submission,\u201d but in other matters.\r\n\r\nDOJ OIP knows that I initiated FOIA request DOJ-2019-000086 because DOD submitted a knowingly materially inaccurate FY 2017 annual FOIA report and DOJ OIP knew this in advance before approving DOD\u2019s FY 2017 annual FOIA report based on my FOIA compliance inquiries and OGIS mediation documenting same. Yet DOJ OIP approved DOD\u2019s annual FOIA report and cooked the books\u201d in DOJ OIP\u2019s 2017 Litigation and Compliance Report,\u201d according to my records. Defense Health Agency then did not include any individualized tracking numbers in its FOIA raw data as required making traceability impossible. DOJ OIP has refused to act. Department of Navy and other DOD entities have also acted improperly and continue to do so. For example, I have countless open FOIA requests and appeals dating back to 2013 that have never been reported.\r\n\r\nThere was an OIG complaint involving DOJ OIP\u2019s handling of DOD\u2019s FY 2017 FOIA reporting.\r\n\r\nI literally located all those same emails in my files within 5 minutes, begging the question of why it took DOJ OIP five years to respond to my FOIA request and why now. Since it is impermissible/unlawful for DOJ OIP to redact or withhold anything in emails originating from me \u2013 a private requester in the public domain \u2013 pursuant to my own FOIA request, the review and redaction could easily have been completed within twenty working days. \r\n\r\nDOJ OIP expended resources impermissibly redacting content and masking content by overlaying black boxes labeled \u201cDuplicative\u201d to my emails in the second section of released records beginning at page 783, which DOJ OIP reports are records that \u201cwere not provided by you.\u201d  Even when that is not the case. \r\n\r\nDOJ OIP divided its released responsive records into two categories: 779 Pages Provided by Requester\u201d and \u201c75 Pages for Release, which DOJ OIP states: \u201cwere not provided by you.\u201d The latter statement is materially false. \r\n\r\nMy initial review of those 75 pages shows that they consist of DOJ OIP or OGIS forwarding my emails with attachments or responding to them. In 56 instances,  DOJ OIP unlawfully blacked out everything below the \u201csent\u201d line in my emails being forwarded or responded to, thereby obscuring who I sent them to, and the content sent to such persons. This took some effort. It is unlawful. And the improper blackened emails are not even all duplicates of other content released.\r\n\r\nPlease see the example of where DOJ OIP unlawfully redacted content with black box labeled \u201cDuplicate\u201d for pages 783 to 787 of DOJ OIP\u2019s \u201c75 Pages for Release\u201d (see \u201cPurported duplicate #1. Pages 783 -787\u201d attached). I am attaching the original redacted email \u201cHammond original email to Pustay of 2018 10 26 w. attachment (pp 783 - 787)\u201d The blacked-out content at pages 783 \u2013 787 are not duplicated within the released records.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default. \r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. \r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later. \r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. \r\n\r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues. \r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action  I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data.  Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System). \r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nALTERATION/DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1519 - Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records.

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P043727-091723.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.
