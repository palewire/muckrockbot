        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll records held by the New York City Police Department at 1 Police Plaza related to the missing person case of Leanne Marie Hausberg (Case Number: 09-7493 CF, missing March 18, 1999, from Brooklyn, NY; DOB: August 9, 1984). Specifically, I seek:\r\n\r\n1) All non-exempt investigative records, including but not limited to incident reports, follow-up reports, witness statements, and case summaries, held at 1 Police Plaza.\r\n2) A copy Leanne Hausberg's diary, which is located at One Police Plaza, as confirmed to me by former NYPD detective John Ferriso.\r\n3) General NYPD policies, procedures, or training manuals for handling missing persons cases in 1999, particularly for minors and Indigenous persons, to understand investigative protocols.\r\n4)Any inter-agency communications (e.g., with the FBI or Kings County DA) related to Case #09-7493 CF, redacted as needed to protect privacy.\r\n\r\nI understand that certain records may be exempt under POL \u00a7 87(2), such as those interfering with an ongoing investigation (POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(i)), personal privacy (POL \u00a7 87(2)(b)), or medical/DNA information (POL \u00a7 87(2)(a)). However, given that this case is over 26 years old with no publicly reported developments since 1999, it likely has no active leads, and thus disclosure would not interfere with an ongoing investigation, as exemptions cease when investigations conclude (Lesher v. Hynes, 19 NY3d 57, 2012). I request that any exempt portions be redacted and that all segregable, non-exempt records be released, as required by Gould v. NYC Police Dep\u2019t (89 N.Y.2d 267). \r\n\r\nIf no additional records exist beyond the initial complaint report provided to me on July 9, 2025, please confirm this in writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is made in the public interest to understand NYPD\u2019s handling of missing minors\u2019 cases, as highlighted by media coverage (e.g., ABC7\u2019s \u201cMissing\u201d series) and also to understand the NYPD's handling of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous People crisis, as Leanne Hausberg (Birth Name: Leanne Marie Billie) was half-Native American.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at sarahaziz822@gmail.com or (929) 752-2814 for correspondence. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Aziz",
