        "communication": "ORS Reference number 2400603.\r\n\r\nOpen Investigation with the FBI\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon careful consideration and application of the required Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test, it is my determination that public policies favoring nondisclosure outweigh any public interest in disclosure.  The records that you have requested pertain to an investigation that is currently on-going.  In Linzmeyer v. Forcey, 2002 WI 84, \u00b6 30, 254 Wis. 2d 306, the Wisconsin Supreme Court opined that when an investigation is on-going the \u201cgeneral presumption of openness will likely be overcome.\u201d  Law enforcement records pertaining to ongoing investigations can be particularly sensitive.  In this instance, release of the requested records related to the on-going investigation, prior to its completion, could compromise or prejudice additional investigation, could impact the ability of law enforcement to gain cooperation from potential witnesses, and could infringe on the reputation and privacy of victims and witnesses.  The records also contain raw investigation data gathered from witnesses of varying degrees of reliability that has not yet been properly verified.  See Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 30-39; see alsoJournal/Sentinel, Inc. v. Aagerup, 145 Wis. 2d 818 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic policies in favor of keeping strategies for crime detection and prevention were also considered.  See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d).  The exceptions to the requirement of a government body to meet in open session under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85 are indicative of public policy and may be used as grounds for denying a public records request after application of the balancing test.  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a).  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d) has been interpreted by courts as being representative as a public policy favoring nondisclosure of records related to ongoing criminal investigations.  See e.g. Aagerup, 145 Wis.2d at 825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso considered was whether disclosure of the records that relate to the ongoing investigation would reveal prosecutorial techniques or strategies.  \u201cPublic records containing prosecution strategies and police tactics are not specifically excepted from disclosure by Wisconsin statutes, but records custodians can properly consider such content when determining \u2018whether the presumption of openness \u2026 is overcome by another public policy.\u2019\u201d  Democratic Party of Wisconsin v. Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of Justice, 2016 WI 100, \u00b6 18, 372 Wis.2d 460.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, although the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 5 USC \u00a7 552 does not apply to Wisconsin, Wisconsin Courts have held that FOIA exceptions may be considered when applying the balancing test.  See Linzmeyer, 2002 WI 84; Kraemer Bros. v. Dane County, 229 Wis. 2d 86, 103 (Ct. App. 1999), review denied, 231 Wis. 2d 375 (1999).  The relevant FOIA exception includes section 7(E) (records which disclose techniques, procedures or guidelines for law enforcement investigations) 5 USC \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(7)(E).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, pursuant to the reasons set forth above, your request for records that pertain to the ongoing investigation that you have referenced is being denied.  If you wish, you may resubmit your request once the investigation has concluded.  If you choose to do so, your request will be re-evaluated at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis determination is subject to review by mandamus action under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1), or upon an application to the Wisconsin Attorney General or the Milwaukee County Corporation Counsel.\r\n\nSergeant Jason Kotarak\r\nOpen Records Section\r\nMilwaukee Police Department",
