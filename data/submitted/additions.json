The U.S. Supreme Court stated in NLRB v. Robbins Tire Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), that the core purpose of the FOIA is to contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Furthermore, in Carlson v. Pima County, 141 Ariz. 487 (1984), the Arizona Supreme Court reiterated the significance of the state's public records law for public accountability.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
