        "communication": "Dear Jason,\r\n\r\nI work in the Press Office at the Department of Buildings, and I was forwarded your FOIL request by a member of the Department who manages FOIL requests.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of expediency, wanted to share some information on the Department's recent enforcement actions at the St. Vitus Bar. See below:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   On 2/16/24, DOB conducted an inspection of 1120 Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn, in response to over a dozen 311 complaints from members of the public about the location.\r\n  *   Upon our arrival to the scene, we found approximately 250 people on the first floor of the building, assembled in an illegal eating and drink establishment.\r\n  *   The Certificate of Occupancy for the building indicates that the first floor of this building is supposed be used for a commercial store and for the storage of machinery.\r\n  *   As a result of our inspection we issued a violation to the property owner for operating the unpermitted place of assembly, contrary to the legal occupancy of the building.\r\n  *   During our inspection, DOB did not issue a Vacate Order at the building. The building can still be occupied.\r\n  *   This is the second time we have issued a violation to 1120 Manhattan Avenue for this issue. We previously issued a similar violation to the property owner on 7/21/23.\r\n  *   That July 2023 violation remains unresolved, as the property owners never corrected the issue. That is why they were issued another violation by DOB on February 16th.\r\n  *   If the property owner wishes to legally operate the club, they can obtain permits to legally convert the space and obtain a new Certificate of Occupancy from DOB.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the above and for other information you may be seeking on this matter, you can use the Department's Building Information System (BIS) which is publicly available.\r\n\r\nIf you visit BIS and type the address of St Vitus Bar (1120 Manhattan Ave, Brooklyn) you will be directed to this page: https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=3&houseno=1120&street=Manhattan+Ave&go2=+GO+&requestid=0\r\n\r\nFrom there, you can view all 311 complaints: https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ComplaintsByAddressServlet?requestid=1&allbin=3063704\r\n\r\nAs well as DOB violations: https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ActionsByLocationServlet?requestid=1&allbin=3063704&allinquirytype=BXS4OCV3&stypeocv3=V\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the information provided here is sufficient to fulfill your FOIL request. If it is, we will close out the request. If you would like to leave it open and move forward with the FOIL request, please let us know in your response.\r\nBest,\r\nDavid Maggiotto\r\nDeputy Press Secretary\r\nNYC Department of Buildings\r\n(929) 512-0051",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",

Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2019-1161 (267171).  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, I am providing you with the requested information.  Your request is granted in full.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

Your request was received in this office on 6/12/2024. Specifically, you requested 1. The IHSC Mortality Review for Frankline Okpu, who died at GEO's Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center on December 6, 2023; or 2. the IHSC Preliminary Mortality Review. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2024-ICFO-41364.

        "communication": "Andrew Free \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR165009 \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2024-ICFO-41364 \r\n \r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 6/12/2024.  You have requested 1. The IHSC Mortality Review for Frankline Okpu, who died at GEO's Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center on December 6, 2023; or 2. the IHSC Preliminary Mortality Review. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 9 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 9 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009 \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09 Pages",

With that said, a large amount of emails sent from Jamez Holzer to our DHS FOIA staff pertain his guidance, input, comments, etc, regarding the admin work of such cases (ex: \"this covid case requires white house consult\"). I believe this is not what you're looking for. I construed that what you're looking for are general guidance to the FOIA staff regarding COVID-19 and instructions for the FOIA Office to adjust to it?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is correct.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions and would like to further discuss your request, please don't hesitate in letting me know.\r\n\r\nMy phone number is 703-362-7078.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJennifer A.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\nSincerely, \r\nMakayla Connor\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nConnor.mak@northeastern.edu\r\n(508) 340-1740\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMakayla Connor",

Your reply objects to the City's denial of access pursuant to OPRA's security exemption and based upon protecting the citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy who attended the Teaneck demonstration held on March 10, 2024.  The City evaluated its prior response in light of your reply, and its position remains that you are not legally entitled to access the requested materials.  In addition to the reasons set forth in the City's March 14, 2024 response, an additional reason that the requested materials are exempt from public access is that the underlying footage constitutes law enforcement records relating to citizens who were neither arrested nor charged.  See Fuster v. Twp. of Chatham, 477 N.J. Super. 477 (App. Div. 2023) (determining that government records involving a person who has not been arrested or charged with an offense are entitled to confidentiality based upon long-established judicial precedent).  As such, the City is legally precluded from releasing any footage of citizens generated during the March 10th demonstration.  We trust that this correspondence satisfies your concerns, and we again note that the City is closing out your OPRA request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor O'Brien (she/her)\r\nCity Clerk's Office - OPRA Clerk\r\n65 Central Avenue, 3rd Floor\r\nHackensack, NJ 07601\r\n(P): 201-646-3940\r\n(F): 201-457-1466\r\ntobrien@hackensack.org<mailto:tobrien@hackensack.org>",

Your reply requests that the City reconsider its prior denial of access based upon \"your strong common law right to access the video in order to monitor the police department's use of surveillance techniques on First Amendment activities and to better understand what occurred during the protest.\"  You further asserted that the blurring of faces would suffice to protect any privacy interests.\r\n\r\nIn light of your asserted interest in accessing the responsive footage and the fact that the attendees' identities cannot be ascertained from review of the footage, the City has decided to release said footage to you pursuant to the common law right of access.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",
