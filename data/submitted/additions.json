If this invoice does not reflect the licensing level of the accounts being paid for, I also request a record of licenses the City is subscribed to. I have reason to believe these records exist because the City of Seneca receives email traffic at springfieldmo-gov.mail.protection.outlook.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael",
