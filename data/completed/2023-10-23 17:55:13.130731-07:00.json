Remaining staff are diligently trying to keep pace with ongoing requests. Thank you for your understanding as we work through this change in our system. The District anticipates an installment of records will be sent to you no later than October 4, 2023.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTammy Bengen, Executive Assistant for\r\nAssistant Superintendent Equity, Engagement & Academics and\r\nAssistant Superintendent Business, Human Resources & Technology\r\n9401 Sharon Dr. | Everett, WA 98204\r\nbengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu<mailto:bengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu>",

Besides the email I am using to respond to your request, I have shared the folder with the email address sitesra47@gmail.com<mailto:sitesra47@gmail.com>.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Stanley Aronowitz.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Anonymous also hacked the BART website, releasing the personal information of 102 BART police officers, as well as account information for about 2,000 customers.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request.

        "communication": "Dear Tinker AFB:\r\n\r\nThank you so much for these records! I think that the mascot looks really good. However, I think that there may be additional records responsive to my request. I'll mention them here and hopefully spare you an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nCategory 1 of my request asked for all records related to the conception, creation, and design of Tink. You produced one sketch of the Tink mascot, but I think that there may be other sketches or design proposals that weren't produced. Here's the reason I think this: On page 1 of the records you released, someone from the costume company mentions a \"revised sketch for Tink,\" implying that there was a prior sketch. Indeed, the attachment to the email is called  \"Mascot concept_3rd round to client 051722.jpg,\" implying that there were at least two prior \"rounds\" of concept sketches. Then on page 5, someone from Tinker AFB writes to the costume company mentioning color swatches for Tink's clothing: \"The swatch 'coveralls option A' is a good match. ... From the swatches you provided the 'shoe accents option c' was the closest to coyote brown, but it was noticeably brighter. Also, was there a reason why yellow was chosen as Tink's skin tone?\" The costume company says that they'll send additional swatches. But the sketch you produced was in gray-scale, and there were no options for color swatches provided either. So there is likely at least two prior sketches, possibly another sketch with a yellow skin tone, and some proposed options for the colors of Tink's clothing. Could you please search for and produce those records?\r\n\r\nCategory 3 of my request asked for all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Tink costume. There are some communications related to the costume, but you produced no photographs of the costume or any guidelines for its use. And on page 10, someone writes: \"I'm drafting our communication strategy for the Tinker mascot.\" But that document wasn't produced either. (There is some language quoted from AFI 35-101 about community engagement in general, but it doesn't appear to be Tink specific.) Could you please search for and produce those records?\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning Operation Frostbyte, see attached for a previous official\r\n    acknowledgment.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I would especially like to see their certifications.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nGeorge Johnston\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that you received the Department\u2019s response via email on June 2, 2023. Note that training certificate dates are located on the responsive records provided to you. You have been provided with all records that the Department of State has on file, but note that the local building department may possess more records. After receiving your final response with responsive records attached, on June 3, 2023 you replied:\r\n\r\nHello, are these all the certificates on file?\r\n\r\nAlso, can you please provide a date when both individuals had active certificates?\r\nThere is no date on these certificates.\r\n\r\nPlease note that, there is nothing in the Freedom of Information Law or the Open Meetings Law that requires that government officers or employees respond to questions, supply information in response to questions or offer explanations for their governmental activities. The Freedom of Information Law pertains to existing records and specifies that government agencies need not create new records to comply with that law. If you wish to request a new record after a FOIL request has been complete, I suggest you submit a new FOIL request to: FOIL Records Access Center | NYS Department of State (govqa.us)<https://dosny.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(0ezrrrqllnoljkdbx24jdxg4))/supporthome.aspx>\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nVincent Meccariello\r\nAssistant Records Access Officer",

A copy of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) bearing tracking number SED MOU: 018-015 between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the City University of New York - Asian American/Asian Research Institute (AAARI/CUNY). This MOU was signed by Joyce Moy, Executive Director of AAARI at CUNY, on August 2, 2018, and was countersigned by Elizabeth R. Berlin, Executive Deputy Commissioner of NYSED, on July 30, 2018.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of the amended MOU (Amendment #1) to the aforementioned MOU. This amended MOU was signed by Joyce Moy on February 13, 2020, and by Phyllis D. Morris, CFO of NYSED, on January 31, 2020.\r\n\r\n3. All communications, including but not limited to emails, letters, and memos, between the named signature parties (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris) related to the MOU and its amendment. Please note that email metadata, such as sender, recipient, date, and subject line, is considered responsive factual data and should be included in the disclosure, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\n4. All cash receipts, invoices, and payments received or disbursed related to the funds specified in the MOU and its amendment, as well as any related to the work product or completion of the MOU but borne by CUNY.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with third parties, subcontractors, or external entities to AAARI/CUNY related to the MOU and its amendment. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of any and all work product and interim work product viewed by outside parties, including NYSED, subcontractors, advisors, consultants, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the advisory opinions FOIL-AO-19160, FOIL-AO-18321, and FOIL-AO-17725, even if the content of certain communications is exempt from disclosure under POL \u00a787(2)(g), the factual information about the communication itself, such as the sender, recipient, date, and subject line, should still be disclosed. This metadata does not typically contain deliberative or advisory content, but rather factual information about the communication itself. Therefore, I request that this factual information be disclosed in response to my FOIL request, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\nI would like to highlight the urgency of this request in light of the ongoing legislative discussions around Senate Bill S1402, which seeks to amend education law in relation to culturally responsive education and curriculum. The records requested are directly relevant to the public understanding of the state's efforts in this area, particularly the work of NYSED and AAARI/CUNY under the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to remind you of the retention requirements under the New York State Archives' LGS-1 schedule. Records that are subject to a FOIL request must be retained until the request has been fully resolved, including any potential appeal process.\r\n\r\nIf any record has been denied in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the law. I expect the request to be filled within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGiven the relevance of these records to ongoing legislative discussions and public interest, I kindly request that you expedite the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance with this matter.\r\n\r\nNB: You can find reference to the MOU and Amendment Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_VK1ACtp.pdf and Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_Amended_4VCegX6.pdf respectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

I am writing in response to your letter dated June 14, 2023, acknowledging the receipt of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request, and the subsequent extension letter dated July 13, 2023.\r\n\r\nI understand that the City University of New York (CUNY) University Central Office is currently conducting a diligent search for the requested records. I appreciate your efforts in this regard and acknowledge the complexity of the task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential for delays in the process. To mitigate this, I kindly request a rolling release of documents as they are found and reviewed. This would allow me to begin reviewing the information that is readily available while you continue your search for the remaining records.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request for more specific parameters for items #3 and #5, I propose the following:\r\n\r\nFor item #3, let's limit the time period to August 1, 2018, through February 29, 2021, which covers the signing of the original MOU and its amendment. The search terms could include the names of the signatories (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris), \"MOU\", \"Amendment\", \"SED MOU: 018-015\", and \"NYSED\".\r\n\r\nFor item #5, the same time period and search terms could apply. As for specific individuals from AAARI/CUNY, I would suggest starting with Joyce Moy, as she signed both the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you acknowledge receipt of this response promptly and provide an updated timeline for when I can expect to receive the first batch of documents. I understand that these processes can take time, and I appreciate your commitment to ensuring a thorough review of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",

        "communication": "I am writing to appeal the response to my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request (DEPT MR 147108) received from the Records Access Officer at the City University of New York (CUNY) University Central Office.\r\n\r\nIn the response dated June 14, 2023, the Records Access Officer requested additional information to search for \"communications\" that are responsive to request #3 and request #5 of my FOIL request. The officer asked for a specific time period, search terms, and specific individuals from \"AAARI/CUNY\" by COB June 28, 2023, or else CUNY University Central Office would deny requests #3 and #5 as overly broad.\r\n\r\nI believe this response constitutes an arbitrary denial of access and a willful attempt to avoid responding to my request. The deadline of June 28, 2023, appears to be an attempt to limit the scope of my request without conducting a detailed search, which is contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nMy original request, I believe, was reasonably described and in compliance with the FOIL. Furthermore, I have recently responded to the Records Access Officer's request for more specific parameters in a manner that is accommodating and within the bounds of reasonableness.\r\n\r\nI am appealing this decision on the grounds that it is a violation of the Freedom of Information Law, specifically Public Officers Law, Article 6, which guarantees the public's right to access government records.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that this appeal be reviewed promptly, and that the decision to impose an arbitrary deadline be reconsidered. I am also forwarding a copy of this appeal to the Committee on Open Government for their review.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

The specific reasons for the delay should be clearly articulated, and continuous updates should be provided.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that the agency adhere to the statutory timelines and provide a prompt and comprehensive response to the FOIL request.

        "communication": "This is an appeal of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's response to my July 1, 2020 multipart request for various records concerning various recently deceased Chicagoans. In particular, I appeal the FBI's determinations for the following parts of my request:\r\n\r\n1. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Sister Sheila Lyne (1936/1937 \u2013 March 10, 2020), a former Chicago health commissioner and CEO of Mercy Hospital\"\r\n3. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Roy Larson (1929/1930 \u2013 February 25, 2020), a former Chicago Sun-Times religion reporter, best known for his investigations of Cardinal John Cody\"\r\n6. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Barbara O\u2019Connor (April 28, 1930 \u2013 January 12, 2020), a well-known Hyde Park community activist\"\r\n7. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning John LaPlante (1940/1941 \u2013 March 21, 2020), Chicago\u2019s\u2019s first transportation commissioner\"\r\n8. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Rosalie Clark (April 16, 1925 \u2013 June 26, 2020), Chicago\u2019s\u2019s director of protocol\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 6 of my request, related to Barbara O\u2019Connor, and assigned it FOIPA #1469797-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 7 of my request, related to John LaPlante, and assigned it FOIPA #1469856-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 8 of my request, related to Rosalie Clark, and assigned it FOIPA #1469870-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 21, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 1 of my request, related to Sister Sheila Lyne, and assigned it FOIPA #1469883-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 21, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 3 of my request, related to Roy Larson, and assigned it FOIPA #1470034-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\n\r\nI appeal the integrity of the FBI's search to each of these parts of these requests. In particular, I specifically asked for a search outside of the CRS as well and it is unclear whether the FBI performed such a search. Lyne, LaPlante, and Clark were in or around City Hall during the time period of FBI investigations of high-ranking Chicago politicians and it is likely that their name appears, at minimum, as cross-references in such files. Larson was involved in investigations of Cardinal John Cody; as Cody was subject to several federal investigations during his time in Chicago, it is likely that Larson's name, at minimum, appears as cross-references in these files. O'Connor was a well-known Hyde Park political activist and helped elect Mayor Harold Washington and President Obama; her name potentially appears in the files of Chicago officials or politicians.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nShreyas Gandlur",

Please search all of her CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has conducted an e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request. This search yielded 2,550 search results. As written, it has been determined that your request is unduly burdensome to the District pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g). In order to comply with this request, the CPS would have to review each of the 2,550 lines of data, each of which may include student information, sender and recipient email addresses, and subject line content that would have to be\u00a0reviewed to determine if it is exempt from disclosure. Due to the job function of Ms. Arceo, this data contains a significant amount of personal information and student information contained in the subject line and sender and recipient lines, requiring a careful and timely review. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS. This is not a denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow your request, you may wish to narrow the timeframe of the search or specify a subject matter or keywords to filter the search by. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

His company is called Navy Yard Hospitality, I believe. \r\nI am interested in knowing if Massport has had any jurisdiction over the development of that site, including the gangway to the ship. \r\nThe City of Boston\u2019s Inspectional Services said it was not under their jurisdiction, and suggested I contact your office. \r\nI also know that the Project was done under the regulations for Massachusetts (Chapter 91). I am interested in any architectural drawings, Permit applications and Permits related to the gangway leading from the Pier up to the ship.\r\nPlease let me know if this is in your jurisdiction, and how I can get access to the building permit documents for that restaurant.\r\nThank You,\r\nVictor A. Popp, PE \r\n \r\nVPOPP Inc.\r\n75 Gardner St.; Hingham, MA 02043\r\n781-875-1085 Office\r\n781-264-7769 Cell Phone\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nVictor Popp, PE",
