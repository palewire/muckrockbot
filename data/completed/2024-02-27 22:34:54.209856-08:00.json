Pursuant to the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., you requested the following:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.\tAll communications between the Office of the Pardon Attorney\r\nand the White House from July 28, 2017 to August 31, 2017\r\n2.\tAgency records related to pardon or commutation requests\r\ntransmitted to the White House from July 28, 2017 to August 31, 2017\r\n3.\tAll records received from the White House regarding\r\ncommutations and pardons from July 28, 2017 to August 31, 2017\r\n4.\tA list of all commutations or pardons granted by President\r\nDonald J. Trump\r\n5.\tAll records related to Joe Arpaio received, sent, or maintained\r\nby the Office of the Pardon Attorney\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to requests numbers 1, 2, and 3 above, please be advised\r\nonce again that deliberative (pre-decisional) communications pertaining\r\nto agency and presidential decision-making are confidential and not\r\navailable under existing case law interpreting the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act and Privacy Act.  In addition, pursuant to 28 CFR \u00a7 1.5\r\n<https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2001-title28-vol1/pdf/CFR-2001-title2\r\n8-vol1-sec1-5.pdf> , petitions, reports, memoranda, and communications\r\nsubmitted or furnished in connection with the consideration of a\r\npetition for executive clemency generally shall be available only to\r\nthe officials concerned with the consideration of the petition.\r\nMoreover, as a general matter, Presidents in recent times have rarely\r\nannounced their reasons for granting or denying clemency, although the\r\nPresident may choose to do so in a given case.  Consistent with\r\nlong-standing policy, if the President does not issue a public\r\nstatement concerning his action in a clemency matter, no explanation is\r\nprovided by the Department of Justice.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on my understanding of your request and the fact that OPA does\r\nnot have the ability to perform broad and conclusive email searches\r\nin-house, I will have to request a search be conducted across emails to\r\nor from all OPA employees by the Department of Justice's Office of the\r\nChief Information Officer (OCIO), so your request falls within \"unusual\r\ncircumstances.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Because of these\r\nunusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to\r\nyour request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\r\nUntil OCIO completes a search to determine whether there are any\r\nrecords within the scope of your request, I will be unable to review\r\nresponsive records and provide an estimated response time.  The time\r\nneeded to process your request will depend on the number of data\r\nrequests in queue prior to yours, the complexity of their records\r\nsearch, and the volume of any records located as being potentially\r\nresponsive.  For your information, this Office assigns incoming\r\nrequests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited.  Each\r\nrequest is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to\r\nother requests within the same track.  Simple requests usually receive\r\na response within one month, whereas complex requests take longer. At\r\nthis time, your request has been assigned to the complex track because\r\nit is not one that can be responded to without the assistance of\r\nanother DOJ office.  You may feel free to inquire back about the status\r\nof your request at any point, but I can assure you that I will review\r\nand provide a response to your request as soon as the results of the\r\nsearch have been provided to me and I am able to review any potentially\r\nrelevant records for responsiveness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to request number 4 above, please be advised once again\r\nthat there is no need to FOIA this information because it is publicly\r\navailable and proactively disclosed on our website at\r\nhttps://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients> .  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to request number 5 above, the only releasable document\r\nwithin our files at this time is the clemency warrant signed by the\r\npresident, but it has also been proactively released and can be\r\ndownloaded from our website at\r\nhttps://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump>\r\n  You may have read news reports indicating that Mr. Arpaio did not\r\nsubmit a pardon petition through the Department of Justice so we did\r\nnot have a clemency casefile created for him, which is where we would\r\nhouse all records related to his petition, had one been submitted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou may email this office at PardonAttorneyFOIA@usdoj.gov\r\n<mailto:PardonAttorneyFOIA@usdoj.gov>  for any further assistance with\r\nyour FOIA request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of\r\nGovernment Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services\r\nthey offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of\r\nGovernment Information Services, National Archives and Records\r\nAdministration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland\r\n20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov <mailto:ogis@nara.gov> ; telephone\r\nat 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at\r\n202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWilliam N.

Legislature.\u00a0 The Court determined that each individual legislators\u2019 office is considered an \"agency\" for the purposes of the public records act (PRA) and therefore each individual legislators' office is subject to the disclosure requirements of the PRA, but not the Senate or House as an institutional body. \r\n\r\nPlease note that a specific and much more narrow definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d applies to the Chief Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate.\u00a0 For the Office of the Chief Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate, which includes staff of both legislative bodies, RCW 42.56.010 and RCW 40.14.100 define the scope of that term. \r\n\r\nAlso, the crime free rental housing program that you seek records about was codified in RCW 35.106.020, not RCW 25.106.020 as you cite in your request.\u00a0 I will assume this is just a typographical error on your part unless you are seeking records for some other program. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you are more likely to find responsive public records with local governments since the crime free rental housing program applies to local governments.\u00a0 Once we receive your clarification we will make a diligent search for senate records.\u00a0 However, you may consider submitting your request to local governments that have adopted these programs, or to the State Auditor who may have records related to an audit or other report. \r\n\r\nThe adoption of a program is voluntary, so not all local governments may have a program.\u00a0 The Association of Washington Cities (AWC) and the Washington State Association of Counties (WSAC) represent local governments.\u00a0 AWC & WSAC may know which cities and counties have adopted such programs, and you may ask AWC & WSAC for a list of local governments that have adopted a program, and then you can make individual public records requests to those local governments. \r\n\r\nYour clarification is needed to specify which senators or representatives that you would like records from for this request.\u00a0 We will close this request unless you provide clarification by January 22, 2024.\u00a0 After the request is closed, you may submit a new request to receive additional records. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSenate Public Records",

When a requester does not review records, the request will be considered abandoned and closed. See also the Attorney General Model Rules at WAC 44-14-04005. If a request is closed due to abandonment, a requester may submit a new request for any additional records.  The purpose for closing an abandoned request is for records management and efficiency of agency resources. We want to use our resources to fulfill requests that have not been abandoned.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

This document contains all or most of the information you are seeking. In addition, you can find Annual Analysis documents from 2010-2022 on our website here: https://www.clallamcountywa.gov/Archive.aspx?AMID=50\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I informed you previously, your request does not appear to be seeking specific identifiable records and lacks necessary criteria to perform a search for public records. A request under the state's public records act must be for an identifiable public record. If the 2022 Annual Analysis document does not satisfy your request, please identify the records you are seeking so that we may perform a search for records. If we do not receive clarification within 30 days of today's date we will consider this request abandoned and it will be closed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request under the state's public records act must be for an identifiable public record. Hangartner v. City of Seattle, 151 Wn.2d 439, 447-48, 90 P.3d 26 (2004). A mere request for information does not so qualify. Wood v. Lowe, 102 Wn. App. 872, 879, 10 P.3d 494 (2000); Bonamy v. City of Seattle, 92 Wn. App. 403, 410-12, 960 P.2d 447 (1998), review denied, 137 Wn.2d 1012 (1999). Additionally, local governments are not required to create documents in order to comply with a request for specific information. Citizens for Fair Share v. State Dept. of Corrections, 117 Wn.

I hereby request the following records:\n\nDocumentation describing the email system(s) used by your agency, including the procedures and methods for performing searches of the email system.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJoseph Steinbach\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoseph Steinbach",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

The agency\u2019s FOIA backlog \u2014 a longstanding, widely acknowledge concern for Congress \u2014 will be reduced by affirmative identification of frequently requested records. The agency will get fewer requests by making more of the frequently requested materials more easily accessible. Agency FOIA reviewers will not have to reinvent the wheel in processing redactions and determine which exemptions apply. And the public will get more complete and timely access to information because the agency will have posted it.\r\n\r\nThis is not an aspirational goal; it is the law. \r\n\r\n5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) requires agencies to post records that have been requested 3 or more times. The \u201cBeetlejuice Provision\u201d, if you will. \r\n\r\nOur review of your agency\u2019s public FOIA reading room, and a comparison of the publicly available FOIA logs your agency publishes, reveals that a number of thrice-requested materials appear to be missing. Consequently, we file this request to understand the process by which your agency determines what to include under the Beetlejuice Provision.\r\n\r\n1. Please provide all calendar entries, meeting minutes, attendee lists, working papers (or similar documents), slide decks or presentations, and follow-up calendar items for any meeting your agency\u2019s FOIA Officer or designee held to consider the agency\u2019s affirmative releases and proactive disclosures under the Beetlejuice Provision.\r\n\r\n2. Please provide any record reflecting your agency\u2019s FOIA Officers\u2019 identification of a record that may be eligible for release based upon the Beetlejuice Provision because it has been requested three times under paragraph 3. If the records requested are kept in an electronic system of records, like eFOIAExpress, we would accept a printout of requests designated as potential subject to proactive release under the Beetlejuice Provision in lieu of records responsive to this Item. \r\n\r\n3. Any guidance your agency issued for FOIA professionals regarding identification of requests that are potentially subject to proactive release under the Beetlejuice Provision.\r\n\r\nPlease task a search period beginning on January 1, 2022, and ending May 18, 2022. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

DCYF will also be working closely with the Department of Health which provides oversight for the behavioral and substance treatment centers to provide them with information about CPS investigations at these locations.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about reporting suspected child abuse or neglect, visit https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/safety/report-abuse.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

That support level would increase based on additional needs of the child, including support for adolescents, chronic physical health, developmental disabilities, and mental health.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Caregiver Support Rates chart [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2023/12/28/file_attachments/2731309/Caregiver%20Supports%20Rates.pdf ] \r\n\r\n\"We know that caregivers who have children and youth with higher needs, need more support to care for them,\" said DCYF Secretary Ross Hunter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, DCYF is changing its rate assessment process. DCYF will begin to use the child\u2019s case file, information gathered from the child, parents, family, and other important individuals in the child\u2019s life, and health history information to determine support level.\r\n\r\nIf a caregiver believes information about the child's needs was not considered in a level determination, they have the opportunity to appeal. Caregivers can request rate determination review any time there is a change in circumstances or a new diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\"The new process will help us identify\u00a0a child\u2019s needs and help us link caregivers to the supports that are best suited for the child in their care,\" explained Hunter. \"By better preparing\u00a0caregivers to support children and youth placed in their care, we should see an increase in placement stability.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\nDCYF has removed barriers for kinship caregivers to become licensed to care for the children in their home. If they have an approved home study, kin most likely already meet the requirements for a kinship license. Once licensed, the children in their care are eligible to receive monthly foster care maintenance payments to assist in meeting their needs.\r\n\r\nLastly, caregivers licensed by child placing agencies will begin to be paid directly by DCYF.\u00a0The new caregiver supports model marks the first time the rates and process have undergone major changes in over two decades.\u00a0The change is part of a larger project aimed at implementing a continuum of placement resources that enable safe, stable, and supported placements for children in the care of DCYF.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo learn more about DCYF's Caregiver Supports project, visit:\u00a0*https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project* [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project ].\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

It is likewise a serious barrier to reunifying children with their parents,\" Washington State Court Administrator Dawn Marie Rubio said at the signing ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Office of the Courts played a critical role to bring all three branches of government together to come to this agreement.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOver the years, there has been a lack of capacity in parts of the state, but through this partnership, DCYF and public housing authority and non-profits will now be able to serve more youth and families with housing statewide. Eligible families and youth will receive referrals from their DCYF caseworker to a contracted provider who will help them locate housing that accepts vouchers.\r\n\r\nMichael Mirra, retired executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority and co-chair of the Housing and Child Welfare Subcommittee, said the agreement will imbed housing into the child welfare system. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will spare children and families from the trauma of avoidable out-of-home placement, it will house teenagers coming from foster care or juvenile rehabilitation who would otherwise start their independent adulthood by becoming homeless, it will help the state\u2019s child welfare workers perform what may be the hardest job in public service; and it will save the state money in averted foster care costs,\u201d he explained.\r\n\r\nLowel Krueger, executive director of the Yakima Housing Authority said folks from the Association of Washington Housing Authorities were grateful for all of the partners who \"persisted in establishing this innovative collaboration to provide families involved in the child welfare system with housing, a critical first step in helping families and changing life outcomes for children.\"\r\n\r\nDCYF\u2019s ability to begin to provide the contracted Housing Supportive Services that are necessary to fulfill its commitment to HUD was made possible through $8 million in investments from the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited to sign this historic document with all the partnerships and what it means for the families we serve,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cWhen our youth and families are supported, they thrive, preventing deeper penetration into the child welfare system.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter with folks from the Housing Authorities photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787090/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20with%20folks%20from%20the%20Housing%20Authorities.jpg ]\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter Signing MOU photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787091/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20Signing%20MOU.jpg ]\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:*\r\n\r\nNancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, \u00a72.2-3704 et seq. for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnder the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, \u00a72.2-3704 et seq. I request the following public records:\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest separated by school, and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. If you claim such an exemption to my request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, please cite in writing the specific statutory exemption. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format (such as excel file (.xlsx) or other database form, or as .pdfs) and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Hannah Beckler.",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Also note that improperly addressed\r\n(i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the\r\ndepartment number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 11, 2024:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Public Records Request\r\nfor Data on School Policing (Stoneham Police Department)\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L.\r\nc.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under\r\nthe Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement\r\nagencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for\r\ncollecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court\r\nreferrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary\r\nEducation\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in\r\nthe 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that\r\ncollection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has\r\ndefined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the\r\nU.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any\r\nactivity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities\r\n(including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any\r\nschool official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law\r\nenforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is\r\nreported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school\r\npolice unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during\r\nschool-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of\r\nwhether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and\r\nschool-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7\r\n(twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes\r\neach school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted\r\nduring the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up\r\nuntil the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an\r\nextract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law\r\nenforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a\r\nstudent at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the\r\nyouth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please\r\nprovide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral\r\nto law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021,\r\nand 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the\r\npolice department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police\r\nplacement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n4. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise\r\ndescribing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with\r\nG.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5. The cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer\r\nto each school; and,\r\n\r\n6. The total number of school resource officers and total number of\r\nguidance counselors for each school in your district for school years\r\n2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7. The total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in\r\nyour district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019,\r\n2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and,\r\n\r\n8. A description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional\r\nhealth support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used\r\nfor any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this\r\nrequest be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this\r\nrequest is to determine whether your school district and police department\r\nare complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice\r\nReform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants\r\nare carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district\r\nmay have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.\r\nMoreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may\r\nnot assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for,\r\ncompiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.\r\nFinally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall\r\nassess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of\r\ncompiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In\r\nthe event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not\r\nwaive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good\r\nfaith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless\r\nthe record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within\r\nten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or\r\ndata responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not\r\nsubject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for\r\nsuch assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you\r\nbelieve apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be\r\nredacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of\r\nnamed individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to\r\nrespond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response\r\nto this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fstoneham-police-department-7741%252Fpublic-records-request-for-data-on-school-policing-stoneham-police-department-157091%252F%253Femail%253DPDrecordsrequest%252540stoneham-ma.gov&url_auth_token=AABKlAhrec3pOB0asmS1R0YOCac%3A1rTFGn%3An-a0Eta0k3_YiIsEJL3gDaK1YoBl9OWboXLCabrnppg\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nEVUMEGHH\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 157091-74631893@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 157091\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is\r\nbeing sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share,\r\nand manage public records requests.

Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 11, 2024:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Public Records Request for Data on School Policing (Stoneham Police Department)\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n4. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5. The cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and,\r\n\r\n6. The total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7. The total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and,\r\n\r\n8. A description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu.

After careful review, your request has been granted in part, denied in part.  We have redacted social security numbers, birthdates, personal addresses, telephone numbers, emails, and other personal information.  Pursuant to MCL 15.243 Sec. 13 (1)(a), this information is exempt from disclosure as it is \u201cof a personal nature and disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d All other requested information is enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal the items denied to the City Council in writing.  Such writing must specifically state the word \u201cAPPEAL\u201d and indicate the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial or seek judicial review in the Saginaw County Circuit Court within 180 days of the final determination to deny a request.  If the Council or Court determines a public record is not exempt from disclosure, it shall order its release or production.  If a Court determines that the City has been arbitrary and capricious in not disclosing a public record, it may award in addition to actual, compensatory, and punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total cost associated with responding to your request is $0.00.  You may find a copy of the City's FOIA policy and public summary on the City of Saginaw website at\r\nhttps://cms5.revize.com/revize/cityofsaginawmi/Documents%20Center/Government/City%20Manager/Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act/FOIA-Policy-Appendix.pdf<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fcms5.revize.com%2frevize%2fcityofsaginawmi%2fDocuments%2520Center%2fGovernment%2fCity%2520Manager%2fFreedom%2520of%2520Information%2520Act%2fFOIA-Policy-Appendix.pdf&c=E,1,S-Z6iIVgvjdI-LSUZPi4IQrxiHHjkRiAhnWGllp-BSxWfpy-_gyv_T-B7cjzqXx4UxT4X-MAPDvUyYdlK3Wgw1BXjk5-Rf0I9N3rx91Pt5XL&typo=1>.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (989) 759-1403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVicki L.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST OF February 04, 2024 - #R002636-020424 Dear Jennifer Pinsof, This message is in response to Public Records Act Request #R002636-020424\u00a0received by the City of San Leandro on February 04, 2024. Your request sought to access to the following records:\u00a0\u201c Dear Custodian of Records:\u201d \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023. \r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023. \r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJennifer Pinsof \r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/jpinsof/131963/table.pdf \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsan-leandro-police-department-5683%252Fsb34-alpr-data-sharing-san-leandro-police-department-158021%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAAZoOuP1Zpr28TevYED51ZIzkw%3A1rWqHk%3AJyj3ymOFftWQ73f2DluPUDkMlZ0FanTsKkRq8Y5AOeo The City of San Leandro has reviewed its files and has located records responsive to your request. These records have been made available through our online records portal ( Public Records Request - R002636-020424). (%5bCUST_ISSUES_HREF%5d) \r\nYour request has been fulfilled and is now closed.\u00a0If you have any questions, please contact me.

The agency acknowledged receiving this request on May 23, 2023, and produced records on February 8, 2024. \r\n\r\nPlease produce at minimum, \r\n\r\n(1) the FOIA tasker CBP FOIA created assigning this request, \r\n(2) the Daily Media Summary CBP FOIA created including this request, and \r\n(3) the processing form any custodians created indicated systems of records searched, time spent searching, search terms, the date the search was tasked, and the time period searched. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. The records CBP FOIA released on February 8, 2024, encompass 44 individual deaths over a 9-month period (rather than the 99.5-month period we sought). \r\n2. The records set contains least 8 in-custody CBP deaths for which no prior record of public release by CBP appears to exist, in contravention of the agency's Death Notifications policy. \r\n3. The records set omits several publicly reported in-custody CBP deaths during the 9-month the records encompass, apparently putting CBP in violation of its obligations under DCRA. \r\n4. The General Accountability Office has repeatedly concluded CBP needed to improve its death reporting mechanisms. \r\n5. In-custody CBP deaths and federal law enforcement agencies' noncompliance with DCRA have been subject of widespread media criticism, with repeat findings of the noncompliance. \r\n6. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately [ 0 ] pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-057084 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \r\nSincerely, \r\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

The following email from Missye Brickell on page 8 of PDF 1 (pages 1-112)from Intel which says \"... and CHIPS for America Act implementation relevant to OSTP\" appears to be the only relevant email and is basically what we are looking for (communication between Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, TSMC and OSTP relating to the CHIPS Act). PDF 2 also does not appear to have any relevant info (we are not looking for any climate related info).\r\n\r\nWould you be able to narrow the scope further and revert with emails, memos, communiques, presentations, similar to the one by Missye Brickell that specifically state the \"CHIPS for America Act\" or \"CHIPS Act\" or \"CHIPS\" or 'semiconductor subsidies' and originating from the following domain names: @intel.com, @nvidia.com, @nvidia.com @tsmc.com.

Unfortunately, the search request was submitted a few weeks ago. It covers June 1, 2021 through October 24, 2022. When we receive a FOIA request, we draft the search terms and parameters for submission to the e-discovery component. They, in turn, run the searches. Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that. But please keep in mind that we process FOIA requests on a first-in, first- out basis. Thus, the requests that were submitted ahead of the newly submitted one would have to be processed first.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA.\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Wednesday, December 7, 2022 5:40 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nDecember 7, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nApologies if I am mixing up the terminology.\r\n\r\nOn 1st December 2022 you stated that the \"The next interim production has not been processed.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Unfortunately, the search request was submitted a few weeks ago. It covers June 1, 2021 through October 24, 2022. When we receive a FOIA request, we draft the search terms and parameters for submission to the e-discovery component. They, in turn, run the searches. Those searches cover the specified time frame in the request or through the search date.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a new request to cover a different time frame, then you can do that. But please keep in mind that we process FOIA requests on a first-in, first- out basis. Thus, the requests that were submitted ahead of the newly submitted one would have to be processed first.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA.\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com> <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, December 7, 2022 5:40 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nDecember 7, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nApologies if I am mixing up the terminology.\r\n\r\nOn 1st December 2022 you stated that the \"The next interim production has not been processed.

We will make the necessary update based on the latest information. The newest submission will probably be consolidated with the existing request, but if anything changes, we will inform you.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\nDocuments are produced by family, so if either the cover email or attachment is responsive, both would be produced. Non-responsive attachments within the family group would also be produced. Additionally, documents that might have the terms in your request would be included in the production to avoid a later claim of search inadequacy. Those factors might explain the issue described in your earlier email about some of the records being \u201cirrelevant\u201d to your request.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are seeking documents similar to the one on page 8 of the interim production. However, all the documents have to be reviewed for responsiveness, so limiting responsiveness to similar records will not alter the timeline.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSTP processes FOIA requests on a first- in, first-out basis. We currently have a backlog of requests that we are working on. Based on that, the next interim production will probably be in about 4 weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any question or require additional assistance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA\r\n\r\nFrom: 124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com> <124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:124961-42098361@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 27, 2022 3:31 AM\r\nTo: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nCc: MBX OSTP FOIA <OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov<mailto:OSTPFOIA@ostp.eop.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: DC Freedom of Information Act Request #22-043\r\n\r\nOffice Of Science And Technology Policy, The White House\r\nFOIA Office\r\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave NW\r\nWashington, DC 20504\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 2022\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to request number 22-043:\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the help so far and any ETA on when you can let me know of the timeline on this and whether I need top open a new FOIA for this?\r\n\r\nOh and I noticed I mentioned \"originating\" in the request.

Specifically, I am requesting the following documents:All versions of the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including but not limited to Executive Order 13769 and any subsequent versions or ordersAny correspondence, memoranda, or other documents related to the development, implementation, or enforcement of the executive order, including communications between the White House and other agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Homeland SecurityAny internal reports or assessments conducted by the government on the impact of the executive order on individuals, families, and communities affected by the travel banAny records related to the waiver process for individuals seeking an exemption from the travel banAny other documents, including emails, letters, and reports, that pertain to the executive order restricting travel from Muslim-majority countriesThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes..  Your request was received in this office on 3/5/2023.  After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-HQFO-01118.  Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.  The status of your FOIA request is now available online and can be accessed at: https://foiarequest.dhs.gov/app/CheckStatus.aspx, by using this FOIA request number.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the determination regarding my FOIA request, dated March 5, 2023, to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I submitted a request for documents related to the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries in 2017, including Executive Order 13769 and any subsequent versions or orders. My request was acknowledged by your office in a letter dated April 21, 2023, which asserted that my request was too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records sought.\r\n\r\nAs advised in the April 21, 2023, letter, I am providing more specific details to enable government employees familiar with the subject area to locate the requested records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.\r\n\r\nAll signed versions of the executive order restricting travel from Muslim-majority countries, including Executive Order 13769, Executive Order 13780, and any subsequent or related orders.\r\nCorrespondence, memoranda, or other documents related to the development, implementation, or enforcement of the executive order, including communications between the White House and other agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State (DOS), and DHS. Limit the search to the dates between January 20, 2017, and December 31, 2018.\r\nInternal reports or assessments conducted by the government on the impact of the executive order on individuals, families, and communities affected by the travel ban. Limit the search to the dates between January 20, 2017, and December 31, 2018.\r\nRecords related to the waiver process for individuals seeking an exemption from the travel ban, including policy guidance, criteria, and statistics on the number of waivers granted and denied. Limit the search to the dates between January 20, 2017, and December 31, 2018.\r\nIn the interest of narrowing the scope of my request, I am no longer seeking any other documents, including emails, letters, and reports that pertain to the executive order.\r\n\r\nRegarding the burden of proof, it is the agency's responsibility to conduct an adequate search for records as specified under FOIA. In the case Weisberg v. U.S. Department of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the court established that the FOIA requires the agency to show, using \"reasonably detailed affidavits\" and \"a reasonable description of the records\" that they have conducted a thorough search for the requested records.\r\n\r\nBased on the revised scope of my request, I trust that DHS will be able to conduct a more targeted search for the requested records. Please consider this appeal and provide the requested information as promptly as possible. If you have any questions or need clarification please feel free to reach out.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter ",

You requested copies of any and all records related to the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries in 2017. Specifically, you am requesting the following documents: \n\nAll versions of the executive order signed by former President Donald Trump that restricted travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including but not limited to Executive Order 13769 and any subsequent versions or orders \nAny correspondence, memoranda, or other documents related to the development, implementation, or enforcement of the executive order, including communications between the White House and other agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Homeland Security \nAny internal reports or assessments conducted by the government on the impact of the executive order on individuals, families, and communities affected by the travel ban \nAny records related to the waiver process for individuals seeking an exemption from the travel ban \nAny other documents, including emails, letters, and reports, that pertain to the executive order restricting travel from Muslim-majority countries \n\nThis office received your request on 3/5/2023. \n\nInformation responsive to your request can be accessed online at \nExecutive Orders 13769 and 13780 | Homeland Security (dhs.gov) (https://www.dhs.gov/publication/executive-orders-13769-and-13780) \n\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), DHS need not make available under FOIA records that are publicly available. \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below who processed your request and refer to 2023-HQFO-01118. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\nRegards, \n\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office \nDepartment of Homeland Security \n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE \nMail Stop 0655 \nWashington, DC 20528-0655 \nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov \nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear\u00a0Jennifer Pinsof, \r\nThank you for your interest in the public records of the Livermore Police Department.\u00a0 Your request has been submitted and assigned the reference number P000336-020424\u00a0for tracking purposes. Records Requested: Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News.\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/jpinsof/131963/table.pdf\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Flivermore-police-department-12041%252Fsb34-alpr-data-sharing-livermore-police-department-158027%252F%253Femail%253DJMichelson%252540cityoflivermore.net&url_auth_token=AABABtIwJF7XBBA6GCoJnzqX4X8%3A1rWq8l%3A2jlWp4Yr640Zrx7D5J4z4aGdqfRpkebEpgKg8I14H2U \r\nThe request is being forwarded to the appropriate department(s) for processing. \r\n \r\nYou can monitor the request progress by using the link below. \u00a0The Livermore Police Department will email you when the request is complete.",
