        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to James Bradshaw Osgood. He was born on 6 April 1932 in New Castle, Pennsylvania, USA and died on 25 December 2004.\r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED\r\n\r\nOsgood sometimes used the alias Jim Bradford. Please include that name in your search.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\nOsgood was the past president of Mattachine Midwest, a gay rights organization based in Chicago.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\n\r\nAttached is Mr. Osgood's obituary from the Windy City Times.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of the FBI\u2019s records for the following organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Osgood: (1) Mattachine Midwest (2) Mattachine Society.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center and the Central Records Complex (CRC) in Winchester/Frederick County, Virginia. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, please produce all records related to the transfer or destruction. If previously-released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. If you nonetheless decide to charge me fees, please inform me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your processing of this request.",
