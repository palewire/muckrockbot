Kent was leader of the marijuana rights organization NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and provided legal representation to individual prosecuted on marijuana possession charges. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not needed as Norman Kent's death was widely reported in the media.  A copy of his obituary should be attached. Here's a link to an extensive news report on this death:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonblade.com/2023/04/13/norm-kent-co-founder-of-south-florida-gay-news-dies-at-73/\r\n\r\nOf particular interest would be bureau monitoring of Kent's writings in the Express Gay News or South Florida Gay News publications, as well as any records related to Kent's radio program.

According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Norman Elliott Kent.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's dedication to transparency, and I look forward to working as long as it takes to have any records, should they exist, be released.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A prior Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request, 1547783-000, was sent to the FBI for records on Christopher O. Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996), and the Bureau responded by identifying the aforementioned case file numbers as potentially responsive to the request and stating all subsequent records had been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Further, it recommended the filing of a FOIPA request through NARA's Special Access and Freedom of Information Act Program. Therefore, I am sending this request for access to FBI case files 105-HQ-8354  and 123-HQ-1568.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bird is identified in these records, there is no expectation of a violation of his privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Christopher O. Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996). Mr. Bird was a New York Times best-selling author who co-wrote \"The Secret Life of Plants: A Fascinating Account of the Physical, Emotional and Spiritual Relations Between Plants and Men\" with journalist Peter Tompkins in 1973. According to his New York Times obituary, attached, Mr. Bird served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media. A fee waiver is appropriate where disclosure of requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. Per Mr. Bird's obituary, he was in the Army at some point during the 1960s and/or the 1970s, based on the reference to the Vietnam War. This is important because he may have been on active-duty or in the reserve when his book \"The Secret Life of Plants\" was published. In the book, Mr. Bird discusses extrasensory perception and other unusual phenomena. Between 1972 and 1995, the Army was one of several branches of the military that participated in research involving extrasensory perception and remote viewing, first in collaboration with the Stanford Research Institute (later SRI International) and then as part of a program organized under the Defense Intelligence Agency known as the Star Gate Project.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Christopher O. Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996). Mr. Bird was a New York Times best-selling author who co-wrote \"The Secret Life of Plants: A Fascinating Account of the Physical, Emotional and Spiritual Relations Between Plants and Men\" with journalist Peter Tompkins in 1973. Mr. Bird served as an officer in the United States Air Force (USAF), and an author biography on the back of one of his books, \"Cubed Foot Gardening : Growing Vegetables in Raised Intensive Beds\", states he retired from service in 1993.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media. A fee waiver is appropriate where disclosure of requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. According to Mr. Bird's author biography on \"Cubed Foot Gardening\", he was in the Air Force for twenty years, meaning he may have been serving as an officer on active-duty or in the reserve when his book \"The Secret Life of Plants\" was published. In the book, Mr. Bird discusses extrasensory perception and other unusual phenomena. Between 1972 and 1995, the Air Force was one of several branches of the military that participated in research involving extrasensory perception and remote viewing, first in collaboration with the Stanford Research Institute (later SRI International) and then as part of a program organized under the Defense Intelligence Agency known as the Star Gate Project. Mr. Bird's USAF records would contribute greatly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the USAF in this area, both in regard to the type of work the USAF may have contributed to Star Gate (the program was discontinued in 1995) and possible budget appropriations for defense spending.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Bird's privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.

DeSantis, Et al., Florida 11th Circuit Court, 21-CA-18435 (lead defendant State of Florida)\r\n\r\nHuminski v. DeSantis, Et al., Florida 3rd District Court of Appeal, 3d21-1920\r\nThe Complaint in 21-CA-18435 contains the following text from a Florida Supreme Court filing along with per se evidence of prosecutorial forgery (pages 22-35 in link) of a court order used to initiate a contempt case (State v. Huminski) ,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis excerpt is grounded upon the following excerpt from a court order in State v. Huminski, 17-MM-815, forbidding communication, including service of court papers upon Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody which is part of the record in the aforementioned 2021-2022 State Court cases against DeSantis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis perpetual threat memorialized in the above court order prohibiting any communication with the entire State of Florida government (pages 63-64 in link) - FOR LIFE - is what DeSantis obsessively defended and sought to make permanent in 2021 and 2022.  \r\n\r\nDeSantis also defended the forgery by State's Attorney Amira Fox in his 2021-2022 defense filings that ultimately maintained the perpetual gag order protecting the entire State of Florida government from communication and service of court papers and perpetuated the fruits of the prosecutorial forgery of a court order enriching the State of Florida treasury.\r\n\r\nDuring this time period, notable is DeSantis' removal of State's Attorney Andrew Warren for his positions on LGBTQ and abortion issues while the governor was concurrently supporting the forgery of a Court order by G.O.P. State's Attorney Amira Fox that she used to initiate contempt case State v. Huminski and ultimately secured a lifetime speech prohibition gag order intending to obstruct the service of process upon Florida government attorneys including herself and the Florida Attorney General. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe cases that were obstructed by DeSantis' support, defense and cover-up of the lifetime speech prohibition intending to foil service upon Florida Attorney General, Amira Fox and government attorneys are (partial list),\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned 2021-2022 cases, Huminski v. DeSantis (lead defendant - State of Florida)\r\nAndrew Warren v. DeSantis, Florida Supreme Court, SC23-247\r\n Andrew Warren v. DeSantis, U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, 23-10459, Atlanta, GA\r\nEquality Florida v. DeSantis, U.S. District Court (Northern District of Florida), 4:22-cv-00134-AW-MJF\r\nThomas Kennedy v. DeSantis, U.S. Distict Court (Souther District of Florida), 1:22-cv-21827-KMW\r\nAndrew Warren v. DeSantis, U.S. District Court (Northern District of Florida), 4:22-cv-00302-RH-MAF\r\nAs a proximate result of the above gag order prohibiting speech with the entire government of Florida supported wholeheartedly by DeSantis and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody (DeSantis' attorney on the cases) in 2021-2022, service of court papers in the above listed 7 State and Federal court cases were obstructed in this conspiracy to violate rights and obstruct justice between DeSantis and his attorney general.  Serious official felonies under Federal and State law.  The impact upon the federal case in Georgia brings in an interstate element to the continuing crimes.\r\n\r\nWhere was DeSantis' ivy-league law education in 2021-2022 concerning the crimes of forgery, Obstruction of Justice and the obvious and implicit threat of prosecution and incarceration for contempt of a court order if the perpetual speech gag order is violated?\r\n\r\nIn a light most favorable to DeSantis, perhaps the above content does not set forth an accessory after-the-fact concerning felony Obstruction of Justice or forgery.  The inquiry then becomes why did DeSantis remove a progressive prosecutor, Andrew Warren, for his positions on LGBTQ and abortion issues while, at the same time, appointing Amira Fox to positions after her forgery of a Court order and per se Obstruction of Justice related to Federal and State court matters that pleased the Governor? \r\n\r\nA strong quid pro quo exists between DeSantis and his favorite GOP prosecutor, Amira Fox, who protected DeSantis' first major law enforcement appointee, Broward Sheriff Tony, from perjury charges.  Much more than party affiliation is behind DeSantis' motivations related to the forgery of a court order by Amira Fox and the gag order that was a product of the forgery.  A fruit of a very poisonous tree.\r\n\r\nAmira Fox's assistant in charge of the forgery and gag order request committed suicide 30 days after this corruption was detailed in federal court in Equality Florida v. DeSantis.  Amira Fox has admitted full responsibility for these official crimes in her own words here and here.  Not coincidently, Fox's deceased assistant who obeyed her order to forge court orders and seek a gag order was also the prosecutor who let DeSantis' appointee, Broward Sheriff Tony, off the hook for obvious perjury.\r\n\r\nSee https://desantisfelonycoverupcorruption.wordpress.com/2023/04/16/desantis-criminal-complaint-obstruction-of-justice/\r\n\r\nThe distribution list of this criminal complaint is as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom: scott huminski <s_huminski@live.com>\r\nSent: Sunday, April 16, 2023 1:28 PM\r\nTo: JCabou@perkinscoie.com <JCabou@perkinscoie.com>;

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

According to a study by Casetext and Stanford CodeX, GPT-4 scored approximately 297 points on the UBE, which is higher than the passing threshold for all UBE jurisdictions. This score places GPT-4 in the 90th percentile of test-takers.\r\n \r\nI am a pro se litigant who is interested in using Casetext's CoCounsel to prepare and file legal documents for my case. I understand that Casetext's CoCounsel does not provide legal advice or representation, and that I am solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of my documents.\r\n \r\nHowever, I am concerned that using Casetext's CoCounsel may be considered the unlicensed practice of law under Rule 10-2.1 of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, which defines the practice of law as \"the giving of legal advice or legal assistance to another person\". I am also aware that Rule 10-9.1 allows the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law to issue proposed formal advisory opinions concerning activities which may constitute the unlicensed practice of law.\r\n \r\nTherefore, I respectfully request that the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law issue a formal advisory opinion on whether pro se use of Casetext's CoCounsel would constitute the unlicensed practice of law in Florida.\r\n \r\nThank you for your time and attention.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nMichael Locke\r\n127 Delvalle St. \r\nMelbourne Beach, FL 32951 \r\nMbl22885@msn.com\r\n(321)506-9557\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke",
