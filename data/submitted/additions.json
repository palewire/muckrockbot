I am not aware of any provision of law that allows for the closure or withholding of these records. If a copy of these records is kept in an electronic format, I ask that you provide them to me in that electronic format. If either you or the public governmental body you represent contends that the documents I have requested \u2013 or any portion of those documents \u2013 are exempt from disclosure under Missouri\u2019s Sunshine Law, I ask you to comply with \u00a7 610.024, RSMo., and make available to me for review any part of the records that you believe to be not exempt. Additionally, I hereby rely upon \u00a7 610.023.4, RSMo., and ask you to provide a written statement identifying any basis upon which you consider the records to be exempt from disclosure, including the specific provision(s) of law that you believe to justify denying my access to those documents.\r\n\r\nThis request must \"be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received.\" \u00a7 610.023.3, RSMo. If you do not agree to make the requested records available within three days of receiving this request, I demand a \"detailed explanation of the cause for further delay.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGlenn Burleigh",
