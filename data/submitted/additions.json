        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAn export of data from all tables of Uniform Traffic Citation (UTC), Driving Under the Influence (DUI) UTC, UTC Disposition, Arrest- Offense data Fail to Comply (FTC) (D6), and Criminal Financial Oblication data from Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Citation/Adjudication Data System. I am requesting data starting in 2011 through the most recent year with full data availability in the system.\r\n\r\nFrom my research I believe that UTC data is administered by the FLHSMV based on the statutory authority 316.650, F.S. [found here: https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2017/316.650] and 322.20, F.S. [found here: http://m.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2018/322.20]. Based on information found in the Uniform Traffic Citation Procedures Manual [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/utccombinedmanual.pdf], the eCitation Interface Control Document [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/eCitation_Interface_Control_Document_6.1.pdf], the Traffic Citation Accounting Transmission System (TCATS) Interface Control Document (ICD) [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/tcats_icd_6_0_1.pdf] and the Uniform Traffic Citation Training presentation [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/2021_trcc_utc_grant_workshop.pdf] I understand UTC data is transmitted from issuing law enforcement agencies within five days of the offence date to the Florida Clerks of the Court (COC) for processing and are then validated and transferred via the Florida Court Clerks & Comptroller's Association (FCCC) Traffic Citation Accounting Transmission System (TCATS) to the FLHSMV within 10 days of disposition.\r\n\r\nMy request is for the validated UTC and disposition data that the FLHSMV currently has in its database(s). My request is for all non-exempt columns from tables in the FLHSMV citation/adjudication database which based on my research should include but is not limited to: \r\n\r\nUTC data values:\r\nDriver's License Number\r\nCheck Digit\r\nCitation Number\r\nType of Agency\r\nDate of Offense\r\nDHSMV Violation Code\r\nAccident Code\r\nActual Speed\r\nPosted Speed\r\nDisposition Date\r\nDisposition Verdict\r\nSentence of Court\r\nCivil Penalty/Fine\r\nCourt Costs\r\nDisposition County\r\nDisposition City\r\nType of Court\r\nBatch Number\r\nSupplemental Code\r\nType of Trial\r\nCourt Ordered Reexam\r\nCourt Revocation/Suspension Action\r\nLength of License Suspension/Revocation\r\nHauling Hazardous Materials Falg\r\nCommercial Vehicle Flag\r\nLicense Received Flag\r\nViolator First Name\r\nViolator Middle Name\r\nViolator Last Name\r\nViolator Suffix\r\nSex of Violator\r\nDate of Birth\r\nBlood Alcohol Level\r\n16 Passenger Vehicle\r\nDUI Violation \u2014 Passenger Under 18\r\nAddress\r\nCity of Residence\r\nSerious Bodily Injury\r\nMotorcycle\r\nState of Residence\r\nZip Code\r\nOOS Driver License Number\r\nOOS Driver License State\r\nSSN\r\nDepartment Court Code\r\nCourt Time\r\nRepresented by Counsel\r\nLicense Type\r\nLength of Interlock Restriction\r\nName Change\r\nCommercial DL\r\nPost Incarceration Length of Revocation\r\nBusiness\r\nCourt Ordered School\r\nFatal Injury\r\n\r\nD6 data values:\r\nDriver License Number\r\nItem Number\r\nTransaction Type\r\nSubrecord Type\r\nSubsystem Type\r\nDate of Failure to Comply\r\nSequence Number\r\nCourt Type\r\nRestore Date\r\nSurrender Date\r\nCreate Date\r\nReissue Date\r\nReason\r\nCourt Requirement Met\r\nOnfile Code 2\r\nCounty\r\nCity Code\r\nState\r\nTicket Number\r\nReissue Flag\r\nOffice Number\r\nBatch Number\r\nKey Punch Batch\r\nProcess D6 Flag\r\nPost Date Flag\r\nClearance Fee Flag\r\nOut of State D6\r\nTelephone Number\r\nCommercial Vehicle\r\nHazardous Material\r\nD6 Violation Offense\r\nD6 Violation Reason\r\nOOS License Number\r\nDriver License First Name\r\nDriver License Middle Name\r\nDriver License Last Name\r\nDriver License Suffix\r\nDriver License Sex\r\nDriver License Date of Birth\r\nDriver License Mailing Street\r\nDriver License Mailing City\r\nDriver License Mailing State\r\nDriver License Mailing Zip\r\n16 Passenger Vehicle\r\nBusiness\r\nDriver License Class\r\n\r\nArrest record data values:\r\nUpdate Type\r\nCitation Number\r\nCheck Digit\r\nCounty Number\r\nJurisdiction Number\r\nCity Name\r\nIssue Agency Type\r\nIssue Agency Code\r\nIssue Agency Name\r\nDay of Week\r\nOffense Date\r\nOffense Time\r\nOffense Time (am/pm)\r\nDriver \u2014 First Name\r\nDriver \u2014 Last Name\r\nDriver \u2014 Suffix\r\nStreet Address\r\nAddress diff than Driver License\r\nCity\r\nState of Driver's Address\r\nZip Code\r\nTelephone\r\nBirth Date\r\nRace\r\nSex\r\nHeight\r\nDriver License Number\r\nDriver License State\r\nDriver License Class\r\nViolation \u2014 Expired DL\r\nCommercial Vehicle Code\r\nVehicle Year\r\nVehicle Make\r\nVehicle Style\r\nVehicle Color\r\nHazardous Materials\r\nVehicle Tag Number\r\nVehicle Trailer Tag Number\r\nVehicle State\r\nVehicle Tag Expiration Year\r\nCompanion Citation\r\nViolation Location\r\nDistance \u2014 Feet\r\nDistance \u2014 Miles\r\nDirection N\r\nDirection S\r\nDirection E\r\nDirection W\r\nOf Node\r\nActual Speed\r\nPosted Speed\r\nHwy 4 Lane\r\nHwy Interstate\r\nViolation \u2014 Careless\r\nViolation \u2014 Device\r\nViolation \u2014 ROW\r\nViolation \u2014 Lane\r\nViolation \u2014 Passing\r\nViolation \u2014 Child Restraint\r\nViolation \u2014 DUI\r\nBlood Alcohol Level\r\nViolation Seatbelt\r\nViolation \u2014 Equipment\r\nViolation Tag \u2014 Less\r\nViolation Tag \u2014 More\r\nViolation \u2014 Insurance\r\nViolation \u2014 Expired Driver License\r\nViolation \u2014 Exp Dr. License More\r\nViolation \u2014 No Valid Driver License\r\nOther Comments\r\nViolation \u2014 Code\r\nFL DL Edit Override\r\nState Statue Indicator\r\nSection\r\nSub \u2014 Section\r\nCrash \u2014 Y/N\r\nProperty Damage \u2014 Y/N\r\nProperty Damage Amount\r\nInjury \u2014 Y/N\r\nSerious Injury \u2014 Y/N\r\nFatal Injury \u2014 Y/N\r\nMethod of Arrest\r\nCriminal Viol.

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, we additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdrian Nesta",
