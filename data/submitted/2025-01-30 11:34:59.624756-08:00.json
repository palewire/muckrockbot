[https://ussliberty.com]\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2005 the USS Liberty Veterans Association submitted \u201cA Report: War Crimes Committed Against U.S. Military Personnel, June 8, 1967\u201d to the Secretary of the Army in his capacity as Executive Agent for the Secretary of Defense. \r\n\r\nA copy of that report is at https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25497919-war-crimes-report-with-exhibits/.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense Law of War Manual requires \u201cDoD policy has required that the commander of any unit that obtains information about a reportable incident shall immediately report the incident through the applicable operational command and Military Department.\u201d [Paragraph 18.13.2, DoD Law of War Manual Page 1100]\r\n\r\nThe footnote on page 1100 states in part, \u201cAll reportable incidents committed by or against U.S. personnel, enemy persons, or any other individual are reported promptly, investigated thoroughly, and, where appropriate, remedied by corrective action.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe DoD Law of War Manual is at https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf.\r\n\r\nAn excerpt of the relevant passage in the Law of War Manual is attached.\r\n\r\nA reportable incident committed against U.S. personnel was reported to the Flag and other high-ranking US Navy officers serving on the US Navy Court of Inquiry when USS Liberty survivor Lloyd Painter testified under oath during the US Navy Court of Inquiry that he witnessed the IDF torpedo boats deliberately machine gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a copy of the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report, Painter noted that the portion of his testimony referenced above does not appear in the Report of the Court.\r\n\r\nIn his sworn deposition, Painter writes:\r\n\r\n\u201c1515 Hours: I climbed the ladder and opened the hatch to the main deck. I wanted to see if it was safe enough to bring the wounded sailors out onto the main deck. What I saw sent ice running through my veins. The life rafts were either destroyed or had been cut loose and had floated away. I personally observed an Israeli MTB methodically machine gun one of the Liberty's empty life rafts that had been cut loose and was floating in the water. I knew at that split second that the thrust of the IDF attack was to kill every American sailor on board. There were to be no survivors that day. I decided to leave all of the wounded sailors below decks for some measure of protection. I did not prepare to abandon ship.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe have attached a complete copy of Lloyd Painter\u2019s sworn deposition to this request.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting a copy of the investigation of the War Crimes investigation that is mandated by the Department of Defense Manual.\r\n\r\nWe are further requesting a copy of all records related to or mentioning our submission of \u201cA Report: War Crimes Committed Against U.S. Military Personnel, June 8, 1967\u201d\r\n\r\nWE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANOTHER COPY OF A US NAVY COURT OF INQUIRY REPORT BUT FOR THE REPORT OF THE MANDATED INVESTIGATION, CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOD LAW OF WAR MANUAL, ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN OUR WAR CRIMES REPORT WHICH WE SUBMITTED TO THE DOD ON JUNE 8, 2005.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If the EOIR in the last four years has been operating based on an untold number of \"secret\" policies that have guided its case adjudications, that information is absolutely critical for the public to know. It may inform every decision the agency has issued in the last four years. So, pursuant to the FOIA, I am asking for two things. \r\n\r\n1. Please produce all of the \"secret\" adjudications policies that Acting Director Owen references in PM25-02. And\r\n2. Expedite the processing of this FOIA request. Expedited treatment is critical, because until these secret policies are known, individuals will be unable to determine if they were unlawfully removed or ordered removed as a result of such secret, unfair, and according to Acting Director Own likely illegal policies are known. \r\n\r\nPlease promptly confirm receipt of this request, confirm that you have agreed to expedite it, and produce the records immediately. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
