The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Charles Leo Daniel, who died on March 7, 2024, at the GEO-owned Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between March 7, 2024, and April 17, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Charles Leo Daniel died in ICE custody on December 7, 2024.https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/trinidad-and-tobago-national-ice-custody-dies-nwipc\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Frankline Okpu, who died December 6, 2023, and before that, in the case of Salvador Vargas.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Daniel is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. Public records obtained by advocates in Washington State reveal Mr. Daniel spent nearly four years in solitary confinement at NWIPC, despite having a final order of removal prior to entering the facility. https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2024/03/15/nwdc-conditions-research-update-daniel-death-in-context/ \r\n7. Despite Congressional staff's presence at the facility on the day Mr. Daniel died, staffers found out via a news alert about his death. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/man-who-died-at-wa-detention-site-was-in-solitary-for-years-researchers-say/ \r\n8. Mr. Daniel's Solitary Confinement violated US and international law, which prohibit torture and cruel inhuman, and degrading treatment of detained people, including those with mental illness, via solitary confinement. https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/137-Harv.-L.-Rev.-F.-175.pdf\r\n9. At least 6 people have attempted suicide since Mr. Daniel's death, reflecting an acute mental health crisis within NWIPC. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/at-least-6-suicide-attempts-at-tacoma-ice-facility-911-calls-show/\r\n10. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Tacoma facility.\r\n11. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Daniel's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Daniel's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Tacoma facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 4/17/2024. Specifically, you requested records regarding the death of Charles Leo Daniel. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about Charles Leo Daniel.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in Charles Leo Daniel.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2024-ICFO-31579. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Robinson,\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your letter dated 4/18/2024, which constitutes the New York State Police's response to my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request regarding records related to \"COINTELPRO\", \"MK Ultra\", and \"Cointelpro 2.0\".\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to my request; however, I must express my dissatisfaction with the response provided. It is evident that the New York State Police's search for responsive records was insufficient, and I believe that relevant records exist within the agency's possession.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, my request sought access to a broad range of records pertaining to covert surveillance programs, counterintelligence operations, and domestic intelligence activities, including internal memoranda, operational blueprints, surveillance logs, intelligence reports, educational resources, budgetary documents, legal opinions, and post-operation analyses. These records are essential for fostering transparency and accountability regarding government activities that may impact civil liberties and constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of the requested records and the scope of the New York State Police's responsibilities, it is implausible that no responsive records exist. As such, I respectfully request that the agency conduct a more thorough and comprehensive search of its records systems to ensure that all responsive documents are identified and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of the FOIL.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to highlight the importance of expeditiously resolving this matter, as the information sought is of significant public interest and pertains to issues of civil liberties and government accountability. Timely access to these records is crucial for fostering informed public discourse and oversight of law enforcement activities.\r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, I hereby appeal the New York State Police's determination to deny access to responsive records and request that the agency undertake a diligent and exhaustive search for all records within the scope of my request. I also request that any identified records be promptly disclosed to me in accordance with the provisions of the FOIL.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this appeal and provide an estimated timeline for its review and resolution. Should you require any further clarification or information to facilitate the processing of my request, please do not hesitate to contact me directly at [Your Contact Information].\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEvan L. Rees",

You requested the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Internal memoranda, directives, and communications delineating the planning, execution, and objectives of such covert operations, inclusive of any allusions to MK Ultra or analogous programs.\r\n  *   Operational blueprints, strategies, and protocols dictating the conduct of surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities, encompassing any involvement or coordination with community policing endeavors.\r\n  *   Records chronicling surveillance operations, encompassing logs, reports, and warrants procured for monitoring targeted individuals or groups, alongside any watch lists or databases utilized for tracking.\r\n  *   Intelligence reports, evaluations, and analyses engendered as a consequence of surveillance and infiltration efforts, encompassing any evaluations concerning private contractors engaged in intelligence operations.\r\n  *   Educational resources, manuals, and protocols utilized to instruct personnel involved in covert operations, encompassing any materials pertaining to community alerts or coordination with neighborhood watch groups.\r\n  *   Budgetary documents germane to the financing and allocation of resources for covert surveillance and intelligence activities.\r\n  *   Legal opinions, guidelines, and interpretations pertinent to the legality and oversight of covert programs.\r\n  *   Post-operation analyses, appraisals, and evaluations undertaken to scrutinize the efficacy and ramifications of covert operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COPS Office does not maintain records such as those that you described.  The COPS Office is the grant-making component of the U.S. Department of Justice responsible for advancing the practice of community policing by the nation's state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources.  This Office maintains records pertaining to the application for, and award and monitoring of COPS grant funding.  The office also maintains records on its own administrative operations and procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FOIA operation for both the Department of Justice and the federal government is decentralized and each Department component and federal entity maintains and handles FOIA requests for its own records. Accordingly, you need to direct your letter to the office(s) you believe have records pertaining to the subject of your request. Additional information regarding the federal government\u2019s administration of the FOIA, including a listing of FOIA contact information, is available at www.foia.gov<http://www.foia.gov>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact the COPS Office FOIA Public Liaison at 202-514-1873 to discuss any aspect of your request. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like further information on the COPS Office, please visit our Internet site at https://www.cops.usdoj.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicole Lee\r\n\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\n",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
