Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), I request a prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\nMilner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011): This case established that FOIA's exemptions must be narrowly construed, and that any doubt about the applicability of an exemption should be resolved in favor of disclosure.\r\nPhillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009 (D.C. Cir. 1976): This case established the \"Glomar response,\" which allows an agency to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records in certain limited circumstances, such as where disclosure would compromise national security or reveal classified information.\r\n\r\nPlease note that if the NSA issues a Glomar response to this request, I reserve the right to challenge the response and seek judicial review. Additionally, I request that if any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, the NSA provide a written justification for the withholding that cites the specific FOIA exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Riggs, that were administratively closed, reversed, background check remand, and/or remand.\r\n\r\n2)  I would request any printouts, summaries, spreadsheets, reports, or other records or datasets that may encompass or address how many of removal orders included a negative credibility determination for any Respondent(s) for whom former-IJ George W. Riggs issued removal orders in protection/form I-589 cases (in other words, decisions on Asylum, Wittholding of Removal, or Relief under the Convention Against Torture), after merits/individual hearings occurred, between October 1, 2016 and the end of his tenure at EOIR.\r\n\r\n3) All correspondence or communications in any medium (including but not limited to any email, fax, letter, text/SMS/MMS, memorandum, voicemail, audio recording, sticky-note, or any attachment thereto, and any conversion of any of the foregoing from a digital to analog form/format, or vice-versa) to or from former-IJ George W. Riggs, from October 1, 2016 through the end of his tenure at EOIR, containing the words \"credibility,\" \"credible,\" \"incredible,\" \"incoherent,\" \"demeanor,\" \"candor,\" \"evasive,\" \"non-responsive,\" \"responsiveness,\" \"inconsistent,\" \"consistent,\" \"consistency,\" \"facial expression(s),\" \"body language,\" \"standard language,\" or \"addendum of law,\" or any abbreviation, contraction, misspelling, pluralization, or paraphrase thereof.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of each and every \"standard language addendum of law\" or any substantially similar 'boilerplate' or 'template' document utilized by former-IJ George W. Riggs as an exhibit in, as an attachment to, or as a drafting aid for any merits decision in a protection/form I-589 matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested records will be made available to the general public via a FOIA records clearinghouse, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes; rather, the results will be disseminated to interested individuals free of charge, and with no pecuniary gain to the Requestor, who is not (I hope and assume) the subject of any of these records.  Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business.  You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts.  Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA.  It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. \r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

CIA.\" These cases have addressed the importance of transparency and accountability in the FOIA process and the need for agencies to provide detailed explanations for their actions in closing or denying FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nI request that you do not withhold or redact any responsive records, as I intend to pursue all available legal remedies, including filing a lawsuit to compel the production of records, if necessary\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Every pilot must make this final check to ensure the general integrity of their aircraft. Here\u2019s a brief overview:\r\n\r\n\r\nCabin Inspection\r\nThe first step, check that you have the require paperwork. The acronym ARROW can help you remember the five documents you need to bring:\r\n\r\nAirworthiness Certificate\r\nRegistration Certificate\r\nRadio Station License (only required for operations outside the U.S.)\r\nOperating Handbook\r\nWeight and Balance Data\r\nLegally, these documents and certificates must be inside the aircraft, and the airworthiness certificate needs to be on display where passengers can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second step:\r\n\r\nMake sure the cockpit switches and valve toggles are in the right position.\r\nSwitch the battery on and record fuel gauge readings  to compare to your visual inspection later.\r\nTurn off the battery and make sure the magnetos are off.\r\nClean the cockpit of all trash and any unsecured tools and make sure your seatbelts aren\u2019t fraying or loose.\r\nIf your plane has fuses, find the location and number of spares.\r\nExterior Inspection\r\nAll pilots should do a walk-around of their aircraft before a flight even if it was recently serviced and approved, it is always a good idea to double check all components. Pre-flight inspections ensure nothing is damaged or overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Third step :\r\n\r\nLook for loose rivets, bolts, nuts and safety-wired devices and any residue around these items.\r\nCheck brake pads and discs for thickness and look for rust and grooves.\r\nCheck tires for wear and flats by rolling the plane forward and backward.\r\nCheck oleo struts for proper inflation.\r\nTest rigged controls for free movement with no chafing  don\u2019t forget to remove the control lock.\r\nMake sure control hinge fasteners are secure.\r\nCheck the propeller for oil leaks, significant damage and loose blades.\r\nInspect the engine check oil levels and make sure air intakes are free of debris.\r\nCheck the exhaust pipe  make sure it\u2019s free of oil and black buildup.\r\nFuel system Check the fuel quantity and compare to cockpit gauges, look for correct octane color and debris and make sure fuel vents aren\u2019t obstructed.\r\nDrain sumps and sample fuel  be sure fuel doesn\u2019t keep dripping after.\r\nClean your windows, inside and out.\r\nReview your aircraft\u2019s performance data and emergency procedures.\r\nOnce you complete a thorough preflight inspection, you can take to the air with confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: PreFlight pilot checklist\r\n\r\n1. I am making a request for pre- flight pilot checklist for international flight plan (FAA7233-4) from January 1, 2013 to November 31, 2013 for Singapore airline which is referred to \"Singapore airlines Limited\" and registration number: 9V-SKJ.

The maintenance requirements for these different types of uses vary, so it\u2019s crucial to know which one you\u2019re applying for and how to keep up with the right maintenance:\r\n\r\nStandard Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA approves applications for a standard airworthiness certificate if your registered aircraft complies with one of the following aircraft categories: normal, commuter, utility, transport or acrobatic.

For example, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (2019), the court ruled that the government could not withhold or redact records related to the CIA's use of drone strikes. Additionally, in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy (2020), the court ruled that the government must release certain records related to climate change policy.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to the following records:\r\n\r\nArchitectural drawings and blueprints of The Cadet Chapel, including any revisions or updates made over the past 10 years.\r\nRecords related to the construction and maintenance of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any contracts or agreements with contractors and vendors.\r\nRecords related to the funding of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any budget reports or financial statements.\r\nAny records related to events or ceremonies held at The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including guest lists, program materials, and photographs.\r\nTo facilitate your search for the requested documents, please let me know if there are any specific offices or departments that may hold the requested documents.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you do not redact, withhold, or delete any responsive records. If any documents are withheld or redacted, I will seek a court order to compel their release. Please note that the government's obligation to disclose records under FOIA is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, and I urge you to fully comply with my request.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make a special request for any records related to the history and significance of The Cadet Chapel at West Point. As a landmark building with a rich history, I am interested in learning more about the cultural and historical significance of The Cadet Chapel, and any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Because when you're part of the family, you want to make sure that everyone is taken care of (even if it means waiting in line for what feels like forever).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request any statistics or reports on the number of people who have fallen asleep while waiting in line at any of the NY DMV offices during the past five years. Because we all know that sometimes, waiting in line can feel like spending quality time with your second cousin twice removed (you know, the one who always falls asleep at family gatherings).\r\n\r\nIf possible, please include any information on the measures taken by the DMV to address long wait times and to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals waiting in line. Because we're all part of the same family here, and we want to make sure that everyone is treated with respect and care.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the importance of efficiency and accuracy in processing these requests, I couldn't help but wonder if any of your employees have ever felt the need for speed, so to speak. Any reports or records related to any high-speed pursuits, street racing incidents, or other dangerous activities involving DMV employees would be greatly appreciated (but we won't tell anyone, because family always sticks together).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v.

Specifically, I am requesting documents related to surveillance of the protest and any other relevant documents.\r\n\r\n***Please read this request carefully. Failure to comply with the request or provide all responsive records in a timely manner may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Mayor's Office, as well as seeking relief in court to compel the production of the responsive records.***\r\n\r\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests took place at various locations throughout New York City, including but not limited to Zuccotti Park (located in the Financial District), Foley Square (located in Lower Manhattan), Union Square (located in the East Village), Washington Square Park (located in Greenwich Village), Tompkins Square Park (located in the East Village), Bryant Park (located in Midtown Manhattan), City Hall Park (located in Lower Manhattan), Columbus Circle (located at the southwest corner of Central Park), Brooklyn Bridge (a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn), Times Square (located in Midtown Manhattan), and Grand Central Terminal (located in Midtown Manhattan).\r\n\r\nDuring this time, there were reports of excessive police force and other misconduct towards protestors by NYPD officers. As such, I request access to any and all records related to surveillance of the protests at these locations, including but not limited to, intelligence gathering, information sharing with other law enforcement agencies, and reports on any protest-related incidents. Additionally, I request documents related to the following specific events that took place at these locations:\r\n\r\nZuccotti Park: The initial encampment and general assembly of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\r\nFoley Square: The October 1, 2011, march and rally led by labor unions and community groups in support of Occupy Wall Street.\r\nUnion Square: The September 24, 2011, rally that was one of the largest protests during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\r\nWashington Square Park: The October 8, 2011, student-led rally in support of Occupy Wall Street.\r\nTompkins Square Park: The October 22, 2011, Occupy Halloween march and rally.\r\nBryant Park: The November 3, 2011, Bank Transfer Day protest.\r\nCity Hall Park: The November 15, 2011, eviction of the Occupy Wall Street encampment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am requesting access to any other relevant documents, including but not limited to, communications between NYPD personnel or with other agencies, memos, policies, procedures, training materials, and guidelines related to the surveillance of the protests. This request includes records that may have been generated by interagency collaboration or cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I request any video footage that may have been taken by NYPD Community Affairs officers during the Occupy Wall Street protests. Furthermore, I request access to any complaints filed against NYPD officers during the Occupy Wall Street protests that are related to their conduct towards protestors.\r\n\r\nI understand that locating responsive records may require the use of certain keywords and phrases. Therefore, I suggest that the following key strings be used in the search for responsive records:\r\n\r\nOccupy Wall Street\r\nOWS\r\nZuccotti Park\r\nFoley Square\r\nUnion Square\r\nWashington Square Park\r\nTompkins Square Park\r\nBryant Park\r\nCity Hall Park\r\nColumbus Circle\r\nBrooklyn Bridge\r\nTimes Square\r\nGrand Central Terminal\r\nCommunity Affairs\r\nComplaints\r\nSurveillance\r\nIntelligence gathering\r\nInformation sharing\r\nReports\r\nMemos\r\nPolicies\r\nProcedures\r\nTraining materials\r\nGuidelines\r\nI request that all responsive records be provided without redactions or deletions, unless a specific legal exemption applies. If records are withheld or redacted, I request that the basis for withholding or redaction be clearly stated, and that any segregable portions of the records be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request that the responsive documents be provided to me on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than waiting until all records have been compiled. This will enable me to more quickly review and analyze the records, as well as identify any additional documents that may be necessary to request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIL mandates that records be provided to the public, and withholding or redacting responsive records may only be done under specific legal exemptions. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, please provide the legal justification for doing so. Failure to comply with this request may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Mayor's Office, as well as seeking relief in court to compel the production of the responsive records.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to cite the following court cases and local laws to support my FOIA request:\r\n\r\nMatter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York, 735 N.Y.S.2d 380 (Sup. Ct. 2001)\r\nMatter of Daily News, L.P. v. New York City Police Dept., 15 N.Y.3d 385, 911 N.E.2d 1140 (2010)\r\nMatter of Murray v. City of New York, 107 A.D.3d 785, 967 N.Y.S.2d 462 (2d Dep't 2013)\r\nNew York Public Officers Law, Article 6\r\n\r\nThese cases and laws establish that FOIL requires government agencies to provide requested records unless they fall under specific exemptions, and that the exemptions must be narrowly construed. Therefore, I urge the NYPD to comply with my FOIA request and provide all responsive records in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

The incident involved several wrestlers and staff members of the WWE who were traveling on a chartered flight from London to the United States.\r\n\r\nAs you may be aware, the incident became chaotic and resulted in allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and other inappropriate behavior. These allegations were made public in a recent \"Dark Side of the Ring\" documentary by Vice, which has raised serious concerns about the safety and well-being of those involved. I have attached a copy of this article to this request for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned citizen and journalist, I believe it is important to understand the full extent of this incident and any related investigations that may have taken place. Therefore, I request access to any and all records related to this incident, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny FBI investigation or inquiry into the incident\r\nWitness statements and interviews conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies\r\nCorrespondence between the FBI and the WWE or its employees regarding the incident\r\nAny reports or memoranda created as a result of the investigation\r\nAny other documents or information related to the incident or any subsequent investigations\r\nAny other incidents involving the WWE/WWF and allegations of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior\r\nAny other investigations conducted by the FBI into the WWE/WWF or its employees\r\nIn addition, I request that the FBI conduct an interagency search for any records that may be in the possession of other government agencies, such as the Department of Justice or the Department of Transportation.\r\n\r\nI advise the FBI not to delete, redact, or withhold any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\nFurthermore, I request that any redactions made to the records be kept to a minimum and that any exemptions claimed by the FBI be explained in detail.\r\n\r\nTo help facilitate the search for these records, I provide the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nWWE plane incident\r\nFlight from Hell\r\nSexual assault allegations WWE\r\nFBI investigation WWE\r\nWWE misconduct investigation\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo Chris Benoit, a professional wrestler who died on June 24, 2007, and his family. As you may be aware, Mr. Benoit was responsible for the deaths of his wife and son before taking his own life.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned citizen and journalist, I believe it is important to understand the full extent of any FBI investigations or inquiries into Chris Benoit and his family. Therefore, I request access to any and all records related to Chris Benoit, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny FBI investigation or inquiry into Chris Benoit or his family members\r\nWitness statements and interviews conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies related to Chris Benoit\r\nCorrespondence between the FBI and the WWE or its employees regarding Chris Benoit\r\nAny reports or memoranda created as a result of investigations related to Chris Benoit\r\nAny other documents or information related to Chris Benoit or any investigations related to him or his family, including Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records\r\nFor your reference, I have attached a copy of an article related to Chris Benoit to this request.\r\n\r\nI advise the FBI not to delete, redact, or withhold any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\nFurthermore, I request that any redactions made to the records be kept to a minimum and that any exemptions claimed by the FBI be explained in detail.\r\n\r\nTo help facilitate the search for these records, I provide the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nChris Benoit investigation\r\nWWE wrestler Chris Benoit\r\nBenoit family deaths\r\nFBI investigation WWE\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
