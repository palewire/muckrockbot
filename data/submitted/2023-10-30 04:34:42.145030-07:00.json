Requests for information and documents under the purview of the Army are referred to the proponent agency for appropriate handling in accordance with Army Regulation 25-55, The Army Freedom of Information Act program. The FOIA only provides the means by which the public can request specific documents from the Army.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA does not require Federal agencies to respond to questions, render opinions, do legal research, compile or analyze data, or conduct surveys for members of the public.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently unperfected as you are seeking data and not specific Army documents.  Absent a request for specific Army documents, we regret we will be unable to assist you.  Please advise what specific Army documents you are seeking, as well as the Army Activity in which you seek the documents.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, per AR 25-55, requesters must include a statement regarding their willingness to pay all fees or those up to a specified amount. Please keep in mind that this is just a statement regarding your willingness to pay fees; it does not mean that you will necessarily be charged fees. You can indicate that you are only willing to pay up to a certain amount (e.g. $5.00) and request to be contacted if the estimated fees exceed that amount. Alternatively, you may also request a fee waiver or reduction in fees. However, fees must be addressed before we can move forward with your request.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you respond back to this e-mail within the next 7 calendar days with the requested clarification, as well as your willingness to pay fees, or request a fee waiver.  If we do not hear back from you we will assume you are no longer interested in your FOIA request and your request will be administratively closed.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nDA FOIA Office",

These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased). Meanwhile the public interest in such the historical study of OCDETF cases has been established by reviews of the Management Information System by the National Archives.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",
