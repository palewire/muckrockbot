Police between 04/15/15 to 06/30/15.\r\n\r\nI'm not interested in individual traffic stop documents, but an accounting of all stops made during that period. Please provide these in the format in which they are currently stored in your system, which may be a database, spreadsheet, CSV file, or similar.\r\n\r\nIf any part of this request is denied, please cite the relevant provisions in state law which justify the denial.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nVal Martin",
