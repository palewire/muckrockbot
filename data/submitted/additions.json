        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1980, 21-year-old Helene Pruszynki was found stabbed to death in a field near Daniels Park Road. She had been abducted near her bus stop in Englewood, Colorado the night prior and she had also been sexually assaulted. In 2019, James Curtis Clanton was arrested for Helene\u2019s murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2020.  According to detectives in this case the department used a forensic psychic or a subject under hypnosis, among other tools, to help hunt down Prusynski's murderer.  I am looking for records reflecting the number of cases psychics or hypnosis has been used by the department since the year 2000.  Such records should include contracting records as well as investigatory records produced by the forensic psychic or the hypnosis .\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
