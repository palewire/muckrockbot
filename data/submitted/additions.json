Hanks is to receive the Sylvanus Thayer Award,  West Point\u2019s highest civilian honor. This week, Washington Post reported that West Point will cancel all of these celebratory activities. https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/06/tom-hanks-west-point/\r\n\r\nPlease produce all documents related to the cancellation of the events honoring Mr. Hanks. These would include, without limitation, all documents related to the decision to cancel the events. Please ensure that the documents are sufficient to identify all persons who made or participated in making the decision to cancel the events, and documents sufficient to identify all reasons for canceling the events. Responsive records would include, without limitation, emails, text messages, and any other electronic messages (e.g. Signal). Thank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
