I am a journalist with Insider, a news organization, whose mission is journalism in the public interest. This request is for news gathering purposes. I will use the records to inform the public through our reporting. I therefore request a waiver of all fees and charges pursuant to the Tennessee Open Records Act. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nAs I am making this request as a journalist and the information sought is in the public interest, I request that you expedite the production of responsive records. If previously released records are responsive to my request, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Tennessee Open Records Act. If you claim such an exemption to my request under the Tennessee Open Records Act, please cite in writing the specific statutory exemption. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Hannah Beckler.",
