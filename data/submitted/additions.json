I made my first request in 10/16/2016, second 10/19/2016, third, 11/19/2021, (see below) I request emails between or amongst Kerry Gilpin, Richard Ball, Thomas Grenham, James Jones, Michael Lyver, Mary McCauley, Anthony Thomas, Stephen Fennessy from Dec 16, 2016, that mention my name or sexual harassment and retaliation complaint, until Sept 14, 2018. This is not a law enforcement investigation that is subject to Bourgas, this is an administrative procedure, the materials I seek are also the product of an administrative procedure, emails of public officials. Transparency is of paramount importance to ensure our government agencies are working in a fair and just manner. Police transparency is crucial to public trust.\r\n\r\nPlease note a statement AUG 2021 from the spokesman for ATTORNEY GENERAL MAURA HEALEY: \r\n\u201cOur state\u2019s public records law is in place to ensure an open, accessible, and accountable government, especially important when it comes to promoting public confidence in law enforcement,\" said Jillian Fennimore, a spokesperson for Healey, in a statement. \"Following repeated failures by the Boston Police Department to produce these records, we are seeking an order from the court that they must be turned over.\u201d\r\n\r\nAttorney General MAURA HEALEY sued Boston PD for 10-year-old records of a Domestic Violence incident. In the interest of social justice in my 7-year-old case of SEXUAL HARASSMENT and RETALIATION, yet to be tried and my failed attempt over a seven year period.\r\n\r\nDaralyn Heywood\r\n\r\nFrom: Heywood, Daralyn (POL) \r\nSent: Wednesday, October 05, 2016 10:17 PM\r\nTo: Farrell, Sean (POL); Halpin, Michael (POL)\r\nSubject: Fw: HIU Case #2015-004\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\nI respectfully request all recordings, tapes, emails, notes, meeting minutes, roundtable discussions, and transcripts of my HIU Case 2015-004.\r\nThank You!\r\n\r\nKindly,\r\nSgt Daralyn Heywood #2449\r\nState Police South Yarmouth\r\nDaralyn\r\n\r\nFrom: Farrell, Sean (POL)\r\nSent: Wednesday, October 19, 2016 8:37:09 PM (UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)\r\nTo: Heywood, Daralyn (POL)\r\nCc: Halpin, Michael (POL); Lyver, Michael (POL)\r\nSubject: RE: HIU Case #2015-004\r\n\r\nSgt. Heywood: I received your request for additional information and transcripts from the Department relative to the above-referenced investigation. I apologize for the delay in this response.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the Department, as a courtesy and pursuant to applicable policies, previously provided you, as a complainant, with a copy of the Report in July. The Department, however, is denying your request for additional information.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, this investigation was an internal personnel investigation and, as such, is not subject to public release pursuant to G.L. c. 4, sec. 7, cl. 26 (c).\r\n\r\nSecond, the investigative exemption G.L. c. 4, \u00a77, cl. 26(f) exempts from public disclosure \u201cinvestigatory materials necessarily compiled out of the public view by law enforcement or other investigatory officials the disclosure of which materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest.\u201d The investigative exemption serves, in part, to encourage individuals to assist police investigations and provide information. It is also intended to allow investigative officials to provide an assurance of confidentiality to witnesses so that they will speak openly about matters under investigation. Bougas v. Chief of Police, 371 Mass. 59, 62 (1976). The disclosure of witness statements and transcripts by the Department in this instance may only serve to discourage witnesses in future investigations from assisting and disclosing information to this Department.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Department will not disseminate any additional information.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nSean W. Farrell, Esq.\r\nDeputy Chief Legal Counsel\r\nMassachusetts State Police\r\nGeneral Headquarters\r\n470 Worcester Road\r\nFramingham, MA 01702\r\nTel: (508) 820-2153\r\nFax: (508) 820-2649\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
