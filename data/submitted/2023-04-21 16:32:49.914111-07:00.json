        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to case file 94-HQ-50997, for the Campus Crusade for Christ, aka Cru. The group was founded by William R. Bright, aka Bill Bright (October 19, 1921 \u2013 July 19, 2003), as an evangelical ministry for college students in 1951. Some of the information in the case file is publicly available courtesy of writer Lerone A. Martin, who identifies communications between Campus Crusade leaders and former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in his book \"The Gospel of J. Edgar Hoover: How the FBI Aided and Abetted the Rise of White Christian Nationalism\", published in April 2023, but the file itself has not been made public. This would be of public interest for two reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, it would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. Hoover, per Martin, used the Campus Crusade as a vehicle to promote his personal and professional interests. The Campus Crusade distributed Bureau materials and Hoover's writing appeared in a 1962 issue of a Campus Crusade publication, The Collegiate Challenge, in an article titled \u201cFreedom Begins with Christ\u201d. The Campus Crusade's file would provide the public with a clearer understanding of J. Edgar Hoover's relationship with faith leaders during his tenure as FBI director.\r\n\r\nSecond, during its existence, the Campus Crusade has maintained associations with known domestic terrorist organizations such as the Covenant, the Sword, the Arm and the Lord (CSA), an anti-government militia group and member of the Christian identity movement which bought farmland from the Campus Crusade in the early 1980s (please see: 100-HQ-487200). Per the FBI case file on the CSA, the Bureau launched a multi-year investigation into the group, culminating in a 1985 raid on the property the CSA purchased from the Campus Crusade. The Campus Crusade's interactions with domestic terrorist organizations make it a subject of public interest.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Specifically, I am requesting any documents related to Mr. Turner's activities, communications, or associations that were collected, created, or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\nTo provide context, Hal Turner is a political commentator and radio host who has been involved in controversial and potentially illegal activities, including making threatening and harassing statements directed at public officials and journalists. He has also been linked to extremist and white supremacist groups.\r\n\r\nIn making this request, I cite the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and request a prompt response to this request, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Justice, 739 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2014): This case established that the FBI's Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) indices are subject to FOIA disclosure, and that requesters may seek a full integrity search of these indices using specific key strings related to the subject of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a full search of all FBI records systems, including ELSUR indices, for any records related to Hal Turner that fall within the scope of this request. Specifically, I request records related to:\r\n\r\nCommunications, meetings, or other interactions between Mr. Turner and FBI personnel or informants.\r\nAny investigations or surveillance activities related to Mr. Turner's activities, communications, or associations.\r\nAny records related to extremist or white supremacist groups with which Mr. Turner has been associated.\r\nTo facilitate the search, I request that the following key string be used: \"Hal Turner.\"\r\n\r\nI also remind you that any responsive records must be provided in their entirety and without redaction, unless a specific FOIA exemption applies. If any records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I request a written explanation for the withholding that cites the specific FOIA exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Riggs, that were administratively closed, reversed, background check remand, and/or remand.\r\n\r\n2)  I would request any printouts, summaries, spreadsheets, reports, or other records or datasets that may encompass or address how many of removal orders included a negative credibility determination for any Respondent(s) for whom former-IJ George W. Riggs issued removal orders in protection/form I-589 cases (in other words, decisions on Asylum, Wittholding of Removal, or Relief under the Convention Against Torture), after merits/individual hearings occurred, between October 1, 2016 and the end of his tenure at EOIR.\r\n\r\n3) All correspondence or communications in any medium (including but not limited to any email, fax, letter, text/SMS/MMS, memorandum, voicemail, audio recording, sticky-note, or any attachment thereto, and any conversion of any of the foregoing from a digital to analog form/format, or vice-versa) to or from former-IJ George W. Riggs, from October 1, 2016 through the end of his tenure at EOIR, containing the words \"credibility,\" \"credible,\" \"incredible,\" \"incoherent,\" \"demeanor,\" \"candor,\" \"evasive,\" \"non-responsive,\" \"responsiveness,\" \"inconsistent,\" \"consistent,\" \"consistency,\" \"facial expression(s),\" \"body language,\" \"standard language,\" or \"addendum of law,\" or any abbreviation, contraction, misspelling, pluralization, or paraphrase thereof.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of each and every \"standard language addendum of law\" or any substantially similar 'boilerplate' or 'template' document utilized by former-IJ George W. Riggs as an exhibit in, as an attachment to, or as a drafting aid for any merits decision in a protection/form I-589 matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested records will be made available to the general public via a FOIA records clearinghouse, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes; rather, the results will be disseminated to interested individuals free of charge, and with no pecuniary gain to the Requestor, who is not (I hope and assume) the subject of any of these records.  Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business.  You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts.  Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA.  It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. \r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request a ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request a ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit a ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting a ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>",

        "communication": "Dear Derrick Hensley, \r\n\r\nThis response acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\u00a0 Your request has been assigned control number 2023-49093. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the status of requests submitted through the Public Access Link (PAL) may be tracked at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx, and you will receive an email response to your request upon completion of processing. The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nFOIA Intake",
