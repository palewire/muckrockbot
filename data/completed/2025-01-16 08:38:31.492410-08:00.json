        "communication": "Dear U.S. Mint:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I appeal your search and claim of no records, and your violation of my form and format request.\r\n\r\nAs for form and format, you stated that you were providing one email, and sent it as a PDF. You did not claim any exemptions.\r\n\r\nBy exporting it to PDF, you disregarded my electronic form & format requests \u2014 and you additionally rasterized the record, which I specifically asked you not to do. OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization. I did not consent to you making new, worse records in this way.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email in one of the native electronic email formats listed; any email software will save to them easily.\r\n\r\nMy form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) & (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA & FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for your search and claim of no records, I believe you likely searched the \"FOIA inbox\" account foia@sss.gov. My request was about the chief FOIA officer's emails, i.e. the primary official @sss.gov email used by Craig T. Brown, \"regardless of subject matter\" \u2014 not about FOIA request emails, e.g. not about emails to or from foia@sss.gov. I therefore believe you did not search or provide the records identified, and appeal items 1-3 on that basis.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options.

These sightings, widely described as \u201cmystery drones\u201d or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), have been the subject of significant public interest and media coverage.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically seeks access to all records created, received, or modified between November 1, 2024, and the date of this request's fulfillment. To ensure the identification of all responsive materials, this request includes references to \"mystery drones,\" \"UAP,\" \"unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" \"unmanned aerial systems (UAS),\" \"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" \"aerial anomalies,\" or any similar terminology used to describe these aerial sightings.\r\n\r\nThe requested records include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAudio and Video Files: All audio or video files received, recorded, or obtained by the department related to these sightings. This includes recordings made by departmental surveillance equipment, body-worn cameras, dashboard cameras, or agency-operated drones, as well as media submitted by citizens, contractors, or third parties. I request the original or highest-resolution versions of these files and associated metadata, including timestamps, geolocation data, technical specifications of recording devices, and any embedded identifiers for classification, dissemination tracking, or chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAssociated Analyses and Documentation: All investigative reports, intelligence summaries, or briefings prepared in connection with these sightings. This includes assessments of their origin, behavior, or potential significance, such as whether they posed a security, safety, or privacy threat. I also request documentation of decisions or deliberations regarding the classification, distribution, or public disclosure of information related to these events.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Directives: All internal and inter-agency communications referencing these aerial phenomena, including any correspondence that references \"mystery drones,\" UAP, or similar terms. This includes records of communications with external entities, such as contractors, private organizations, foreign governments or international bodies, and federal, state, or local agencies involved in investigating or responding to these incidents.\r\n\r\nRecords of Federal Collaboration: All records documenting referrals, consultations, or information sharing with federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other relevant entities.\r\n\r\nIf the scope of this request is deemed overly broad, I am willing to work with your office to refine it to ensure the timely identification and release of responsive records. I also request that responsive records be provided in their original electronic format, preserving all metadata.\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the requested records are exempt under public records laws, I request that non-exempt portions be released. For any classified materials, I request a mandatory declassification review under applicable laws, including Executive Order 13526.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBill Gagnon",

McElwee: \n\nThis is a final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for entry-exit and/or I-94 records. \n\nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, CBP has determined that they are approved for release in their entirety, no deletions or exemptions have been applied. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2023-076128 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

Please log into your online account to retrieve the records. \r\n\r\nWhile the responsive records were disclosed, the Department has redacted information for privacy reasons. Where non-disclosable portions of public records are \u201creasonably segregable\u201d from the disclosable portions, the agency may withhold or redact the non-disclosable portions while producing the disclosable portions. Thus, redactions are permitted under the CPRA, as long as the basis for the redaction (specified exemption) is identified in the agency\u2019s response. See Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.525(a)-(b) American Civ. Liberties Union Found\u2019n v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 452-454. \r\n\r\nThe Department has asserted the following exemptions as legal authority to redact portions of our disclosed records: \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7922.000 - the records in question are exempt because, under the facts of this particular case, the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7927.705, read in conjunction with Article 1, \u00a7 1 of the California Constitution provides that personal information details are subject to privacy rights that make such information exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this CPRA request closed. \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCorr.

Appeal-  Huminski v. State, 2d19-1914, Florida 2 DCA, author: Chelsea N. Simms, esq, Ashley Moody, esq.   See below,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law please supply;\r\n\r\n    1. The document authored by your office or any other State prosecutorial authority (executive branch official) commencing the case State of Florida v. Huminski, 17-mm-815, Lee County \r\n         Court including the criminal information, indictment or any other document used to commence the case and secure standing by the State as a plaintiff,\r\n\r\n    2. The proof of service of the document in Para. 1 that was effectuated by a State of Florida prosecutorial authority (not a show cause order served by the judicial branch in a civil matter),\r\n\r\n    3. Any document related to the prosecution that contains a criminal statute that supports a criminal prosecution by the sovereign (not F.S. 900.04 which simply governs the conduct of a \r\n         judge to exercise contempt powers).\r\n\r\n    4.

Trial courts \u201clack jurisdiction\u201d until proper pleadings are filed. Lovett v. Lovett, 112 So. 768, 776 (Fla. 1927) accord Lewis v. Lewis, 78 So.2d 711, 712. A trial court's lack of subject-matter\r\njurisdiction makes its judgment void. NWT v. LHD (In re DNHW), 955 So.2d 1236, 1238 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007). A judgment of conviction that is entered against a defendant without service of a charging instrument is absent personal jurisdiction over the defendant and is regarded as a\r\nvoid judgment. Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Bevis, 652 So.2d 382, 383 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995).\r\n\r\nThe Florida Supreme Court has explained that \"jurisdiction to try an accused does not exist under article I, section 15 of the Florida Constitution unless there is an extant information, indictment, or presentment filed by the state.\" State v. Anderson, 537 So.2d 1373, 1374 (Fla.1989).\r\nSee, e.g., Ex parte Reed,101 Fla. 800, 135 So. 302, 303 (1931) (concluding that judgment of conviction by circuit court was void where indictment failed to show that the defendant was charged with a felony). Pope v. State, 268 So.2d 173, 175 (Fla. 2d DCA 1972) (explaining that an allegation of a felony \"is essential to the invocation of the jurisdiction of a felony court over the charge since the allegata of the accusatory writ are precisely the basis in the first instance upon which the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof is predicated\") \r\n\r\nA judgment entered without due service of process is void. See Gelkop v. Gelkop, 384 So.2d 195 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980); McAlice v. Kirsch, 368 So.2d 401 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979); Grahn v. Dade Home Services, Inc. 277 So.2d 544 (Fla. 3d DCA 1973). On motion, a court may, at any time, relieve a party from a void final judgment of conviction. See Sams Food Store, Inc. v. Alvarez, 443 So.2d 211 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983); Tucker v. Dianne Electric, Inc. 389 So.2d 683 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980); McAlice. See also Ramagli Realty Co. v. Craver, 121 So.2d 648 (Fla. 1960) (the passage of time cannot make valid that which has been void).\r\n  \r\nThe hearing of contempt is private to the allegedly offended court. See generally, South Dade Farms v. Peters , 88 So. 2D 891 (Florida Supreme Court 1956) ( approvingly citing \"There has been general recognition of the fact that the courts are clothed with this power, and must be authorized to exercise it without referring the issues of fact or law to another tribunal or to a jury in the same tribunal. \u2026 Bessette v. W.B. Conkey Co., 194 U.S. 324 337, 24 S.Ct. 665, 48 L.Ed. [997] 1005.\") and Huminski v. State, 2d19-1247 (Fl 2nd DCA, 2019)(adding emphasis to the statutory language \u201cagainst it\u201d concerning F.S. \u00a7 38.22).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After completion of the work, an invoice will be sent to you for the actual costs.  Payment can only be in the forms of cash, check or money order and must be the exact amount.  Please note this process may take up to 16 weeks.   Thank you.\nJody Brown\r\nAssistant State Attorney\r\n239-533-1228",

        "communication": "This Sunshine request has been limited to documents authored and filed by subordinates of Amira Dajani Fox in 17-mm-815 in the month of June, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Fl Attorney General needed no such astronomical anticipated payment for handling this request.  See their quite prompt and professional response here,\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/florida-34/amira-fox-20th-circuit-states-attorney-criminal-information-state-v-huminski-17-mm-815-office-of-the-attorney-general-florida-178818/#file-1250623\r\n\r\nEvading accountability is not appropriate conduct for the highest law enforcement official in the 20th Circuit.\r\n\r\nI need only one or two pages containing the papers that your office authored and served to initiate the the docketing and commencement of a criminal prosecution in 17-mm-815.    Arraignment was held on 6/29/2017 and 17-mm-815 was docketed on 6/30/2017.  If any document exists,  it would have been authored in June 2017.  Cases don't get docketed without a pleading from the plaintiff filed in court (see case law filed previously in this Sunshine request).  This request is narrowed to only June 2017.  See case law authority filed in this request that governs case initiation and jurisdiction mandating the existence of pleadings by a plaintiff necessary for subject-matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe full record on appeal is available to the public as listed in the links above.  Only June 2017 documents are sought in this request.  Please read the request and only consider producing the requested 1, 2 or 3 pages of documents that don't exist in the record on appeal, yet, caused the case to be docketed and prosecuted.  FYI, the record on appeal is at these links,\r\n\r\nhttps://edca.2dca.org/DcaDocs/2019/1914/2019-1914_Brief_530010_RC09.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201005171650/https://edca.2dca.org/DcaDocs/2019/1914/2019-1914_Brief_530010_RC09.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://www.indybay.org/uploads/2024/11/25/record_on_appeal_2019-1914_comp64mb.pdf\r\n\r\nThis request applies to only documents not currently in the record on appeal.  The public and myself has the record on appeal or has access to all documents in the record on appeal.  What is missing are the papers authored by your office that initiated the arraignment, docketing and commencement of the case in June 2017.  Less than 3 pages, if they exist at all.  Please respond with a non-frivolous response that has some basis in reality and limit the request to June 2017.  \r\n\r\nFurther only supply documents authored and filed by Amira Dajani Fox or her subordinates from 6/1/2017 to 6/30/2017.  Obviously,  this request seeks only case initiation and service documents (the request is withdrawn for any documents listing a criminal statute because none exist).  June 2017 documents only are requested.\r\n\r\nThe only documents that currently exist in the record on appeal for June 2017 are as follows (from the index of the record on appeal);\r\n01 12/21/2018 Case Summary/Progress Docket 21 - 51\r\n02 06/05/2017 Order to Show Cause 52 - 54\r\n03 06/29/2017 Court Minutes Held on 6-29-17 55 - 56\r\n04 07/10/2017 Order on Arraignment 57 - 58\r\n\r\nVery odd that the first entry in the record on appeal for 17-mm-815  is a \"Case Summary/Progress Docket\" (2018), the wrong year.  Also odd that an order from a Circuit Court civil case somehow got filed in 17-mm-815 as the 2nd docket entry absent the identity of the filing party.  Due Process is not about mysterious anonymous filings.   Docket entry 2 is also missing over 100 pages of attachments.  Court  minutes is the final docket entry in June 2017.  Corruptly missing is any paper authored and filed by the 20th Circuit State Attorney in June 2017, these are the missing papers \"ghost documents\"  that this request seeks.\r\n\r\nAs your office didn't become involved until 6/29/2017 (allegedly), the time frame involved in this request has been reduced to June 2017.  After all, criminal cases don't get initiated by slight-of-hand or smoke-and-mirrors so something happened first that is not in the record.  Those \"ghost documents\" are sought in this request.  Real court filings and service initiate cases in the Florida courts seemingly quite unlike 17-mm-815.  \r\n\r\nThe record on appeal is a .pdf searchable file and the prior document production estimated cost is an illegal tactic to evade accountability by inflating the alleged costs of document production.  A search on \"FS\" or \"F.S.\" amazingly reveals no responsive documents that contain a criminal statute exist in the record on appeal.  Regardless, the request for documents containing a Florida criminal statute has been withdrawn -- none exist pursuant to the official record on appeal.  That part of the document request is moot and has been withdrawn.\r\n\r\nNOTE : THIS DOCUMENT REQUEST HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE MONTH OF JUNE 2017 ONLY AS ARRAINGMENT WAS HELD ON 6/29/2017 and docketing began on 6/30/2017. PLEASE PRODUCE THE DOCUMENTS AUTHORED AND SERVED BY THE 20TH STATE'S ATTORNEY CAUSING/INITIATING STATE V. HUMINSKI, 17-MM-815 supporting the \"arraignment\" as described by the presiding judge.  Plaintiff State of Florida must have authored and filed something in June 2017 unless 17-mm-815 was purely an exercise in corruption, harassment, lawfare, manipulation of court dockets and weaponized justice.\r\n\r\nI will pay any fees related to the tiny involvement and documents authored, if any, by subordinates of Amira Dajani Fox in the month of June 2017. Criminal case don't just pop up on a docket absent participation of the plaintiff.   Absent such documentary support, the prosecution was a criminal fraud, unconstitutional, official crime and vastly unethical.  No documents satisfying this request exist in the record on appeal, no need to search there.  The records sought are not in the record on appeal and were authored in June 2017 that initiated 17-mm-815, if any.  This request seeks those ghost documents.  Ghost documents do not comply with Due Process under the State or Federal constitutions.\r\n\r\nPlease supply a new quotation involving only the month of June 2017 only.    As the record on appeal contains no papers authored or filed by Amira Dajani Fox Subordinates in June 2017, this request requires no substantial time to complete.    \r\n\r\nTHE ESSENCE OF THIS REQUEST IS JUST HOW DID AMIRA DAJANI FOX AND HER SUBORDINATES GET 17-MM-815 DOCKETED ON 6/30/2017 AND ARRAIGNED ON 6/29/2017.  Currently a mystery which is not consistent with the ethical and lawful litigation of anything in the United States.\r\n\r\nAttached is a draft writ of coram nobis / Motion to Vacate  that will be filed after your production of the requested documents or after a \"no responsive documents\" reply by your office.  The Writ is predicated upon zero filing of anything by Amira Dajani Fox subordinates in June 2017 and may be filed as an action in federal court (constitutional violations) although it currently contemplates a State Circuit Court or 2 DCA filing.  Your prompt and expedited response is required to advance the interests of justice involving an attack upon a hopelessly corrupt and void ab initio judgment of conviction.  \r\n\r\nRules and procedures need to be followed when initiating a court case, not behind-the-scenes corrupt manipulation of dockets by courthouse and State's Attorney staff.  At hearing, Anthony Kunasek (deceased) quite properly stated that a new docket number is not created for contempt matters.  At least one employee of the 20th Circuit State's Attorney knew some of the correct law governing contempt, but, he could not disobey the wishes of Amira Dajani Fox to advance a constitutionally infirm criminal prosecution.",

The FPS 2 develops models to identify fraud waste and abuse and monitor the models to validate effective alerting.\r\n\r\nI am seeking:\r\n\r\n1) Contracts, memorandums of understanding, and statements of work between the department and any outside party regarding the implementation and development of FPS2 of any service to detect or predict fraud\r\n\r\n2) Documentation of FPS 2 or predictive models that the agency currently uses (including those used as aids to human decision making). This documentation should include, where available: executive summaries of the algorithm/model's purpose, lists of the data sources, breakdowns of how the model weights various input data, descriptions of the statistical or machine learning techniques employed, the results of validation and accuracy testing, disparate impact studies, and algorithmic impact reports.\r\n\r\n3) A data dictionary/library for each predictive or detection model or algorithm identified in response to items 1 and 2 of this requests.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of any internal or independent audits of the identified models or algorithms.\r\n\r\n5) Aggregate or disaggregated data, if any exists, breaking down the risk scores or outputs of the fraud model.\r\n\r\n6) Training data code and model files for the above algorithms.\r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of information regarding the use of predictive analytics will contribute significantly to public understanding of how CMS uses advanced machine learning technology. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory\r\nexemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to\r\nonly a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and\r\nprovide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me or call\r\nme. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under the provisions of the Freedom of Information\r\nAct (5 U.S.C. Section 552).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Pieter van der Hurk, aka Peter Hurkos (May 21, 1911 \u2013 June 1, 1988). Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and psychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988. During this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he used this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson. Mr. Hurkos was himself arrested by the FBI on February 9, 1964, for impersonation of an FBI agent; he was found guilty and fined $1,000.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Hurkos's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). As noted above, Mr. Hurkos was a public figure arrested for impersonating a federal agent. Records pertaining to this investigation and the government's handling of it, along with any of Mr. Hurkos's other activities, would be of public interest. \r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the thousand oaks police Department\u2019s use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the Department\u2019s use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the department\u2019s aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the department used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the Department\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

This review includes determining whether any information should be withheld from disclosure under the exemptions set forth in NY Public Officers Law section 87(2).  I note that any emails or attachments which include proprietary, confidential, or business sensitive information are required to undergo an additional review by ICF as set forth in NY Public Officers Law section 89(5).  This additional review entails NYSERDA seeking a confidentiality justification letter from ICF, ICF reviewing each responsive email and attachment sent to it and drafting a letter to NYSERDA with its confidentiality assertions.\r\n\r\nGiven this, NYSERDA anticipates completing its review of the responsive records no later than August 30.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nColleen Dawson\r\nSenior Counsel\r\n\r\nNYSERDA\r\n17 Columbia Circle | Albany, NY 12203-6399\r\nP: 518-862-1090 ext. 3454 | C: 518-928-7510 | Email: Colleen.Dawson@nyserda.ny.gov<mailto:Colleen.Dawson@nyserda.ny.gov>\r\nnyserda.ny.gov<http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/>\r\nfollow : friend : connect with NYSERDA<http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/Social-Media>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0]\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0]<https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About>  [cid:image003.png@01DAC93A.F0F86DF0] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGqdNxvmqT0>\n",
