        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll documents, memoranda, e-mails, and reports issued or received by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) related to the NIH Study: Pierpaoli. Neuroimaging Findings in US Government Personnel and Their Family Members Involved in Anomalous Health Incidents. JAMA. Published March 18, 2024. doi:10.1001/jama.2024.2424\r\n\r\nBesides the doi address above, a web link to the study is https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816532 and the file of the published study is attached to this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nDocuments, memoranda, e-mails, and reports issued by or received by the IRB  related to the study should be collected from January 1, 2017 until December 9, 2024.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization. Targeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2). Targeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLen Ber MD\r\nGlobal Medical Leader\r\nBoard Member\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization\r\n\r\n417 Cardinal Dr.\r\nBloomingdale, IL 60108\r\n\r\nPh: 630-450-7014\r\ne-mail: lenber@protonmail.com\r\nWebsite: www.TargetedJustice.com",
