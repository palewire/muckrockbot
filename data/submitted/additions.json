        "communication": "Dear U.S. Department of Energy:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to DOE's mascot, Energy Ant. Specifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Energy Ant mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as all records related to DOE's decision to create a mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Energy Ant-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Energy Ant costume. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all correspondence related to Energy Ant (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007. Iowa Senator Jodi Ernst may also have sent responsive records.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all records related to any decision by DOE to stop using Energy Ant as part of its public outreach.\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a non-commercial project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be fulfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
