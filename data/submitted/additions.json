The organization, founded by Colonel Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f in the late 1960s, has been implicated in numerous acts of violence in Turkey and is outlawed in several European countries.\r\n\r\nIn response to FOIPA Request No. 1485823-000, the FBI has released documents mentioning the Gray Wolves as a suspect in the assassination attempt against Turkish prime minister Turgut \u00d6zal. (See the attached document.) I am requesting a search for other records related to the Gray Wolves. If any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please see the following as an example of an article I have written on a similar topic: https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/june-2023/inside-the-iranian-diaspora/\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",
