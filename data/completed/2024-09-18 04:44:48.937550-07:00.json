Such details may include the subject, timeframe, names of any individuals involved ... \"\r\n\r\nMy request asked for any records related the \"Belarusian Cyber Partisans,\" or the \"Cyber Partisans,\" which refers to a narrow and specific group and/or subject. I also specifically asked for \"any records - memos, emails, text messages, images or other material,\" which seems to be a clear and reasonable description of possible search options.  \r\n\r\nTherefore I believe that I very narrowly constructed my request to a limited number of records that would relate to the stated subject. It is inappropriate for this agency to issue such a letter so quickly after receiving the request. Please instruct the FOIA officers to complete a search for records before making such a determination.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of good faith, the only thing I neglected to add was a time frame. Please search for material dated between Jan. 1, 2020 and May 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAJ Vicens",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.

It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing John \"Sonny\"\r\n    Franzese Sr. (February 6, 1917 \u2013 February 24, 2020), who was an\r\n    Italian-American mobster who was a longtime member of the Colombo crime\r\n    family.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/us/politics/joseph-i-lieberman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If your FOIPA Number is [1195846-1] please enter [1195846-001] into the system. If you have any questions about the status of your FOIPA request, please e-mail foipaquestions@fbi.gov.\r\n\r\nFIND STATUS OF FOIPA- Request statuses are updated weekly\r\n\r\nPlease enter the whole FOIPA number-Example: [1234567-000]\r\n\r\nFOIPA:\r\nResults will show the Request Number, Case Type and Process Description shown below:\r\nFOIPA:\r\n1234567-000\r\nCase Type:\r\nFOIPA\r\nProcess Description (Will display the current progress of the request)\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOIPA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nYou may be contacted via formal letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Recent requests are entered into the FOIPA database in the order that they are received. Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

While I will not be using these records for commercial purposes as stated in my initial request, I requested copies of notices issued by the City and did not request a list of names. Your interpretation led you to creating a list of names presumably because the original records are not available. Following how you interpret RCW 42.56.070 to apply to my request for City-issued notices, I would expect all public records requests that yield records containing multiple names to be subject to this law. If I were to ask for emails sent by the Mayor's Office (which I have many times without being required to sign an affidavit), you would argue that because multiple senders and recipients appear in the records, I must sign your affidavit. May I remind you that the PRA is to be \"liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the law you cite (RCW 42.56.070(8)) only applies to \"lists of individuals\". As seen depicted in this article, the letter is addressed to \"Fortuna Sequitur LLC\" which is the entity that runs the Bait Shop business. Nowhere in this letter do I see the name of any individual listed, so I do not see why the list you are creating would be deemed \"a list of individuals\".\r\nhttps://www.kuow.org/stories/graffiti-was-carved-into-their-windows-the-city-wants-these-seattle-bars-to-fix-it-or-pay-up\r\n\r\nI respectfully ask that I be provided the full breadth of requested information, as is my right under the PRA.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\nDear Rose: \r\nWe have redone the query of graffiti nuisance notices from our customer service system to include dates of the notices. The data is available for you to download. \r\nAccording to the system administrators, the actual date on the letter, i.e. when it was printed, is not captured in the system per se, only the date the printing task is completed. The latter is the date that is documented on the redone sheet, which is likely very close to, if not the same,\u00a0date when the letter was mailed. \r\nI also asked the data administrators to include other data points that appeared on the letter, such as the description of the graffiti, which was not on the first sheet. \r\nThis completes and closes your request. If you have follow-up questions or would like to appeal this response, please contact me within 14 days. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of our response begins to run as of this date. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJ.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn November of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security amended the agency's Freedom of Information Act regulations under the guise of inter alia, \"streamlining the language of several procedural provisions\". See 81 Fed. Reg. 83625 (Nov. 22, 2016).  The new regulations impose requirements on requestors with respect to describing the records sought that are not found in the text of the Freedom of Information Act. They also allow ICE to administratively close FOIA requests where requestors fail to respond to the agency's assertion that the request is too broad. The regulations provide for no right of appeal of the administratively closure decision. \r\n\r\nFunctionally, these regulatory changes allow ICE to unilaterally assert that a request is too broad or not described with sufficient specificity to allow the agency to conduct a search for records, and then place the burden on the requestor to promptly respond or else have their request shunted into a bureaucratic limbo. In the event the administrative appeal is sustained and the request remanded back to ICE for processing, the agency's FOIA office essentially buys itself a second bite at the Act's timing requirements, with which it is already serially and egregiously non-compliant.\r\n\r\nThe experience of FOIA requestors post-November 2016 has been that the agency's updated regulations offered ICE's FOIA office a pretext to deny or administratively close request that the agency incorrectly and unlawfully characterizes as being \"too broad\".  When requestors have appealed the initial \"too broad\" determination, this determinations are almost uniformly reversed -- calling into question the process by which ICE FOIA makes the determination in the first place. Illustrative examples of this practice, with FOIA case numbers, are attached to this request. \r\n\r\nIn the context of a prior request for any ICE training materials or guidance for determining when a request is too broad, 2017-ICFO-29691, the agency simply directed the requestor to the text of the Freedom of Information Act and DHS's implementing regulations. \r\n\r\nDHS has not publicly disclosed the numbers of \"administratively closed\" requests in its annual reporting to DOJ and Congress. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of several media clients and non-profit organizations, I therefore request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any record showing the total number of initial \"too broad\" determination letters ICE FOIA sent to requestors during FY16-19. \r\n2. Any record showing the total number of responses by requestors within the 30-day timeframe set forth in ICE FOIA's \"too broad\" determination letters during FY16-19. \r\n3. Any record showing the total number of FOIA requests ICE administratively closed based on a requestor's failure to respond to the agency's \"too broad\" determinations during FY16-19. \r\n4. Any record showing the total number of administrative appeals  ICE FOIA received challenging the agency's \"too broad\" determinations during FY16-19. \r\n5. Any record showing the total number of remands of administrative appeals of ICE FOIA \"too broad\" determination during FY16-19. \r\n6. Any record showing the total number of FOIA lawsuits filed since November 22, 2016, challenging the agency's \"too broad\" determination, or its decision to administratively close a case for failure to respond to such a letter. \r\n7. Any training, guidance, checklist, template, or other document used by ICE FOIA to document the language in the FOIA request that falls short of the requirements set forth by DHS in 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b). \r\n8. Any communications, reports, dashboards, or modules demonstrating the total number of administratively closed FOIA requests currently pending before ICE based on a \"too broad\" determination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.

        "communication": "I hereby appeal the adequacy of the agency's search, and the legality of the agency's withholdings. \r\n\r\nFirst, ICE FOIA claims, incredibly, that it does not maintain records guiding FOIA officers on when a request is \"too broad\" under 6 CFR 5.3(b). This claim, if true, would establish a serious failure in the agency's training and supervision of its FOIA office, and is completely inconsistent with the agency's obligations under the Act. \r\n\r\nSecond, ICE FOIA contends that its 29-page response to Item 3 constitutes the only responsive record it has to this request. As an initial matter, ICE's failure to produce the records in native format (likely a .csv or .xls file) violates the Act. Substantively however, the agency's production of some 1100 requests it says the FOIA office closed as \"too broad\" under 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b) demonstrates why the agency's refusal to search for and produce records responsive to Items 1-2 and 4-8 cannot possibly be true. That's because the 29-page pdf does not contain the terms 'too broad\" or \"5.3(b)\", or any other term that would explain how these particular ~1100 records came to be designated as responsive to Item 3. Clearly, they were printouts from a system of records that ICE FOIA presumably queried. What was the basis for that query? How did that query produce these results? If ICE FOIA is to be believed that it doesn't track or maintain records responsive to Items 1-2 and 4-8, and that these 29 pages are the ONLY responsive documents that would be returned by a search reasonably calculated to lead to all responsive records, how can ICE FOIA explain the lack of any reference to the actual terms of Item 3 in the pdf if produced? \r\n\r\nPlease process this appeal within the period allowed by law and remand to the agency for re-tasking and re-processing consistent with the Act.",

You are seeking appealing the adequacy of the search and withholdings of records regarding several points concerning request deemed as \"too broad\" during FY 2016-2019. \n\nThese documents are on the ICE FOIA library  at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/manual-ICEFOIAIntakeSOP.pdf \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",
