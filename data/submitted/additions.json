        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nCourt documents show that the FBI has an at least 16-page report concerning the attempted bribery of former Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced by Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 and Puerto Rican Elected Official 2. The court document alleges \"Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 aimed to negotiate with V\u00e1zquez, recognizing that if Pierluisi\u2019sappointment failed, she would be positioned to become governor.\" The court document also alleges that \"V\u00e1zquez agreed to assist the FBI, starting by recording a conversation with , a Department of Justice contractor (\u201cContractor 1\u201d), who had been approached by , Puerto Rican Elected Official 1\u2019s cousin and a convicted felon, about arranging a meeting between V\u00e1zquez and Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 regarding the governorship.\" The document continues by saying that \"under the FBI's guidance, V\u00e1zquez recorded several conversations.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the document, the FBI closed the investigation in November 2019, citing difficulties in arranging meetings with V\u00e1zquez after she became governor. I have attached the document in its entirety to this communication.You can find the document here: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64868850/677/united-states-v-vazquez-garced/\r\n\r\nA news report revealed that Elected Official 1 and Elected Official 2 are former Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n.

Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, one of the people reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is currently Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner and is running for Governor of Puerto Rico under the New Progressive Party. Similarly, Thomas Rivera Schatz, another person reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is running for the Senate of Puerto Rico. The FBI report could have pertinent information relating to both of their campaigns, a highly relevant topic given the approaching November 5 election. Access to this information is crucial for informing the public about potential implications for governance and policy direction. \r\n\r\nAs a journalist, timely access to this information will enable me to report on critical issues affecting the electorate, ensuring that voters have the necessary context as they prepare to make informed decisions.
