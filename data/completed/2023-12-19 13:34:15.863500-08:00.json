If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Manuel de Dios Unanue (4 January 1943 \u2013 11\r\n    March 1992) who was a Cuban-born US journalist, radio show host, anti-drug\r\n    crusading editor of magazines Cambio XXI and Crimen, and editor-in-chief of\r\n    El Diario La Prensa, New York City's largest Spanish-language daily\r\n    newspaper.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

PRU responds as follows:\r\n\r\nRequest No. 1\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease provide the following information: Lists all technologies including the names of all products, manufacturers and model numbers for artificial intelligences, algorithms, databases, database locations, data analytic centers, softwares, facial recognition technologies, predictive policing programs, hot spot mapping systems, mobile applications, automated license plate readers, cameras; body worn or otherwise, audio and video recording equipment, stingrays, digital receiver technologies, reports, (including but not limited to police reports/citation numbers), financial documents, field interviews cards\r\nused in securing Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.354 citations/arrests for the time period 1/1/2022 through November 30, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\nResponse to Request No. 1\r\n\r\nAs discussed during our phone conversation on December 12, 2023, LVMPD does not track the technologies used to facilitate arrests. In order to determine if technologies, products, databases, etc. were used, each individual arrest report would have to be reviewed. Therefore, this portion of your request is burdensome.\r\n\r\nThe records you seek are not readily available and would be unduly burdensome to gather, compile, redact, and produce.\r\nA public entity need not produce records that are not readily available and would require research, compilation, and redaction to produce.  See Lunney v. State, 418 P.3d 943, 954 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2017) (recognizing that the agency was not required to respond to the burdensome request); Shehadeh v. Madigan, 996 N.E.2d 1243, 1249 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013) (holding that the Attorney General satisfied its burden by explaining that its staff members would have to go through all of the 9,200 potentially responsive documents by hand); Beckett v. Serpas, 112 So.3d 348, 353 (La. App. Ct. 2013) (determining that segregating 10-years\u2019 worth of files is unreasonably burdensome); Community Youth Athletic Ctr. v. City of Nat\u2019l City, 164 Cal.Rptr.3d 644, 676, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1425 (2013) (generally, an agency is not required to undertake extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, and in general, the scope of an agency\u2019s search for public records need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents) .\r\nTo determine if producing documents \u201cposes an unreasonable administrative burden,\u201d courts consider whether the general presumption in favor of disclosure is overcome by:  \u201c(1) the resources and time it will take to locate, compile, and redact the requested materials; (2) the volume of materials requested; and, (3) the extent to which compliance with the request will disrupt the agency's ability to perform its core functions.\u201d  Lunney, 418 P.3d at 954; cf.\r\n\r\nNAC 239.860 (defining \u201creadily available\u201d for purposes of State agencies as records that are \u201ceasily retrievable,\u201d \u201cnot confidential,\u201d and having a \u201cnature...such that an officer, employee or agent of the agency\u2026is not required to review the record to determine whether the record includes confidential information\u201d).\r\nPlease reformulate your request.  If you can narrow your focus to records that are readily available, LVMPD can proceed with researching your request.\r\n\r\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) does not maintain any particular record containing the information you are seeking. Moreover, LVMPD databases cannot \u201creadily compile the requested information.\u201d  See Public Employees Retirement System of Nevada v. Nevada Policy Research Inst., Inc., --- Nev. ---, 429 P.3d 280, 288 (2018), quoting Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t v. Blackjack Bonding, Inc., 131 Nev. 80, 87, 343 P.3d 608, 613 (2015).\r\nIn other words, your request requires LVMPD to do more than simply \u201c[s]earch[] an electronic database to produce existing records and data\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nPublic Employees Retirement System at 287, quoting ACLU of Arizona v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Child Safety, 377 P.3d 339, 346 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2016).  Rather, your request requires LVMPD to \u201ccompile information about the information [the database] contains.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nAs such, your request requires the creation of a new record, which LVMPD has no duty to do under the Nevada Public Records Act.  Public Employees Retirement System at 286.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest No. 2\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease provide all citation/arrest numbers for Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.354 and Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.353 (To include all Sub Sections) for the time of January 01, 2022 through November 30, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\nResponse to Request No. 2\r\n\r\nWe are actively corresponding with the appropriate unit(s) to determine what documents, if any, are responsive.\r\n\r\n Please be advised The Nevada Public Records Act permits public entities to \u201ccharge a fee for providing a copy of a public record\u201d as long as the fee does \u201cnot exceed the actual cost to the government entity to provide the copy of the public record.\u201d NRS 239.052(1). \u201cActual cost\u201d is defined broadly as \u201cthe direct cost related to the reproduction incurred by a governmental entity in the provision of a public records, including without limitation, the cost of ink, toner, paper, media and postage.\u201d NRS 239.005(1). The latter statute was amended in 2019 by the Nevada Legislature via Senate Bill 287. The legislative history indicates that public entities may charge for labor and personnel costs when compilation and redaction are required.\r\n\r\nWe will advise if there will be a fee after corresponding with the appropriate unit.\r\n You can expect to be updated on the progress of your request no later than 01/02/2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPublic Records Unit (PRU)\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Wayne State University was awarded the grant on September 15, 2022 through the Department of Defense's Defense Health Program, and is collaborating with researchers at the University of Michigan on the project.

        "communication": "CDR U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command\r\nAttn: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office\r\n810 Schreider Street\r\nFort Detrick, MD 21702-5000\r\n\r\nAugust 23, 2023\r\n\r\nGreetings:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following decision for FOIA case number FA-23-0032/FP-23-0018994:\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2023, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was filed via MuckRock with the U.S. Army Medical Department asking for copies of records germane to award ID W81XWH2211105.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 2023, Glenn W. Field, Records Manager, U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, responded by stating this request had been forwarded to the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USMRAA). A subsequent communication from Nicole Schwab, Freedom of Information Act Specialist, USMRAA, also dated June 6, 2023, confirmed receipt of the request and stated it had been assigned a FOIA control number of 23-00415.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2023, Nicole Schwab, Freedom of Information Act Specialist, USMRAA, released a copy of a program announcement for the Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health Research Program, and on June 23, 2023, released a copy of a grant voucher for the program.\r\n\r\nFinally, on June 12, 2023, Robyn Mack, Communications Director, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), responded to a partial referral to the USAMRDC, now assigned a FOIA case number FA-23-0032/FP-23-0018994, notifying me that it had been rejected because the reviewing agency could find no records.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nIn my original FOIA request, I referenced a Politico article dated September 15, 2022, titled \"The Pentagon is funding experiments on animals to recreate \u2018Havana Syndrome\u2019\". You will find a copy of this article attached but for clarity's sake, a link can be found here: https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/09/pentagon-funding-experiments-animals-havana-syndrome-00086393\r\n\r\nThe Politico article identifies award ID W81XWH2211105 as being connected to Department of Defense-funded research that will use live animal subjects in testing and experimentation. The relevant sections of the article state: \r\n\r\n\"The Army in September awarded Wayne State University in Michigan a $750,000 grant to study the effects of radio frequency waves on ferrets, which have brains similar to humans, according to information on the grant posted on USASpending.gov.\r\n\r\n\"During the Wayne University study, researchers planned to expose the 48 ferrets to radio frequency waves for two hours a day for 60 days. This is expected to result in 'an exposure profile that is likely comparable to that which our embassy personnel received.' Twenty-four additional ferrets will receive 'sham exposure,' according to the summary.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use an animal like a ferret that has brain structures resembling the 'gyrencephalic nature' of the human brain; mice and rats do not fulfill this criteria, according to the summary. The brain tissue of gyrencephalic animals, like humans, ferrets, pigs and primates, resembles ridges and valleys, compared to smooth surfaces of the brains of lissencephalic animals, such as mice and rats.\"\r\n\r\nGiven that these highlighted sections reference tests using live animals, I believe the USAMRDC did not conduct a complete search of records. Had it done so it should have also found, at a minimum, a proposal created by Wayne State researchers and sent to the USAMRDC\u2019s Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO), an ACURO-formatted appendix, an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) approved protocol, and, potentially, adverse event reports.\r\n\r\nPer the USAMRDC ACURO website, these documents are required for all research funded by the Department of Defense. For instance, a section of the website covering protocol submission instructions (https://mrdc.health.mil/index.cfm/collaborate/research_protections/acuro/protocol_submission) states: \r\n\r\n\u201cInstitutions using United States Department of Defense (DoD) funds to support the use of animals in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) or training must adhere to DoD requirements for administrative review and approval by the Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO). Below is guidance on protocol and amendment submission.\u201d\r\n\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the June 12, 2023 decision by Ms. Mack and, at a minimum, requesting copies of the following records:\r\n\r\n- ACURO proposal;\r\n\r\n- ACURO appendix;\r\n\r\n- IACUC approved protocol;\r\n\r\n- Adverse Event Reports.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am also asking the USAMRDC to conduct an additional search for other records germane to award ID W81XWH2211105. It is likely that if the USAMRDC missed these records, it may have also missed others.\r\n\r\nI am also renewing my request for a fee waiver. The waiver would help to further public understanding of government-funded research currently underway on the subject of anomalous health incidents, aka Havana Syndrome. This subject has appeared in numerous articles since 2017 such as the one published by Politico on September 15, 2022, making it both a subject of public interest and one that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the USMRAA and USAMRDC do in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Mr. Skvarla,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have received your appeal to a FOIA request with tracking number\r\nFA-23-0032. We received it on 6 October 2023, and it was post marked 5\r\nSeptember 2023.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour original request was for the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID W81XWH2211105, granted to Wayne State\r\nUniversity for a\r\n\r\n\"TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH RESEARCH\r\n\r\nPROGRAM\", first referenced in a story published by Politico on March 9,\r\n2023, titled \"The\r\n\r\nPentagon is funding experiments on animals to recreate 'Havana Syndrome'\".\r\nWayne State\r\n\r\nUniversity was awarded the grant on September 15, 2022 through the\r\nDepartment of Defense's\r\n\r\nDefense Health Program, and is collaborating with researchers at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan\r\n\r\non the project. This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Grant Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Wayne State University and the Department of Defense\r\nconnected to this\r\n\r\nGrant\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request came to us by way of a referral from MEDCoe to USAMRAA to my\r\noffice at USAMRDC. Only a portion of the request was sent to our office for\r\ndirect response to you as the requester. That portion was specifically in\r\nreference to \"Presentations by Wayne State University and the Department of\r\nDefense connected to this Grant.\" (see Partial Referral Memo From USAMRAA -\r\nattached)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur response of \"No Records\" was solely to that portion of the request. This\r\nwas outlined in our response letter dated 12 June 2023 and sent to you on 27\r\nJune 2023. USAMRAA maintained the remainder of the request since they have\r\npurview of records for awards. We were only responsible to respond to the\r\nportion related to \"Presentations by Wayne State University and the\r\nDepartment of Defense connected to this Grant\". (see FA-23-0032 (Skvarla)\r\nResponse No Records - attached)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, your original request was for \"copies of records for award ID\r\nW81XWH2211105\". Your appeal is requesting additional records (i.e. ACURO and\r\nIACUC records) that would not be considered records of a contract award and\r\nwould therefore not be considered within the scope of your original request.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConsidering the above information, we have made the following\r\ndeterminations:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.\tYour appeal does not refer to any adverse determinations provided by\r\nour response letter referencing the portion of the request that we were\r\nresponsible to reply to.\r\n\r\n*\tIt does not appear you have appealed our decision making your appeal\r\nunactionable from our office.\r\n\r\n2.\tYou will need to submit a new FOIA request for any additional\r\nrecords from USAMRDC. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere may be a misunderstanding of the terminology used and how it is\r\ninterpreted within your description of records. If you would like to give me\r\na call at the number in my signature block, I'd be more than happy to assist\r\nin getting a request together for exactly what you are seeking. Also, I do\r\nnot believe you have received a final response from USAMRAA on the remainder\r\nof your request. They could possibly have more records.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you,\r\n\r\nCarl\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCarl Larcom\r\n\r\nFOIA/Privacy Officer\r\n\r\nU.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command\r\n\r\n810 Schreider St.\r\n\r\nSuite 206\r\n\r\nFort Detrick, MD  21702\r\n\r\n301-619-6852\r\n\r\n <mailto:usarmy.detrick.medcom-usamrmc.mbx.foia@health.mil>\r\nusarmy.detrick.medcom-usamrmc.mbx.foia@health.mil",

Official Code \u00a7 2-532 (2001) (\u201cDC FOIA\u201d), DCHA must make a reasonable effort to locate already existing records. FOIA does not require DCHA to conduct research for requesters, answer written questions, or in any other way create records (such as lists or statistics) to respond to a request. As such, DCHA can only provide requesters with existing documents or records maintained by the agency.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with DC FOIA, DCHA thoroughly searched the applicable agency records and found responsive documents, which are located here: Production<https://dchousing.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ogcTeam/EuJHrjdYrBhPgS6a3pGgrHAB72Kv-Y_x7gTGsyRJ9V9Jlw?email=154470-01554957%40requests.muckrock.com&e=76DMg5>\r\n\r\nRegarding any redaction of personal information or withholding of documents, such information or documents may be withheld pursuant to DC Code \u00a72-534(a)(2) to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your request, you are advised that under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you have the right to appeal to the Mayor or the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, the appeal must be in writing. The appeal letter should cite the \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line. If you mail the appeal, this should also be on the outside of the envelope. The appeal must include the following:\r\n\r\n1.            Copy of the original request.\r\n\r\n2.            Copy of your appeal letter.\r\n\r\n3.            Statement of appeal that includes the circumstances, reasons, or arguments advanced in support of disclosure.\r\n\r\n4.            Daytime telephone number, an e-mail address, or a USPS mailing address.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to:\r\n\r\nMayor\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\n1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\r\nSuite 407\r\nWashington, D.C. 20004\r\n\r\nIn lieu of mailing the appeal via USPS, an electronic version of the appeal can be e-mailed to the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel instead at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>. The electronic version must still meet all of the requirements for an appeal.\r\n\r\nA copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to DCHA\u2019s attention at foia@dchousing.org<mailto:foia@dchousing.org>.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact DCHA if you have any additional questions.\r\n\r\nEric D.

The arrest has been widely reported, including an article by WAFF 48 on May 31, 2023 (URL: https://www.waff.com/2023/05/31/huntsville-police-officer-arrested-dui-over-holiday-weekend/?outputType=amp).\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that a 2018 Attorney General's opinion in Alabama suggests that out-of-state residents do not have the same access to public records as in-state residents, I assert that as a journalist working on a matter of clear public interest, this request should be considered. Further, federal case law including Lee v. Minner has upheld the principle that there should be no geographic discrimination in the application of public records law.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: 1-845-748-0329\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Jordan Lassiter.",

        "communication": "Subject: Appeal of Public Records Request Denial - Request #23-84\r\n\r\n\r\nCity of Opelika, AL\r\nAttn: FOIA Officer\r\nOpelika Police Department\r\n501 S 10th St\r\nOpelika, AL 36801\r\n\r\nRe: Appeal of Public Records Request Denial - Request #23-84\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to appeal the denial of my public records request, #23-84, dated November 21, 2023. The closure reason provided stated that my request was denied because it indicates that I reside out-of-state, and the Alabama Public Records Act is available only to Alabama citizens.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the City's dedication to following relevant statutes, and I would like to address the concerns raised in the denial. According to the denial letter, the denial is based on \u00a736-12-40, Code of Alabama, which provides citizens of Alabama the right to view public records with some exceptions. The letter also references McBurney v. Young, 133 S. Ct. 1709 (2013) and an opinion to Honorable Howard J. Verner, Coffee County Constable, A.G. No 2018-030.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would like to emphasize that case law, such as McBurney v. Young, primarily addresses the issue of access to public records by out-of-state residents. However, recent federal case law, including Lee v. Minner, has upheld the principle that there should be no geographic discrimination in the application of public records law. It is crucial to consider this broader perspective, especially when the request is made by an investigative journalist working on a matter of clear public interest.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I assert that the denial incorrectly relies on an opinion, stating that \"opinion is not law.\" Opinions do not have the same legal weight as statutes or case law. The denial should be based on the applicable legal framework and established precedents rather than an opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a journalist working on behalf of public interest and transparency, I kindly request a reevaluation of my request. I am willing to provide documentation as to my Alabama residency, as suggested, by providing a copy of my current driver's license or other suitable documentation.\r\n\r\nI believe that the information requested is of significant public interest, especially considering the arrest of Huntsville Police Department Officer D'Marius Howard for DUI. This incident has garnered public attention and media coverage, as evidenced by the article from WAFF 48 on May 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that the City reconsider the denial of my public records request, taking into account the broader legal landscape and the public interest involved. If there are any concerns or additional information required, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased). Meanwhile the public interest in such the historical study of OCDETF cases has been established by reviews of the Management Information System by the National Archives.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I ran a preliminary search of ALJ Westby's mailbox with your criteria and the search has resulted in 10,808 emails. These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

I find no such demand, but I did receive, on the following day, January 21, 2022, from your office a demand for payment.  Assuming that this is the fee to which you intended to refer, your claim that I failed to pay the fee is false.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that I received your January 21 demand for payment, I mailed a check, number 10292, for $1.25, with memo indicating that the payment pertained to request P084799-121921, payable to Seattle Police Department Washington Public Records Act Office, addressed to PO Box 34986, Seattle, WA 98124-4986.  That check cleared on February 7, 2022, well within 30 days of the demand for payment.\r\n\r\nYou did not send the record I requested, or any record.  I received no further communications from your office regarding this request until you responded to my recent request for status update with the aforementioned notice of your intent not to provide the record.\r\n\r\nPlease send the record as required by law.  You have had almost two years to locate and deliver this record.  This was not a complicated request.  I mailed payment for your silly fee the same day you demanded it, and two weeks later, you cashed my check, thereby accepting my payment.\r\n\r\nCordially,\r\nPhil Mocek",

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev.

Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to Clayland Boyden Gray. Mr. Gray was a lawyer and diplomat who served as White House Counsel from 1989 to 1993 and as U.S. Ambassador to the European Union from 2006 to 2007. He was born on 6 February 1943 in Winston-Salem, NC, USA. He died on 21 May 2023.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in numerous national media, including the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/obituaries/c-boyden-gray-dead.html and the Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/05/21/c-boyden-gray-white-house-counsel-president-ghw-bush-dies-80/.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) President George Herbert Walker Bush, to whom the subject served as White House Counsel\r\n(2) Chief Justice Earl Warren, to whom the subject was a law clerk\r\n(3) The Atlantic Counsel, on whose board the subject served\r\n(4) The European Institute, on whose board the subject served\r\n(5) FreedomWorks, on whose board the subject served\r\n(6) The Federalist Society, of which the subject was a member\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray was a public figure. He served as White House Counsel to George H. W. Bush and was the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. News obituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other national media. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Given Mr. Gray's government service as a high-level advisor and employee in the executive and judicial branches, the public's understanding of Mr. Gray, his work, and the work of the government will likely be enhanced significantly.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just an inquisitive citizen. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this request.",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n    \r\n    Public Interest Factors:\r\n    \r\n    1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or\r\n    activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor\r\n    because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n    \r\n    2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the\r\n    subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray\r\n    has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that\r\n    were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n    \r\n    3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning\r\n    a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u00e2\u20ac\u201das opposed\r\n    to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this\r\n    factor because Mr. Gray was a public figure. He served as White House\r\n    Counsel to George H. W. Bush and was the U.S. Ambassador to the European\r\n    Union. News obituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in the New York Times, the\r\n    Washington Post, and other national media. Thus, a broad audience of persons\r\n    will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any\r\n    records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism\r\n    site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and\r\n    encourages journalism around them.\r\n    \r\n    4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a\r\n    significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray\r\n    has recently died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records\r\n    that it could not have released until now. Given Mr. Gray's government\r\n    service as a high-level advisor and employee in the executive and judicial\r\n    branches, the public's understanding of Mr. Gray, his work, and the work of\r\n    the government will likely be enhanced significantly.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

        "communication": "Dear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver for my FOIPA Request No. 1593177-000 .\r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2. My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of his death appearing in major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political scientists, scholars, the legal academy, and many others. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.\r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
