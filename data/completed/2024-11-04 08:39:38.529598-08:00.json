The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Surface Transportation Board's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your agency has also been subject to litigation for failures to administer proper procedures that have resulted in deaths from a mass shooting (Parkland, FL).  I feel the information as presented shows an overwhelming government interest in the agency maintaining public trust adhering to transparency and guiding its own public image or lack thereof. \r\n\r\nAgain, you are petitioned to waive the fees in the public interest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. Any and all documents relating to or filed in connection with school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request such documents produced to include, but not limited to, the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such a production of the documents in question 1 is not possible, please provide any reports, incident notes, status updates, or documents which were submitted to DESE as the result of a school based arrest or any such referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement or arrest, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRylee Meints\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

You requested \"To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. Any and all documents relating to or filed in connection with school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request such documents produced to include, but not limited to, the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such a production of the documents in question 1 is not possible, please provide any reports, incident notes, status updates, or documents which were submitted to DESE as the result of a school based arrest or any such referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement or arrest, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

Please log in to the Public Records Center using the following link to retrieve the responsive documents:\u00a0City of Springfield Public Records Portal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that redactions have been made pursuant to M.G.L. ch. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c) (also known as \u201cExemption (c)\u2019 \u2013 \u2018The Privacy Exemption\u201d), M.G.L. ch. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a) (also known as \u201cExemption (a)\u2019 \u2013 \u2018The Statutory Exemption\u201d) under M.G.L. ch. 41, \u00a7 97D and M.G.L. ch. 119, \u00a7 60A.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExemption (c) allows for the withholding of personnel files, medical files, and other information and materials whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; except records related to a law enforcement misconduct investigation. See M.G. L. ch. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c). All information that could identify a victim or minor and sensitive data related to specifically named individuals have been redacted for privacy including names, residential addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, court docket numbers, and warrant numbers. Furthermore, all records of domestic violence and/or abuse of a household or family member have been redacted in their entirety.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExemption (a) prohibits the release of materials that are \u201cspecifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d The applicable statute that the City is required to withhold certain records under exemption (a) is M.G.L. ch. 41, \u00a7 97D which states that \"all reports of rape and sexual assault or attempts to commit such offenses, all reports of abuse perpetrated by family or household members, as defined in section 1 of chapter 209A, and all communications between police officers and victims of such offenses or abuse shall not be public reports.\" All reports involving domestic violence, or abuse of a household or family member have been redacted. Therefore all information related to arrests that occurred for domestic violence or abuse of a household or family member has been redacted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurthermore, M.G.L. ch. 119, \u00a7 60A states that \u201cdelinquency records shall be withheld from public inspection except with the consent of a justice of such court; provided, however, that such records shall be open, at all reasonable times, to inspection by the child proceeded against, his parents, guardian or attorney; provided further, that nothing herein shall be construed to provide access to privileged or confidential communications and information; and provided further, that said protections shall be construed to include information and communications entered at the indictment.\u201d Therefore, all information that identifies a juvenile has been redacted including names, residential addresses, docket numbers, and warrant numbers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease note that M.G.L. ch. 119, \u00a7 60A allows for the juvenile, the juvenile's guardian, and the juvenile's attorney to access redacted records. These individuals can request their records from the Police Department Clerk\u2019s Office in person with a copy of their government-issued photo identification and proof of representation (if applicable) at Springfield Police Department's Clerk's Office, located at 130 Pearl Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you be aggrieved by this response, you may appeal to the Supervisor of Public Records in the Massachusetts Secretary of State\u2019s Office pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.00 and M.G.L. ch. 66, \u00a7 10(b). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease contact the Public Records Division by responding to this email or by phone at (413) 787-6085 with any questions.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

However, if a custodian believes it will take more than 10 business days to respond to the request, the custodian must notify the requestor in writing or by email within that time period of the following: the amount of time it will take to produce the public record, an estimate of fees (if applicable) and the reason for the delay. Additionally, please note that under Section 4-206 of the PIA, a custodian may charge a fee for the search for, preparation of, and reproduction of a public record; this fee prorated for each individual's salary and actual time attributable to the search for and preparation of a public record. In addition, per Howard County Council Resolution No. 68-2022, the County charges a copying fee of $0.25 per page for a black and white paper copy. If electronic copies of the responsive records exist, they are free of charge; however, when an electronic response, or portion thereof, is too large to send electronically, the response, or portion thereof, will be provided either in paper format, or electronically on a CD, DVD or flash drive, as the requester specifies. The cost of a CD, DVD or flash drive is the actual cost of the CD, DVD, or flash drive. \nFor more information on the PIA, please visit Maryland\u2019s Office of the Attorney General website at http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/OpenGov/pia.aspx.

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

I request COPIES of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your agency procedures for the processing of public records requests.\r\n\r\n2. I request COPIES of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your publicly posted agency policy regarding the processing of public records requests.\r\n\r\n3. I request COPIES of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your agency policy, procedures, best practices, and guidelines regarding communications between your agency and public records requestors \u2013 specifically any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding the use of email in communication for the receipt and production of public records, as well as the use of email in communications regarding clarification of public records requests by your agency.\r\n\r\n4. I request COPIS of any and all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding your agency policy, procedures, best practices, and guidelines regarding your agency's use of any 3rd party \"portal\" or online data products in the processing of public records requests including but not limited to the use of GOVQA, Next-Request, Just FOIA, or any other online data product.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE - DO NOT DELAY PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY OF REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS IN BAD FAITH\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 (8) An agency can only seek a clarification when the request is objectively \"unclear.\" Seeking a \"clarification\" of an objectively clear request delays access to public records.\r\n\r\nDo not delay production of copies of records responsive to this public records request by sending emails seeking redundant \"confirmation\" the requestor still wants the records originally requested. This request should remain open and production of copies of responsive public records requested should continue until complete.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever.

The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989).

The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE - DO NOT DELAY PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY OF REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS IN BAD FAITH\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 (8) An agency can only seek a clarification when the request is objectively \"unclear.\" Seeking a \"clarification\" of an objectively clear request delays access to public records.\r\n\r\nDo not delay production of copies of records responsive to this public records request by sending emails seeking redundant \"confirmation\" the requestor still wants the records originally requested. This request should remain open and production of copies of responsive public records requested should continue until complete. The requestor WANTS COPIES OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTED.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\n**Please see the attachment for additional information**\r\n\r\n**REGULAR EMAIL RESPONSE \u2013 DO NOT CORRESPOND VIA GOVQA MESSAGING**\r\n\r\nPreferred Method to Receive Records:\r\nRegular Mail\u201d\r\n\r\nThe City interprets your request as seeking policies and procedures related to the City's current practices for receipt of and response to Public Records Requests. Please see the City's Public Disclosure Website, reachable by the following links.\r\n\r\nhttps://tacoma.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(pi4wl0cafgqiaruqcf5up1cm))/supporthome.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request is closed as of the date of this letter. The City does not intend to further address your request and the one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review begins to run as of the date of this letter.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to assist you.  Please contact me within 30 days of this letter 11/30/24, if you have any questions.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nBrandie Marshall\r\nPublic Disclosure Analyst\r\nPublic Records Office\r\n(253) 231-0236",

Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

I am an independent investigative journalist, and I am conducting research on the issue of FBI agent misconduct and accountability.\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me with copies of the following records or records containing the following information:\r\n\r\nAny records pertaining to the suspension, termination, or disciplinary action of Special Agent Richard J. Trask, who was directly involved in the investigation and prosecution of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as reported by The Detroit News and other media outlets (see links below).\r\nAny records indicating the reasons, grounds, or evidence for the suspension, termination, or disciplinary action of Special Agent Richard J. Trask, including but not limited to his arrest and plea deal on charges of domestic violence, his social media posts criticizing former President Donald Trump, and his moonlighting as a personal trainer.\r\nAny records showing the impact, consequences, or implications of the suspension, termination, or disciplinary action of Special Agent Richard J. Trask on the investigation and prosecution of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, including but not limited to the decision not to use him as a witness during the trial, the credibility and reliability of his testimony and evidence, and the defense strategy of claiming FBI informant entrapment.\r\nAny records demonstrating the policies and procedures for preventing and responding to FBI agent misconduct and ensuring FBI agent accountability, and the implementation and evaluation of such policies and procedures.\r\nI request that the records be provided in electronic format, preferably as PDF files, and sent to my email address. If the records cannot be provided in electronic format, I request that they be mailed to my address.\r\n\r\nI request that you waive all fees associated with this request. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. The information I seek is of vital public interest and concern, as it relates to the integrity and professionalism of the FBI agents and the justice and fairness of the criminal cases they handle. The information I seek will reveal the extent and nature of the FBI agent misconduct and accountability problem, and the actions taken by the FBI to address it. The information I seek will also enhance the accountability and transparency of the FBI, and inform the public debate and policy making on this critical issue.\r\n\r\nIf you deny my request for a fee waiver, please notify me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I prefer to communicate with you by email or phone, rather than by mail, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this request.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records as soon as possible, and in any case not later than 20 business days after the date of this request. If you decide to deny the request, you are required to respond in writing and state the statutory exception authorizing the withholding of all or part of the public record and the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation on this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChristina Urso\r\n Independent Journalist\r\n\r\nhttps://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/09/11/fbi-fires-whitmer-kidnap-case-agent-amid-wife-beating-allegations/8295557002/\r\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/documents-reveal-more-about-gruesome-abuse-allegations-against-lead-fbi-agent-on-gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-case/\r\nhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2021/07/22/fbi-agent-at-center-of-michigan-gov-whitmer-kidnap-probe-assaulted-wife-after-swingers-party-authorities-say/\r\nhttps://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/12/20/ex-fbi-agent-whitmer-kidnap-plot-enters-plea-case-tied-wifes-assault/8969608002/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "January 16, 2024\r\n\r\nVIA FOIA ONLINE\r\n\r\nDirector, Office of Information Policy (OIP)\r\nUnited States Department of Justice\r\n441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor\r\nWashington, D.C. 20530\r\n\r\nRe:  Freedom of Information Act Appeal (Req. 1610641-000)\r\n\r\nDear Freedom of Information Officer:\r\n\r\nOn November 8, 2023, I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any records pertaining to the suspension, termination, or disciplinary action of Special Agent Richard J. Trask, who was directly involved in the investigation and prosecution of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as reported by The Detroit News and other media outlets.\r\n\r\n2. Any records indicating the reasons, grounds, or evidence for the suspension, termination, or disciplinary action of Special Agent Richard J. Trask, including but not limited to his arrest and plea deal on charges of domestic violence, his social media posts criticizing former President Donald Trump, and his moonlighting as a personal trainer.\r\n\r\n3. Any records showing the impact, consequences, or implications of the suspension, termination, or disciplinary action of Special Agent Richard J. Trask on the investigation and prosecution of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, including but not limited to the decision not to use him as a witness during the trial, the credibility and reliability of his testimony and evidence, and the defense strategy of claiming FBI informant entrapment.\r\n\r\n4.  Any records demonstrating the policies and procedures for preventing and responding to FBI agent misconduct and ensuring FBI agent accountability, and the implementation and evaluation of such policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 2024, I received a letter postmarked November 16, 2023, from Section Chief Seidel acknowledging receipt of the request and providing FOI/PA Number 1610641-000. That same letter rejects the request saying \u201cYou have requested records on one or more third-party individuals. Please be advised the FBI will neither confirm nor deny the existence of such records pursuant to FOIA exemptions b(6) and b(7)(c), 5 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 552 b(6) and b(7)(c).\u201d This letter constitutes a timely appeal of that adverse determination.\r\n\r\nThe request seeks only records regarding Special Agent Trask\u2019s suspension, termination, and any disciplinary action that was taken. The implications of Special Agent Richard Trask\u2019s arrest and plea deal on charges of domestic violence during his time working on the high-profile Governor Gretchen Whitmer kidnap plot are grave, especially considering how Mr. Trask was the only person involved in the case \u2013 defendants included \u2013 who committed violence on another person. Five of the defendants in this case were acquitted by two different juries based on very serious allegations of entrapment and FBI misconduct. The disclosure of information might reveal how the agency needs to make improvements in dealing with agents who engage in misconduct.\r\n\r\nThe agency\u2019s refusal to confirm or deny the existence of records is similarly unwarranted. Such a response may be appropriate only when the existence of responsive records has not been officially disclosed by the responding agency. Specifically, \u201cIn the context of a Glomar response, the public domain exception is triggered when \u2018the prior disclosure establishes the existence (or not) of records responsive to the FOIA request,\u2019 regardless of whether the contents of the records have been disclosed.\u201d Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 710 F.3d 422, 427 (D.C. Cir. 2013) If \u201cthe agency has \u2018officially acknowledged\u2019 that it possesses records responsive to the FOIA request, \u2018the agency can no longer use a Glomar response\u2019 and therefore must either (1) disclose the record to the requester or (2) establish that its contents are exempt from disclosure and that such exemption has not been waived.\" James Madison Project v. Dep't of Justice, 302 F. Supp. 3d 12, 20 (D.D.C. 2018) \r\n\r\nAs you are likely aware, Mr. Trask was terminated from the FBI in September of 2021. Prosecutors in the Gov. Whitmer case (USA vs Fox, et al) revealed they decided not to use Trask as a witness during the trial, with the decision being announced after the revelation of social media posts in which Agent Trask referred to former President Donald Trump as \u201cdouchebag,\u201d and a \u201cpiece of s---,\u201d according to a December 2021 Detroit News article (detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/12/20/ex-fbi-agent-whitmer-kidnap-plot-enters-plea-case-tied-wifes-assault/8969608002/). In a September 11, 2021, interview with CBS affiliate News Channel 3, FBI Special Agent Joseph Lupinacci of the Detroit Field Office acknowledged the arrest and suspension of Special Agent Richard J. Trask saying, \u201cThe incident was subject to internal review,\u201d and \u201cUntil the review was finished, steps had been taken to ensure Trask no longer worked on FBI matters.\u201d He said the FBI couldn't provide more information until after the review was complete see (https://wwmt.com/news/local/agent-charged-with-assaulting-woman-no-longer-works-on-fbi-matters). Because the agency has publicly acknowledged the existence of records of the individuals named in the request, its \u201cGlomar\u201d response is not justified.\r\n\r\nThe privacy exemptions cited by the agency in its response are also inapplicable to the request. Per the Department of Justice\u2019s FOIA guide, \u201can individual generally does not have any expectation of privacy with respect to information that he or she has made public.\u201d \r\n\r\nBecause several individuals involved have publicly acknowledged the internal investigation, the social media posts he made had a decision in prosecutors not choosing to call him as a witness at trial, as a civil servant of a federal law enforcement agency tasked with protecting members of the public, the privacy exemptions no longer apply.\r\n\r\nFinally, before invoking the privacy exemptions cited, an agency is required to conduct a balancing test to \u201cweigh the privacy interest . . . in nondisclosure . . . against the only relevant public interest in the FOIA balancing analysis \u2013 the extent to which disclosure of the information sought would 'she[d] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties' or otherwise let citizens 'know what their government is up to.\u201d In this instance, the records sought clearly relate to the FBI\u2019s performance of its duties, and the degree of public interest in the issue of the agency\u2019s alleged entrapment and gross misconduct in the case, the five men accused being acquitted by two separate juries, the public interest would be difficult to overstate.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I respectfully appeal the agency\u2019s adverse determination of this request and ask that any segregable, non-exempt portions of any responsive records be produced as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration. If you have any questions or are in need of any additional information, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me at christina@radixverum.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nChristina L. Urso",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request # 1362506-000 for FBI records concerning Rafael Villaverde.  The FBI has located approximately 3,263 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nMs. Wilson\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-4894",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to Omar Abdel Rahman. Per the statute, proof of death is not required as his death has been widely and extensively reported by the media, including the New York Times on February 18, 2017. For your convenience, a copy of the obituary may be found at: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/middleeast/omar-abdel-rahman-dead.html?_r=0. Again, note that proof of death is not required.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nThe FBI has received your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request and it will be forwarded to Initial Processing for review.   Your request will be processed under the provisions of FOIPA and a response will be mailed to you at a later date.\r\n\r\nRequests for fee waivers and expedited processing will be addressed once your request has been assigned an FOIPA request number. You will receive written notification of the FBI\u2019s decision.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised, beginning Wednesday, March 1, 2017, you will no longer be able to submit FOIPA requests via email.  On this date, FOIPARequest@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:FOIPARequest@ic.fbi.gov> will permanently be taken offline and requests will need to be submitted using the FBI\u2019s electronic FOIPA portal at https://efoia.fbi.gov, after development and testing for two years. With this full implementation, eFOIPA will provide the FBI with an automated process for the receipt and opening of requests, replacing the current manual process and substantially reducing the time it takes to receive and open each electronic request received.  Given the FBI's high volume of requests, this will significantly increase efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms of service for the site will be modified to allow the uploading of attachments, to remove the limitation on the number of requests received each day by the application, to remove limitation on the number of requests which may be submitted by an individual per day, and increase availability to seven days a week-24 hours a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eFOIPA system will allow requests of all types \u2013 e.g.; Privacy Act, deceased individuals, policies/procedures, events, organizations, etc.  Requesters will:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022    Receive digital confirmation directly on their email account.\r\n\r\n\u2022    No longer have to wait for responses to be received using standard mail.\r\n\r\n\u2022    View transmitted responses and releases from the convenience of their smart phone or tablet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s eFOIPA portal was designed and developed to be the FBI\u2019s primary means for receiving FOIA and Privacy Act requests.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions about preparing or submitting your request using this new service, you may email foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov> or contact the Public Information Officer directly at 540-868-4593.  Alternatively, you may submit your request using fax or standard mail.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding the FOIPA is available at http://www.fbi.gov<http://www.fbi.gov>/ or http://www.fbi.gov/foia/<http://www.fbi.goiv/foia/>.  If you require additional assistance please contact the Public Information Officer.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nLeanna Ramsey\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nPLEASE REPLY DIRECTLY TO FOIPAREQUEST@IC.FBI.GOV\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Additionally, the Agency's response to your request does not include documents or publications publicly available on our website or compilations of publicly available news articles.\r\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Amber Smith at (202) 694-1437, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.

        "communication": "Dera Ms. Feldman:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your October 24 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) request for records related to package theft trends across major U.S. metropolitan areas. Specially, your requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Statistics on reported package thefts from Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Denver and Portland between January 1, 2019, and the present.\r\n  2.  Policies and protocols for investigating package theft involving USPS deliveries.\r\n  3.  Communication or agreements between the USPS Postal Inspection Service and local police departments regarding theft investigations and prevention.\r\n  4.  Public outreach materials or initiatives addressing package theft prevention.\r\n\r\nThe OIG FOIA case number shown in the subject line above has been assigned to your request. Your request will be processed in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides agencies 20 working days from receipt to respond to requesters. While this office routinely meets this requirement, current workloads may require additional time to provide our final response.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA is about records we have in our possession. The FOIA provides only for disclosing federal agency records and does not require government agencies to answer questions, conduct unreasonably burdensome research, or create records. FOIA does not let you appeal any investigative decisions or ask us to research aside from searching for responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The FOIA provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, unless such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgment is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and employment/personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the law enforcement, crime prevention, and security arm of USPS, and is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Additional information regarding the USPIS FOIA program can be found at Terms of Service and Legal | USPIS<https://www.uspis.gov/terms-of-service#freedom-of-information-act>.\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG\u2019s mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \u201coversight authority\u201d for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control. Likewise, the OIG Deputy General Counsel has no authority to review FOIA determinations issued by the Postal Service or USPIS.\r\n\r\nBecause records related to external mail theft are maintained by the USPIS, we are forwarding a copy of your request to their FOIA office. They will issue a separate FOIA case number and respond to you directly. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them via email at foia@uspis.gov<mailto:foia@uspis.gov>, or in writing at:\r\n\nOffice of Counsel\r\nU.S. Postal Inspection Service FOIA/PA Unit\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Room 3301\r\nWashington, DC  20260\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAny and all documents relating to or filed in connection with school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request such documents produced to include, but not limited to, the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such a production of the documents in question 1 is not possible, please provide any reports, incident notes, status updates, or documents which were submitted to DESE as the result of a school based arrest or any such referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement or arrest, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHeather Atherton\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHeather Atherton",
