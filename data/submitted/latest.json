Farr, Lopez Arrigo, Frederic William Aykens, James Darnell, James Gary, James Gay, Robert Gordan, Walter Lee-Lyte Parman, Robert Rodriguez, and Edgar K. Sanders.\r\n\r\nWalter Lee Parman was involved in various criminal activities, was on the FBI's Most Wanted List, and was convicted for the murder of Shirley Ann Cary in 1965. He also escaped from prison and was recaptured in 1984 under the alias Mike Noble. I am particularly interested in any recorded testimony given under the influence of sodium pentathol during his trial.\r\n\r\nPlease include all relevant files, correspondence, arrest records, and any other materials related to these matters. If some portions of these documents are exempt from release, please provide me with the non-exempt portions.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying the records, please inform me of the cost before processing my request. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the case.\r\n\r\nIf my request is denied in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the act. I expect the release of all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal any decision to withhold information or deny a waiver of fees.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally lodge a complaint against the actions of individuals involved in the watchlist operation, which I believe have resulted in the commission of unlawful acts. It has come to my attention that certain individuals associated with the watchlist operation are engaging in tactics such as man-in-the-middle cyber attacks to obstruct, manipulate, and misrepresent communications, particularly when submitting online reports to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, Attorneys, and other Government entities. For the sake of transparency and accountability, I am submitting this complaint through Muck Rock to ensure that the public is informed of my concerns and to facilitate the proper filing and tracking of this complaint.\r\n\r\nMy involvement in this matter stems from being unjustly placed on a watchlist subsequent to my disclosure of misconduct within the Radiology Department at Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur, Missouri. I strongly believe that I obtain proof and may have witnesses that substantiates my claim.\r\n\r\nI am writing to you with regard to my 6 year wrongful inclusion in a watchlist under the jurisdiction of the Granite City Police Department and the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC). I have reason to believe that I have been subjected to various forms of abuse, harassment, and exploitation as a result of this inclusion. This grievance pertains specifically to the actions of individuals within the Saint Louis Fusion Center, as well as its collaborative partners in State, Local, Tribal, Territorial Law Enforcement (F/SLTT), Air National Guard, and private sector partners.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the Saint Louis Fusion Center and affiliates, in conjunction with programs established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as the St. Louis Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), has engaged in practices that have violated established security protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and federal laws, notably the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have been subjected to unfair treatment that includes one or more persons acting under color of law willfully depriving and conspiring to deprive me of my rights protected by the constitution. This misconduct goes beyond mere allegations of negligence commonly associated with law enforcement collaborations with Fusion Centers.\r\nI have reason to believe that certain individuals associated with the operation have inappropriately disseminated my personal information for fraudulent purposes, potentially for personal gain, thereby compromising my privacy and potentially exposing me to unwarranted harm. These actions have not only caused me distress but have also raised serious concerns regarding the integrity and legality of the operations carried out by the Saint Louis Fusion Center and its affiliates. Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the revelation that there are instances of misuse of telecommunications satellites and systems, which may pose a threat to security and integrity. I have reason to believe that these individuals have been using intelligence tactics to instill fear and create a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this operation, I have experienced instances of cruel and unusual punishment, including sexual misconduct, harassment, bodily injuries, discrimination, exploitation, mail tampering, and medical violations due to the arbitrary exercise of power. Furthermore, I have encountered Intelligence operators who have been involved in concealing, altering, and destroying evidence relevant to the situation. Additionally, these operators have intercepted telephone lines in an attempt to hinder me from reporting the illicit activities to government authorities and attorneys.\r\n\r\nAs a law-abiding citizen, I expect that my rights and privacy are protected by those tasked with upholding the law. It is disheartening to discover that I have become a victim of misconduct and negligence within a system that is meant to safeguard the well-being of its citizens.\r\n\r\nI urge your office to conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take the necessary steps to rectify any injustices that have been inflicted upon me.\r\n\r\nYour expertise and oversight in this matter are crucial to ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of our national security systems. Your prompt attention to this request is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your dedicated service and commitment to upholding the highest standards of accountability and security in our government operations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\nGranite City, Illinois 62040-2013",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally lodge a complaint against the actions of individuals involved in the watchlist operation, which I believe have resulted in the commission of unlawful acts. It has come to my attention that certain individuals associated with the watchlist operation are engaging in tactics such as man-in-the-middle cyber attacks to obstruct, manipulate, and misrepresent communications, particularly when submitting online reports to the Office of Inspector General, Attorneys, and other Government entities. For the sake of transparency and accountability, I am submitting this complaint through Muck Rock to ensure that the public is informed of my concerns and to facilitate the proper filing and tracking of this complaint.\r\n\r\nMy involvement in this matter stems from being unjustly placed on a watchlist subsequent to my disclosure of misconduct within the Radiology Department at Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur, Missouri. I strongly believe that I obtain proof and may have witnesses that substantiates my claim.\r\n\r\nI am writing to you with regard to my 6 year wrongful inclusion in a watchlist under the jurisdiction of Granite City Police Department and the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC). I have reason to believe that I have been subjected to various forms of abuse, harassment, and exploitation as a result of this inclusion. This grievance pertains specifically to the actions of individuals within the Saint Louis Fusion Center, as well as its collaborative partners in Federal, State, Local, Tribal, Territorial Law Enforcement (F/SLTT), Air National Guard, Army, and Contractors.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the Saint Louis Fusion Center and affiliates, in conjunction with programs established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as the St. Louis Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), has engaged in practices that have violated established security protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and federal laws, notably the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have been subjected to unfair treatment that includes one or more persons acting under color of law willfully depriving and conspiring to deprive me of my rights protected by the constitution. This misconduct goes beyond mere allegations of negligence commonly associated with law enforcement collaborations with Fusion Centers.\r\nI have reason to believe that certain individuals associated with the operation have inappropriately disseminated my personal information for fraudulent purposes, potentially for personal gain, thereby compromising my privacy and potentially exposing me to unwarranted harm. These actions have not only caused me distress but have also raised serious concerns regarding the integrity and legality of the operations carried out by the Saint Louis Fusion Center and its affiliates. Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the revelation that there are instances of misuse of telecommunications satellites and systems, which may pose a threat to security and integrity. I have reason to believe that these individuals have been using intelligence tactics to instill fear and create a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this operation, I have experienced instances of cruel and unusual punishment, including sexual misconduct, harassment, bodily injuries, discrimination, exploitation, mail tampering, and medical violations due to the arbitrary exercise of power. Furthermore, I have encountered Intelligence operators who have been involved in concealing, altering, and destroying evidence relevant to the situation. Additionally, these operators have intercepted telephone lines in an attempt to hinder me from reporting the illicit activities to government authorities and attorneys.\r\n\r\nAs a law-abiding citizen, I expect that my rights and privacy are protected by those tasked with upholding the law. It is disheartening to discover that I have become a victim of misconduct and negligence within a system that is meant to safeguard the well-being of its citizens.\r\n\r\nI urge your office to conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take the necessary steps to rectify any injustices that have been inflicted upon me.\r\n\r\nYour expertise and oversight in this matter are crucial to ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of our national security systems. Your prompt attention to this request is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your dedicated service and commitment to upholding the highest standards of accountability and security in our government operations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\nGranite City, Illinois 62040-2013\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear Sirs:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the Texas Public Information Act, on behalf of\r\nTargeted Justice Inc.\r\nI request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be\r\nprovided to Targeted Justice:\r\n\r\n1. Records and documents pertaining to the permits issued under the Clean Air Act for all portable and emergency generators located in or servicing cell towers in the Houston, Texas area as of May 17, 2024. The information to be provided shall include at a minimum the following:\r\n\r\na - Permit Holder Name\r\nb - Exact location (address) of generator\r\nc - Generator make, year and capacity\r\nd - First permit date issuance \r\ne- Current permit date issuance and expiration.\r\nf - Identity of carrier or customer to be serviced by generator.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or  any other format where the information sought may be stored. As you know, the Public Information Act requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest.  Targeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. \r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 15,000 subscribers and over 115,000 thousands views a month in its\r\nSubstack newsletter. Thus, it is considered a news media organization  Targeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. \r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that it has no commercial interest other than informing the public about matters of public concern. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use.\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046 or 281-772-7668. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo for Targeted Justice, Inc.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",

In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning, describing or relating to Distributed Denial of Secrets,\r\n    abbreviated DDoSecrets.\r\n    \r\n    DDoSecrets is a non-profit whistleblower site founded in 2018 for news leaks\r\n    which is sometimes referred to as a successor to WikiLeaks and came to\r\n    international attention for its June 2020 publication of police documents,\r\n    known as BlueLeaks.\r\n    \r\n    You may limit the search to between December 2018 and the date the search is\r\n    performed.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request was received in this office on 5/22/2024. \n\nAfter careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope, did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the CISA program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \n\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the CISA FOIA Office. You may send an e-mail to FOIA@HQ.DHS.GOV, or call 202-343-1743 or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-NPFO-00460.
