        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDuring a preflight inspections the cabin crew tests and checks the battery, cabin, avionics, and cockpit for proper functioning and operation of an aircraft. Every pilot must make this final check to ensure the general integrity of their aircraft. Here\u2019s a brief overview:\r\n\r\n\r\nCabin Inspection\r\nThe first step, check that you have the require paperwork. The acronym ARROW can help you remember the five documents you need to bring:\r\n\r\nAirworthiness Certificate\r\nRegistration Certificate\r\nRadio Station License (only required for operations outside the U.S.)\r\nOperating Handbook\r\nWeight and Balance Data\r\nLegally, these documents and certificates must be inside the aircraft, and the airworthiness certificate needs to be on display where passengers can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second step:\r\n\r\nMake sure the cockpit switches and valve toggles are in the right position.\r\nSwitch the battery on and record fuel gauge readings  to compare to your visual inspection later.\r\nTurn off the battery and make sure the magnetos are off.\r\nClean the cockpit of all trash and any unsecured tools and make sure your seatbelts aren\u2019t fraying or loose.\r\nIf your plane has fuses, find the location and number of spares.\r\nExterior Inspection\r\nAll pilots should do a walk-around of their aircraft before a flight even if it was recently serviced and approved, it is always a good idea to double check all components. Pre-flight inspections ensure nothing is damaged or overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Third step :\r\n\r\nLook for loose rivets, bolts, nuts and safety-wired devices and any residue around these items.\r\nCheck brake pads and discs for thickness and look for rust and grooves.\r\nCheck tires for wear and flats by rolling the plane forward and backward.\r\nCheck oleo struts for proper inflation.\r\nTest rigged controls for free movement with no chafing  don\u2019t forget to remove the control lock.\r\nMake sure control hinge fasteners are secure.\r\nCheck the propeller for oil leaks, significant damage and loose blades.\r\nInspect the engine check oil levels and make sure air intakes are free of debris.\r\nCheck the exhaust pipe  make sure it\u2019s free of oil and black buildup.\r\nFuel system Check the fuel quantity and compare to cockpit gauges, look for correct octane color and debris and make sure fuel vents aren\u2019t obstructed.\r\nDrain sumps and sample fuel  be sure fuel doesn\u2019t keep dripping after.\r\nClean your windows, inside and out.\r\nReview your aircraft\u2019s performance data and emergency procedures.\r\nOnce you complete a thorough preflight inspection, you can take to the air with confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: PreFlight pilot checklist\r\n\r\n1.
