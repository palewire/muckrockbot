        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any letter sent by Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin containing the words \"I receive requests\". \r\n\r\n2. Any communications sent to or from United States Attorney Ed Martin which mention \"Wikimedia\", \"Wikipedia\", \"Wiki\", or *wiki* (i.e., using asterisks as wildcards such that a search would return, e.g., https://wikipedia.org/). \r\n\r\nThis request is limited to letters or communications sent to or received by Martin on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nThe Department has previously granted FIRE expedited processing in a related request. See Request No. EOUSA-2025-003687 (Apr. 24, 2025).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely an Interim United States Attorney's practice of sending letters seeking \"information\" for speech protected by the First Amendment. Specifically, Ed Martin has sent letters to (a) Georgetown University Law Center concerning its faculty members' classroom teaching (https://www.ncronline.org/files/2025-03/3.7.24%20Ed%20Martin%20letter%20%20to%20Georgetown%20law.pdf); (b) U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer concerning U.S. Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch (https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/); (c) U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia concerning comments made about Elon Musk (https://bsky.app/profile/robertgarcia.bsky.social/post/3lin33orhnk2r); and (d) a medical journal's editor (https://x.com/_Eric_Reinhart/status/1912958244768690407).  This request cocnerns an additional letter Martin sent to Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocNyx34Et19sKtlta0bTPPzSPcpi375T/view).\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-prosecutor-threatens-wikipedia\r\nb. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nc. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nd. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\ne. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\nf. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\ng. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\nh. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\ni. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\nj. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nk. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nl. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nm. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nn. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\no. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\np. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\nq. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/\r\nr. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-dept-schumer-inquiry.html\r\ns.  https://www.mediaite.com/politics/maga-u-s-attorney-sends-letter-to-house-democrat-over-criticism-of-elon-musk-who-you-call-a-dick/\r\nt. https://www.rawstory.com/trump-justice-department-2671190340/\r\nu. https://www.yahoo.com/news/acting-dc-us-attorney-ed-150929791.html\r\nv. https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/21/trumps-dc-us-attorney-launches-project-whirlwind-to-investigate-critics-for-their-speech/\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum, including the article published by The Free Press concerning Martin's letter to Wikimedia (https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-prosecutor-threatens-wikipedia). This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on educational institutions, academic publications, and elected officials to limit protected speech on matters on public concern. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry\" into Georgetown University Law Center due to its curriculum. Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter to Wikimedia was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin's letters are of particular interest because they are relevant to his nomination for the office of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. On April 2, 2025, ten members of the United States Senate sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, asking him to schedule a hearing to consider Martin\u2019s nomination. (Letter from Sen. Richard J. Durbin, et al., to Sen. Chuck Grassley, Apr. 2, 2025, available at https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25878847/ed-martin-hearing-letter-4225-final.pdf.)  At least one prominent commentator has cited Martin\u2019s efforts to chill curriculum at Georgetown (among other efforts to chill speech) as a reason for the Senate to refuse to confirm Martin. (Jack Goldsmith, The Senate and the Edward Martin Nomination, Executive Function (Apr. 3, 2025), https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/the-senate-and-the-edward-martin.) These concerns, raised by prominent intellectual and political leaders, indicate that Martin's letters raise possible questions about the government's integrity.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",
