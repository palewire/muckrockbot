The agenda for the April 17, 2023 Board of Education meeting indicates that the Board was asked to approve this settlement agreement, but no further information or cost details were provided.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the public, I am interested in understanding the nature and terms of this settlement agreement, as well as the costs associated with it. Please provide me with a copy of the settlement agreement, as well as any documents or communications related to the settlement agreement.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
