Doe 1-26 vs. Musk (https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293.77.2.pdf), Jeremy Lewin stated that he has been employed at USAID since 1/28/2025 as a Senior Advisor. He also declares he has never worked for Elon Musk or the USDS. Jeremy Lewin was also among the initial team of DOGE staffers that arrived at the CFPB on or around 2/6/2025. He was also identified as being on the staff list at the National Institute of Health along with other identified DOGE staffer in an article published in Wired on 2/24/2025. I would like to request the following information where possible:\r\n\r\nFor USAID:\r\n1. Any confirmation that Jeremy Lewin was formally hired at USAID on or before 1/28/2025\r\n2. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the USAID from another agency, any relevant details on that arrangement that you can share, including a memorandum of understanding (or similar document) outlining his duties and responsibilities of each partner, as well as emails between the USAID and the other agency about the arrangement. I would expect this to be on our around Feb 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor the CFPB and possibly USAID:\r\n3. If Jeremy Lewin was hired by the CFPB, any details you can share on that appointment, including if he signed the relevant onboarding paperwork as a new hire at the agency. I would expect this to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n4. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the CFPB from another agency, any relevant details that can be shared on the memorandum of understanding (or similar documents) outlining his role and the responsibilities of each partner in this arrangement, as well as emails about the detailing arrangements where available in either USAID/State or the CFPB. I would expect these communication to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor NIH and possibly USAID/CFPB:\r\n5. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the National Institute of Health from the USAID or CFPB, I would like to request the corresponding memorandum of understanding or other relevant documents about that arrangement, as well as any relevant email communications you can provide from any other agency to the National Institutes of Health about that arrangement. I do not have a precise date for this, but I would expect it to be in February 2025 before 2/24/2025\r\n\r\nFor US Doge Service:\r\n1. If you have any records that show that Jeremy Lewin was hired as an employee of USDS at any time in January or February 2025, I would appreciate that.\r\n2. Any communications between the USDS and other agencies (USAID/Department of State) coordinating the detailing of Jeremy Lewin to agencies like the CFPB alongside other staff employed by USDS\r\n\r\nI understand that you might not be able to provide me some agency-internal personnel records under FOIA exemptions 2 and 6, but I think it is in the public interest to understand the coordination among these agencies, and I would hope you would be able to provide me whatever relevant details can help provide more insight on what was being done in these partnerships. Please reach out if you need any clarification or want to give me feedback on my requests. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
