In our records search Bert Ulrich identified the films corresponding to each Space Act Agreement (SAA) as being the only movies NASA collaborated with, and provided the agreements as part of the list. I apologize for not explaining this more clearly and also not explaining that those SAAs for each movie is a complete list of movies for the time period specified in the request.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned NASA\u2019s Records Retention Schedule, which is available at following web address: https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/NPR_attachments/NRRS_1441.1.pdf. If permanent records exist they may have been sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in accordance with the Federal Records Act and NASA Records Record Retention Schedule. NARA\u2019s contact is available at the following website: https://www.archives.gov/foia/contacts.html.\r\n\r\nWe also talked about NASA points of contact who have their email and phone numbers listed online for media outlets and media researchers. You can find those contacts at the following website (some have email addresses and phone numbers listed) : https://www.nasa.gov/news/media-contacts/.\r\n\r\nHopefully this information is helpful.

A DRRTP provides a residential level of care for Veteran populations including medical, psychiatric, SUD, PTSD, and homelessness.

However, based on some of the web search results I found, it seems that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries, unless there is a clear causal link between the two\u00b2. For example, in Minnesota, a mental injury that results from a physical injury (such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder) may be compensable, but a mental injury that does not have a physical component (such as emotional distress or anxiety) may not be\u2074. Similarly, in product liability cases, courts have been more likely to award damages for mental anguish if the plaintiff suffered a physical injury or was exposed to a substantial risk of physical harm by the defective product\u00b2. Therefore, it seems that courts have generally favored a more objective and tangible approach to assessing damages, rather than a subjective and intangible one. However, this may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each case, as well as the applicable law and precedent.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Damages & Compensation for Mental Anguish in a Personal Injury ... - AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/damages-compensation-mental-aguish.html.\r\n(2) Mental vs. Physical Work Injuries (How Do They Differ?). https://mottazsiskinjurylaw.com/physical-vs-mental-work-injury/.\r\n(3) Damages and Compensation in a Personal Injury Lawsuit | AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/types-of-compensation.html.\r\n(4) Bodily Injury vs Personal Injury (Differences Explained). https://www.schmidtandclark.com/bodily-injury-vs-personal-injury.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. \u201cThen-Chief Judge Howell recently used an \"objective metric\"-Veterans Affairs disability ratings-to guide her in departing from the Heiser awards. See Schooley v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 17-cv-1376, 2019 WL 2717888, at ~7475 (D.D.C. June 27, 2019). VA disability ratings are \"a specialized agency s official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\" Id. at 74 ( cleaned up). Because VA ratings roll mental and physical injuries into one number, they facilitate a more objective approach to awarding damages. This is so because courts need not weigh whether certain injuries merit more money than others. See id.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for your message. It seems that you are interested in the use of VA disability ratings as a way of determining damages for mental and physical injuries in cases involving terrorism. Based on the web search results I found, VA disability ratings are a system that evaluates the degree of disability caused by service-connected conditions for veterans. The ratings range from 0% to 100%, and they affect the amount of monthly compensation and other benefits that veterans receive\u00b9\u00b2. VA disability ratings are based on the evidence submitted by the veterans or obtained from military records, and they may include a VA medical examination in some cases\u00b2.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using VA disability ratings as an objective metric for awarding damages is that they provide a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the veterans' ability to function and earn income. They also avoid the need for courts to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify\u00b3. Furthermore, VA disability ratings reflect the official determination of a specialized agency that has expertise and experience in dealing with service-related disabilities\u2074.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may also be some limitations and challenges in applying VA disability ratings to non-veterans or to injuries that are not service-connected. For example, VA disability ratings may not capture the full extent of the pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of enjoyment of life that victims of terrorism may experience. They may also not account for the differences in individual circumstances, such as age, education, occupation, or family situation, that may affect the severity and duration of the injuries. Additionally, VA disability ratings may not be available or reliable for some victims, especially those who are not U.S. citizens or residents, or those who have not sought or received medical treatment or diagnosis for their injuries\u2074.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while VA disability ratings may offer a useful and objective tool for assessing damages for mental and physical injuries in some cases, they may not be sufficient or appropriate for all cases. Courts may need to consider other factors and sources of evidence, such as expert testimony, medical records, personal statements, or witness accounts, to determine the fair and reasonable amount of compensation for each victim\u2074.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) 2023 Veterans Disability Compensation Rates | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/.\r\n(2) About VA Disability Ratings | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/about-disability-ratings/.\r\n(3) VACI's 2023 VA Disability Calculator - VA Claims Insider. https://vaclaimsinsider.com/va-disability-rating-calculator/.\r\n(4) Veterans\u2019 Benefits Rating and Rates | ChooseVA. https://choose.va.gov/disability/ratings-and-rates.\r\n(5) VA Math - How Combined VA Disability Ratings Are Calculated. https://themilitarywallet.com/va-math-combined-disability-ratings/.\u201d\r\n\r\n6. \u201cgiven \"that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries\" could it be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is incredibly significant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is an interesting question. I am not a legal expert, but based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b9 awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant in several ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, it shows that the court recognized the severity and impact of the mental injuries suffered by the plaintiffs, who were victims of a terrorist attack, and did not discount or diminish their claims based on the lack of physical injuries or evidence. The court stated that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are no less real than their physical injuries, and no less deserving of compensation.\\\"\u00b9 The court also noted that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are not merely transient or fleeting, but rather chronic and enduring, affecting their daily lives and relationships for years after the attack.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nSecond, it shows that the court applied an objective metric, namely the VA disability ratings, to determine the relative degree of injury suffered by each service-member plaintiff. The court explained that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating is a specialized agency's official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\\\"\u00b9 The court also stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating provides a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the plaintiffs' ability to function and earn income.\\\"\u00b9 The court further stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating avoids the need for this Court to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nThird, it shows that the court followed the precedent set by other cases involving victims of terrorism, such as Akins v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b2, where the court also awarded damages based on the VA disability ratings. The court in Schooley cited Akins as an example of a case where \\\"the plaintiffs' mental injuries were compensable even though they did not suffer any physical injuries as a result of the terrorist attack.\\\"\u00b9 The court in Schooley also noted that \\\"[t]he use of VA disability ratings as a measure of damages is consistent with other cases in this district involving victims of terrorism.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nTherefore, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant because it demonstrates the court's recognition, objectivity, and consistency in compensating victims of terrorism for their mental and physical injuries.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Schooley v.

The handbook also outlines the roles and responsibilities of various VA offices and officials in ensuring compliance with Section 504, as well as the procedures for handling complaints, appeals, and enforcement actions related to disability discrimination\u00b9.

However, based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination if it results in denying or limiting the access, benefits, or opportunities of qualified individuals with disabilities to any program or activity operated by the federal agency. According to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u2074, which prohibits discrimination based on disability in any program or activity operated by recipients of federal funds or conducted by a federal agency, discrimination may include:\r\n\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Denying a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services;\r\n- Affording a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services that is not equal to that afforded others;\r\n- Providing a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Otherwise limiting a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefits, or services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if an employee of a federal agency intentionally provides false or misleading information about a program or activity that affects the rights, privileges, advantages, or opportunities of individuals with disabilities, it could be considered a form of discrimination under Section 504. However, this would have to be proven by evidence and may be subject to legal defenses and exceptions.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) HHS Issues New Proposed Rule to Strengthen Prohibitions Against .... https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/07/hhs-issues-new-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-prohibitions-against-discrimination-on-basis-of-disability-in-health-care-and-human-services-programs.html.\r\n(2) Employment Laws: Disability & Discrimination - U.S. Department of Labor. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/publications/fact-sheets/employment-laws-disability-and-discrimination.\r\n(3) Disability Discrimination: Overview of the Laws - U.S. Department of .... https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/guid/ocr/disabilityoverview.html.\r\n(4) Disability Discrimination - U.S. Department of Education. https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/pro-students/disability-pr.html.\u201d\n",

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?\r\n\r\n26.   The VA already has a similar option called a \u201crefunding.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx\r\n\r\n27.   Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.   He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n29.   From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n30.   As I understand it, the VASP is set to be introduced at \u201c\u2026.the beginning of October\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n31.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ubxwuoe4rxoc2j80mrfo/Automated-Decision-Support-VBA-Home-Loans.pdf?rlkey=rs0pnc6x8j9lmm194fgiq9ez9&dl=0\r\n\r\n32.   There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct.

You said \u201c\u2026we can only discuss loss mitt options vaguely\u2026\u201d and I can only surmise you\u2019re pulling from the m26-3(4.03)(c) as it says \u201cTechnicians should determine if contact with a borrower is required during the AOS process.  If contact information in VALERI is no longer valid or numbers provided are not in service, the loan technician must attempt to locate a working number using an online search engine or other available search options and document the case notes.  If a borrower is in active bankruptcy or was active in bankruptcy during the default, no contact should be initiated with the borrower.  If the borrower initiates contact with VA, the technician should only discuss general information regarding the loan and the VA Home Loan Program and document a summary of the conversation in the case notes.\u201d Given the full context of m26-3(4.03)(c), speaking \u201cvaguely\u201d or \u201cgenerally\u201d only applies when a VA Home Loan technician is conducting an Adequacy of Servicing review. I\u2019ll ask again, is the VA currently conducting an Adequacy of Servicing review on my home loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Your loan is in active bankruptcy with Plant Home Lending and while you are under the protection of the Bankruptcy Courts and engaging with Planet Home Lending through the legal process of Bankruptcy we are unable to interfere with that legal process.  If you have questions regarding your loan while it is in bankruptcy we encourage you to discuss it with your bankruptcy attorney and the judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou did get a Relief of Stay from the courts to discuss loss mitt options, we can only discuss loss mitt options vaguely because your loan is still under the protection of the Bankruptcy Court.  We have tried to discuss loss mitt options with you, by inquiring if your ex-wife would be willing to execute/sign an agreement. You had previously informed the USB office that she is unwilling to sign which does impact your loss mitt options.  Any option to bring your loan current by modifying the original terms of your loan, would require your ex-wife signing that agreement.  The only option to bring your loan current without her agreement would be a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Monday, November 27, 2023 4:23 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: VA Hotline <VAHotline@va.gov<mailto:VAHotline@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: VA Hotline Case No. 11559463\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed, I don\u2019t mind asking again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are unable to address due to your active bankruptcy with Planet Home Lending\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPretend like we live in a world where VA employees can be held accountable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo your answers stay the same?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.meritalk.com/articles/va-officials-unions-voice-opposition-to-restore-va-accountability-act/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Friday, November 17, 2023 9:20 PM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov> <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Vahotline@va.gov<mailto:Vahotline@va.gov> <Vahotline@va.gov<mailto:Vahotline@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Fw: VA Hotline Case No. 11559463\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe VA's Under Secretary for Benefits Josh Jacobs said in a separate statement that he encourages any Veteran who is struggling with making their payments to visit www.va.gov/housing-assistance<http://www.va.gov/housing-assistance> or call 877-827-3702<tel:877-827-3702>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2018We at VA will do everything in our power to help Veterans stay in their homes\u2019 Jacobs said.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213930706/va-halts-foreclosures-veterans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Friday, November 17, 2023 5:03 PM\r\nTo: Corridon, Michelle, VBAVACO <Michelle.Corridon@va.gov<mailto:Michelle.Corridon@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Fw: VA Hotline Case No. 11559463\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for the response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately below this message should be an email from NPR reporter Chris Arnold asking if I\u2019m available Monday or Tuesday to talk about what I\u2019ve been experiencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hesitated because I wanted to say \u201cExecutive function and recall are issues for me even when I\u2019m not talking about something that\u2019s triggering like my home loan situation, so usually I try to mitigate those issues by corresponding via e-mail.

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys96eAuPQ$>\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys96eAuPQ$>\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys-d0gD9U$>\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysC7e0pl8$>?\r\n\r\n26.

Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.

From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys2Kd6U-g$>\r\n\r\n30.

The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims.

There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct.

From what I can tell, the additional commentary period was requested due to MBA/HPC being completely in the dark regarding a \u201cwritten program description, outline or framework\u201d for VASP.  The request for an additional commentary period is interesting considering it could be argued that MBA/HPC have commented on VASP already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing from Brendan Kelleher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Juan Valdez <jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org<mailto:jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 1:32 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: RE: GCR Referral - VASP Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with you on both things; first, mandatory means required, and second, this is a huge deal for the community. However, I don\u2019t believe the link to the \u201cLoss-Mitigation Options for Guaranteed Loans\u201d link is the correct link for the VASP. Mainly because MBA is asking for a period of public comment instead of a reopening of it. Moreover, the link already had the comment period close in January of 2023. Meanwhile, MBA is asking for a public comment period in their July 26 letter.

It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysq8bMT2w$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysWFVPPRk$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYyspIx6wwc$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The VA already has a similar option called a \u201crefunding.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4*20Chapter*209*20Refunds*20-*205-2017.docx__;JSUlJSU!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysH4oxF-o$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to recap, the program was supposed to be implemented on 7/1/2023, but wasn\u2019t. The VA hasn\u2019t shared anything specific with the groups representing mortgage companies. There are potentially as many as 147,000 veteran homeowners at risk of losing their homes and are most likely completely unaware of this new program.  The number of loans/mortgages potentially considered under the program is a number the VA (in my opinion) is not at all equipped to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Juan Valdez <jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org<mailto:jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org>>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2023 4:22 PM\r\nTo: mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com> <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: GCR Referral - VASP Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://app.salesforceiq.com/t.png?c=outlook&t=AFwhZf2HRzOX2wavcs3oNbv6sa5Jyt-GRZO48MjO7-Pj-WPNiS-nRWkHyHdNeOy-N01bNHcnxBPK2JVwqonW3JtFJo-jY4iajTm16ug2RCFrFeMhZwk9C5lTrvCVlz539f2GMQGesXKT]Hi Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you\u2019re having a great week.

Specifically, the portion that states \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  My understanding is that based on the plain writing,  \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d is a compound-complex sentence that has two independent clauses (VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy and VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim) joined by a coordinating conjunction (however) and one dependent clause (if the borrower reaches out to VA) that modifies the second independent clause. The second independent clause means that VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement if the borrower reaches out to VA. The phrase \u201cshould the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u201d is a conditional clause that describes a possible scenario that would result in the loss of entitlement for the borrower. It does not imply that VA will only discuss options and entitlements in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The VA employee I\u2019ve engaged with to this point has stated \u201cAt this this time, your loan has not terminated and therefore we cannot \u2018discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. When pressed for further clarification on the provided interpretation, the employee declined to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan this office (or someone within the VA with expertise regarding \u201cplain writing\u201d) please provide input on the plain writing meaning of \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 24, 2023 10:45 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>; Krejci, Louis, VBAPHNX <Louis.Krejci@va.gov<mailto:Louis.Krejci@va.gov>>\r\nCc: SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>; VA Hotline <VAHotline@va.gov<mailto:VAHotline@va.gov>>; Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; Jeffrey Badgley <jbadgley@badgleylawgroup.com<mailto:jbadgley@badgleylawgroup.com>>; Jon Masters <jmasters@badgleylawgroup.com<mailto:jmasters@badgleylawgroup.com>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Case No. 11190053 Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

So, while the servicer was updating the VA regarding the forbearances, unfortunately our system is not able to identify if was a CARES Act forbearance or a regular forbearance.  Home Lending reported to VA a special forbearance was added from 8/19/20 \u2013 11/1/20.

Further, I know your statement is nonsense (if not an outright lie) based on the VALERI loan information and notes provided pursuant to my 5/17/2022 FOIA request.

VA will be unable to assist as this appears to be an action against your servicer and we are unable to participate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The U.S. Congress has put in place a number of laws and practices to favor veterans as it relates to receiving benefits from the VA. This includes 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which requires the VA to help the claimant develop their claim for benefits. Furthermore, under Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed.2d 462, any interpretive doubt is to be resolved in favor of the veteran, as seen in the case of Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Why does the apparent CARES ACT information in VALERI as provided by Marcus Young not align with the information provided by servicer Planet Home Lending in their CFPB complaint response?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Will the VA please uphold it\u2019s duty to assist and obtain copies of servicer Planet Home Lending\u2019s \u201ccollection records\u201d from 5/01/2020 to 8/16/2022?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Is the VA a servicer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 6. Is the VA a servicer to my home loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Does the \u201cguidance\u201d you provided directly state the VA is prevented from speaking with a veteran borrower with a home under the protection of a bankruptcy court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Are you saying the \u201cguidance\u201d states the only time that the VA can engage with a veteran borrower regarding a home loan subject to the protection of the bankruptcy courts is after that loan terminates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. How is it possible for a loan to terminate that\u2019s subject to the protection of the bankruptcy court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d is a compound-complex sentence that has two independent clauses (VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy and VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim) joined by a coordinating conjunction (however) and one dependent clause (if the borrower reaches out to VA) that modifies the second independent clause. The second independent clause means that VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement if the borrower reaches out to VA. The phrase \u201cshould the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u201d is a conditional clause that describes a possible scenario that would result in the loss of entitlement for the borrower. It does not imply that VA will only discuss options and entitlements in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency.

VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysnT2_ixo$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysC7e0pl8$>?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiduciary relationships may be implied in law and such relationships are premised upon the specific factual situation surrounding the transaction, as well as the relationship of the parties.

Understand that every inquiry will ultimately be routed to this office to respond.  In effort to save you time and speed up the response time, we request that you only respond to this chain.  Of course, you may disregard this request but moving forward we will only be responding to this communication chain.\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the 46 items that you have identified below, and we determined responded to them previously in prior responses (which we can provide again) or there is no action for us to respond.  If there are ones that are new that we have not responded to feel free to let us know the specific ones and we will review and respond.\r\n\r\nAs for the inquiry in the Bankruptcy guidance, you have failed to provide the full guidance.  Please review the full guidance below and understand that we must comply with the full guidance.\r\n\r\nWhen a borrower files for bankruptcy protection, servicers are typically prevented from making contact.  Servicers must report the bankruptcy events in VALERI to include the type of bankruptcy (Chapter 7, 11 or 13 filing) and provide updates such as relief filed, relief granted, dismissed, or discharged.  VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\r\n\r\nAt this this time, your loan has not terminated and therefore we cannot \u201cdiscuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs for your request to engage with our attorneys, they do not engage directly with Veterans but through us.  If you have a specific question, we can reach out to them and request them provide us guidance.\r\n\r\nWe are also in receipt of your inquiry into the VASP program.  VA has not publicly announced this program and does have not a confirmed date for which a new program will be announced.  Implementation of new programs may take many months as the mortgage industry has to adapt policies and technology to any changes made to the VA Home Loan program.\r\n\r\nAgain, as we have advised you before you can either continue to argue our policies with us or you can begin to work with us and try to resolve your home loan delinquency once the debt is out of the protection of the Bankruptcy courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 8:58 PM\r\nTo: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSubject: Re: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a technical legal question that I don\u2019t know the answer to, but since it requires a servicing transfer (which is a highly technical process that requires cooperation), and the purchase of the loan from the servicer, the servicer would almost certainly need to consent to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe servicer or the VA-assigned technician may initiate the refund consideration process at any time during the life of the loan.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4*20Chapter*209*20Refunds*20-*205-2017.docx__;JSUlJSU!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysH4oxF-o$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDefinitely not my understanding as the program currently works.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce all required documentation is received from the servicer and borrower, and the VA appraisal has been completed, VA will conduct an analysis and complete a refund decision process.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the previous link. Granted, federal courts have found federal agency manuals have no \u201clegal force\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, but my understanding is that there are currently no loss mitigation options that a servicer must offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA circular 26-20-12 was rescinded on 7/1/2021, so it's not in effect anymore. For the time that it was, technically the VA Disaster Loan Modification and VA Streamline Modification would be an issue based on the wording that servicers were to \u201c\u2026ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current.\u201d They both use a trial payment plan in the place of a traditional loan modification packet.The streamline \u201cModification must realize at least a 10% reduction in principal and interest portion of the payment,\u201d so it\u2019s a little more strenuous than the disaster. I think part of the difference between the refund and VASP is servicers being \u201cmade whole,\u201d but it seems like the VA would have a good argument against making a servicer whole if a servicer failed to follow VA Circular 26-20-12. Granted, based on my experience, the VA seems deferential to what \u201cyou guys\u201d want, but it\u2019s still the federal government and I imagine they don\u2019t want to pay out money if they don\u2019t have to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe new program would be mandatory, and instead of a couple dozen of loans a year, it could be tens of thousands. There are a whole lot of other changes, but those are two big ones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you say \u201cmandatory,\u201d do you mean that the VA will require servicers to refer defaulted home loans where no other loss mitigation options are possible to the VA for VASP consideration? I know the VA started using \u201cAI\u201d to process disability benefit claims about a year before chatgpt was introduced, had considerable success, and expanded the \u201cpilot program.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019d be that hard to extend that to processing VASP consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nd From: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 7:48 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nCc: Kelleher, Brendan <bkelleher@mba.org<mailto:bkelleher@mba.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow in red are my best answers to your questions.

Your July 26, 2023 joint letter states in part \u201c\u2018As we understand VASP, the decision to modify a borrower's loan rests with the VA,\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Yet, servicers continue to evaluate their borrowers for all available options. In other words, servicers continue to communicate and engage with their delinquent borrowers until the VA approves the purchase of the loan and accepts transfer of the loan from the servicer.\u2019 This dynamic \u2018dislocates the traditional regulatory relationship between the servicer and the borrower.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan\u2019t the current VA refund process be initiated by the VA without the consent of the servicer? That is a technical legal question that I don\u2019t know the answer to, but since it requires a servicing transfer (which is a highly technical process that requires cooperation), and the purchase of the loan from the servicer, the servicer would almost certainly need to consent to it.\r\n\r\n Ultimately, isn\u2019t it solely the decision of the VA as to whether or not a loan will be refunded? Definitely not my understanding as the program currently works.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s different between the old refund and VASP? The new program would be mandatory, and instead of a couple dozen of loans a year, it could be tens of thousands. There are a whole lot of other changes, but those are two big ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d That\u2019s right, but my understanding is that there are currently no loss mitigation options that a servicer must offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Subsection c of section 5 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on # 2 and 3, do you guys have any information detailing compliance with VA Circular 26-20-12? Nope-no information on this.\r\n\r\nVA Circular 26-20-12 was in place from 4/9/2020 until 7/1/2021. In that time, what number of defaulted VA home loans were referred to the VA for possible refunding pursuant to 26-20-12? Haven\u2019t seen a number on this, but based on verbal information from the VA I would guess less than 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, do you guys represent Planet Home Lending? The Housing Policy Council does not represent Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 1:49 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nCc: Kelleher, Brendan <bkelleher@mba.org<mailto:bkelleher@mba.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they have not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.

The VA has a disaster loan mitigation option that could have been applied, but Planet Home Lending did not offer it. The CARES Act was signed in March 2020 and offered protection to homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government who are facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explicitly states that mortgage assistance must be provided regardless of delinquency status. The VA then issued a circular on April 8, 2020 that stated servicers have to give borrowers the opportunity to pursue all loss mitigation options to bring their loan current. The VA also issued a circular in July 2021 that introduced the COVID- 19 Refund Modification which allows for significant payment reductions and does not require a financial evaluation. Despite this, Planet Home Lending began court proceedings to obtain a foreclosure, and only offered a loan modification with a trial payment period in December 2021, which could have been done at any point during the default period. I rejected the modification offer due to the applicable laws and regulations that favor the veteran, such as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A and Brown v. Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I currently have a VA home loan through Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n2. In September of 2019 the area the property is located was under a mandatory evacuation due to Hurricane Dorian. The area was declared a federal disaster area in December of 2019.\r\n\r\n3. In 10/1/2019 I missed the first home loan payment.\r\n\r\n4. In December of 2019 I submitted an incomplete loss mitigation package to Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n5. On 1/3/2020 I was denied consideration for any loss mitigation options by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n6. The VA has a disaster loss mitigation option that allows for a loan modification absent a complete loss mitigation package.\r\n\r\n7. The VA disaster loan modification specifies a trial payment plan is used to verify income in lieu of a complete loss mitigation package.\r\n\r\n8. Planet Home Lending had the ability to offer a VA Disaster Loan Modification and/or a special forbearance at this point, but does not.\r\n\r\n9. In early 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic begins.\r\n\r\n10. On 3/27/2020, THE CARES ACT is signed into law.\r\n\r\n11. The CARES Act offers protection to homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government who are facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explicitly states in section 4022(b)(1) that mortgage assistance provided pursuant to the CARES ACT was to be provided \"...regardless of delinquency status.\"\r\n\r\n12. The Department of Veterans Affairs makes use of circulars issued via the official VA website to provide current policies and procedures to VA-approved lenders and servicers.\r\n\r\n13. The VA explicitly states via their official website that circulars are supplemental to VA home loan regulations.\r\n\r\n14. On 4/8/2020, the VA issues \u201cCircular 26-20-12\u201d via the official VA website in response to the CARES ACT.\r\n\r\n15. Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n16. I was eligible for a disaster loan modification for the entirety of my default period, but at no point was I offered a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n17. As a result of section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12, Planet Home Lending was required to offer a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Planet Home Lending continues to maintain that I was ineligible for any loss mitigation options, then the following applies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Section 3 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cThe borrower, not the servicer, is entitled to determine the period of the forbearance...\u201d\r\n\r\n19. Planet Home Lending stated the following regarding forbearance applied to my home loan:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n20. Subsection c of section 5 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n21. No such review was conducted or documented within the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI).\r\n\r\n22. The VA via 38 CFR \u00a7 36.4301 defines \u201chome equity\u201d as \u201c...the difference between the home's reasonable value and the outstanding balance of all liens on the property.\u201d\r\n\r\n23. The VA via 38 CFR \u00a7 36.4301 defines \u201creasonable value\u201d as \u201c...that figure which represents the amount a reputable and qualified appraiser, unaffected by personal interest, bias, or prejudice, would recommend to a prospective purchaser as a proper price or cost in the light of prevailing conditions.\u201d\r\n\r\n24. Per the applicable appraisal on file with the VA and Planet Home Lending, the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the home was/is $292,000.\r\n\r\n25. At the time of default, the principal balance of the home was $263,329.99.\r\n\r\n26. If the first forbearance period expired in August of 2020 and no loss mitigation options were possible, in July of 2020 Planet Home Lending was required to refer the home loan to the applicable VA Regional Loan Center for possible refunding, as there was no way the outstanding balance of the home exceeded the \u201creasonable value\u201d of $292,000.\r\n\r\n27. At no time did Planet Home lending refer the home loan to the applicable VA Regional Loan Center for possible refunding.\r\n\r\n28. On 7/1/2021, VA Circular 26-20-12 is rescinded.\r\n\r\n29. On 7/23/2021 the VA issues Circular 26-21-13.\r\n\r\n30. The purpose of VA Circular 26-21-13 is to provide \u201c...VA\u2019s waterfall of home retention options for helping borrowers affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\r\n\r\n31. VA Circular 26-21-13 also \u201c...announces the COVID-19 Refund Modification, a type of loan modification specific to those borrowers needing payment reductions when exiting COVID-19 forbearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n32. While section 5 of VA Circular 26-21-13 identifies eligibility criteria for borrowers to whom the home retention waterfall will apply, no such eligibility criteria is provided for the COVID-19 Refund Modification. It should be noted that Planet Home Lending presently reflects the last payment received on the loan as 1/1/2020.\r\n\r\n33. The COVID-19 Refund Modification is a type of loan modification that allows for significant reductions in a borrower's monthly payments. The indebtedness is secured as a junior lien in favor of VA that does not accrue interest or require monthly payments, and only becomes due when the property is sold, the loan is paid off, or the loan is refinanced. VA can purchase indebtedness up to 30 percent of a borrower's unpaid principal balance, and does not require a financial evaluation for every case.\r\n\r\n34. On 9/30/21 Planet Home Lending begins court proceedings to obtain a foreclosure.\r\n\r\n 35. On 11/4/2021 Isubmits a complete loss mitigation package to Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n36. On 12/27/2021 Planet Home Lending puts forth an offer for \u201cStandard Modification\u201d (ie Traditional Loan modification) with a trial payment period.\r\n\r\n37. Besides in name, the offer is a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n38. Due to the proceeding facts, I rejected the loan modification as it could have been offered at any time within the default period.\r\n\r\n39. The U.S. Congress has put in place a number of laws and practices to favor veterans as it relates to receiving benefits from the VA. This includes 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which requires the VA to help the claimant develop their claim for benefits. Furthermore, under Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed.2d 462, any interpretive doubt is to be resolved in favor of the veteran, as seen in the case of Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\n40. Per 38 USC \u00a7 5103A, the VA \u201c...shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant\u2019s claim for a benefit under a law administered by the Secretary.\u201d\r\n\r\n41. The VA home loan benefit is authorized by Title 38, Chapter 37 of the United States Code.\r\n\r\n42. The VA has a duty to assist my claims for benefits related to my home loan.\r\n\r\n43. The VA was and is aware of the issues described herein.\r\n\r\n44. The VA failed and refused to act concerning those issues.\r\n\r\n45. I was forced to declare bankruptcy due to the VA\u2019s failure and refusal to act.\r\n\r\n46. The home is in delinquency due to the VA\u2019s failure and refusal to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>\r\nSent: Friday, July 8, 2022 9:35 AM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will follow up with the Phoenix Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, July 7, 2022 11:06 PM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, the following hasn\u2019t been explained by the VA:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom: Michael Locke\r\n\r\nSent: Thursday, June 23, 2022 3:04 PM\r\nTo: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@VA.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@VA.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov> <marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain the discrepancies between what VA Phoenix Regional Loan Center Loan Administration Officer Marcus Young is saying and what my servicer is saying? I will most likely have further questions based on the answers I receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cYour loan was reported in default to the VA and due for the 10/1/19 installment. The reason for default was martial difficulties. When we talked to you on August 14, 2020, you confirmed that the reason for default was martial difficulties. According to our notes, you submitted a loss mitigation assistance application in 2019, however the servicer deemed the application incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlanet\u2019s investigation revealed that you initially submitted an online portal inquiry on December 3, 2019. The submission was partially completed, however, did not indicate whether the disaster hardship was resolved or ongoing. Planet issued both acknowledgement and missing items letters (enclosed) on that same date. To proceed with a Disaster Modification, Planet must verify that the hardship was resolved, the borrower returned to work and with no negative long-term change in the household income occurring. Despite numerous attempts, we did not receive the required information. Therefore, on January 3, 2020, a loss mitigation denial letter (enclosed) was issued.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. I responded to the proceeding as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the above what is reflected in VALERI? If so, does this mean I have CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance eligibility remaining? If so, why didn\u2019t the VA intervene at the time Planet Home Lending filed for foreclosure and say I had eligibility remaining? Planet Home Lending has provided conflicting information regarding the forbearance dates. Will the VA please clarify with Planet Home Lending the dates where CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance was applied to the property, as well as request and provide all documentation substantiating as much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Mr Young responded to the proceeding with the following:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2022 Repayment Plan: Approved: 8/19/20, start date: 5/1/20 estimated cure date: 10/1/20\r\n\r\n\u2022 Special Forbearance Plan: Approved: 8/19/20 estimated cure date: 11/1/20.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u2018In May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, July 5, 2022 11:26 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll loss mitigation package documents were submitted to Planet Home Lending as of 6/26/2022.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, July 5, 2022 10:22 AM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning Mr. Locke,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have responded to this inquiry previously in the official correspondence that has been sent to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Locke you have two options, 1) you can start working with VA and your servicer to resolve your delinquency or discuss an alternative to foreclosure, or 2) you can continue to argue with VA about policies and regulations at which we will not be responding because we have already provided you our response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Saturday, July 2, 2022 10:05 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer Marcus Young \u201cUnderstand at this point they have allowed for the authorized amount of time under the COVID FB requirement, they can consider extending forbearance if you qualify for an extended FB.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Planet Home Lending version of events is accepted, Planet Home Lending was required and failed to refer the loan to the VA for refunding in July of 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current.

Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. I responded to the proceeding as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the above what is reflected in VALERI? If so, does this mean I have CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance eligibility remaining? If so, why didn\u2019t the VA intervene at the time Planet Home Lending filed for foreclosure and say I had eligibility remaining? Planet Home Lending has provided conflicting information regarding the forbearance dates. Will the VA please clarify with Planet Home Lending the dates where CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance was applied to the property, as well as request and provide all documentation substantiating as much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Mr Young responded to the proceeding with the following:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2022 Repayment Plan: Approved: 8/19/20, start date: 5/1/20 estimated cure date: 10/1/20\r\n\r\n\u2022 Special Forbearance Plan: Approved: 8/19/20 estimated cure date: 11/1/20.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Saturday, June 18, 2022 12:57 PM\r\nTo: marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov> <marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov>>; Krejci, Louis, VBAPHNX <Louis.Krejci@va.gov<mailto:Louis.Krejci@va.gov>>; jordan.schaefer@va.gov<mailto:jordan.schaefer@va.gov> <jordan.schaefer@va.gov<mailto:jordan.schaefer@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@VA.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@VA.gov>>; lgylanational.vbaco@va.gov<mailto:lgylanational.vbaco@va.gov> <lgylanational.vbaco@va.gov<mailto:lgylanational.vbaco@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Re: Amended Servicer Ability to Offer Loss Mitigation Absent Loss Mitigation Package\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA Response:\r\n\r\n\"The circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\"\r\n\r\nMY Response to VA Response:\r\n\r\nAnd?\r\n\r\nWhatever measures the VA has put into place through circulars regarding COVID-19 are an extension of and supplemental to the CARES ACT. Congress explicitly stated in section 4022(b)(1) that mortgage assistance provided pursuant to the CARES ACT was to be provided \"...regardless of delinquency status.\"\r\n\r\n\"Purpose and Background. During the COVID-19 national emergency the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through its home loan program, continues to work toward keeping Veterans and stakeholders safe. On March 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), Public Law 116-136. The CARES Act protects borrowers with Federally backed mortgage loans who are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 national emergency. These protections are outlined below. The servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer. The Cares Act preempts section 3 of Circular 26-20-7, 'Special Relief for those Potentially Impacted by COVID-19.'\" See VA Circular 26-20-12(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.       VA Response:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnswered in previous letters and correspondence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Response to VA Response:\r\n\r\nThis was a yes or no question. If the VA provided an answer to a similar question asked at an earlier point, that similar question was a yes or no question as well and the VA never provided a yes or no answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.       This was a yes or no question. Please provide a yes or no answer.\r\n\r\n3.       This was a yes or no question. Please p",

So what gives?\r\n[image/jpeg]\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would logically follow if these questions had been answered previously, you would have simply said as much, like you did with the first question asked on 11/16/2023.\r\n\r\nI take your non-response concerning the duty to assist request to mean VBA Loan Guaranty is refusing the request.\r\n\r\nBecause they didn\u2019t follow VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe my servicer anything, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to figure out.\r\n\r\nI was married to a former DCF/CPS investigator/supervisor. You read that and you think whatever,  but what I mean is that child abused investigators for the state have no legal authority and generally have to BS to close out cases. When a report comes in and they go out to investigate, they generally don\u2019t have a warrant or enough to get a warrant, but they still have to close out their cases. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is or what their socioeconomic status is, no one is initially cooperative when a child abuse investigator shows up at their doorstep. So truth be told, they have to be pretty good at BSing. From what I experienced and what the spouses of other child abuse investigators substantiated, it\u2019s hard to turn off the exploitative BS when you come home. They have to do it so much, it becomes second nature. Most child abuse investigators burnout within a year. My ex did it for 9. Beyond that, she\u2019s 99.99th percentile IQ. Way smarter than me, and I imagine you as well. All of this is to say, I\u2019ve been well trained to deal with this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASP is still going to be a thing, correct? Even so, I\u2019m not counting on that. I\u2019m counting on the circumstances that spurred the NPR investigation aren\u2019t going to change. \u201cA tiger can\u2019t change its stripes,\u201d as the saying goes.\r\n\r\nBecause my servicer didn\u2019t follow VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe my servicer anything, and because you guys didn\u2019t ensure my servicer followed VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe the VA anything either.\r\n\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny and all records mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry into William David Foreman, also known as David Foreman or Dave Foreman. Mr. Foreman was a prominent environmental activist for over four decades and was co-founder of the organizations Earth First! and the Rewilding Institute as well as the founding publisher of the Earth First Journal.\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman was born on Oct. 18, 1946, in Albuquerque and died on Sept. 19, 2022, in Albuquerque. Specific proof of death is not required as Mr. Foreman\u2019s death has been widely publicized. This is a link to his obituary published in The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/us/david-foreman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release. For this request, the term \u201call records\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, any and all documents, correspondence (including, but not limited to, inter and/or intra-agency correspondence as well as correspondence with entities or individuals outside the federal government such as the subject and/or his affiliates, agents, contractors, representatives or lawyers), emails, letters, notes, audio or video recordings, telephone records, voicemails, telephone notes, telephone logs, text messages, chat messages, minutes, memoranda, comments, files, presentations, consultations, assessments, evaluations, schedules, papers published and/or unpublished, reports, studies, photographs and other images, and/or all other responsive records, in draft or final form.  This includes all attachments and/or linked documents noted in the responsive records.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press, and is made in the process of news gathering. The responsive records will also be provided to nonprofit public interest environmental organizations. As the requester, I am a qualified researcher with a nonprofit environmental organization, and will release and share the records in order to inform the public about Mr. Foreman\u2019s work and activities and to contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of the operations and actions of a government agency. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a fee waiver is not granted and there are fees as a result, I would appreciate if you would inform me of the estimated charges to receive the records in advance, if the estimated cost is expected to be more than $25.00.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that any of the responsive records will be exempt from disclosure, as FOIA exemptions must be identified, applied narrowly, and justified by the agency in light of the particular exemption as applied. However, if you determine that responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please separate the exempt portions from the nonexempt portions and release the nonexempt portions. For any records that you determine to be exempt from release, please provide a specific description of the agency record or portion of the record along with a particularized description of the legal basis for withholding it and the FOIA-recognized harm that the agency believes would warrant the withholding. \r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the responsive records electronically, if possible, by electronic download from a website, by attachment to email, or by CD or thumbnail digital storage. If the responsive records are not available electronically, then I request that you mail copies to me using the contact information below.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJennifer Thurston",

        "communication": "Hi Ms. Bunting,\r\n\r\nSection 6253 of the Government Code, which sets forth the 10-day compliance period under the Public Records Act, states that a response shall be made \u201cwithin 10 days from receipt of the request.\u201d  In general, when a statute does not specifically provide for \u201cbusiness\u201d days, calendar days apply.  With respect to when the 10 days begins to run, California Code of Civil Procedure section 12 provides that the \u201ctime in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, the 10 day period for response to a PRA request would begin the day after receipt of the PRA request.  For example, if an agency received a PRA request on Monday, September 25, the 10 day period would begin on Tuesday, September 26 and expire on Thursday, October 5.\r\n\r\nDo you need more time?\r\n\r\nMolly",

        "communication": "Dear Department Of Correction Records Access Officer:\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DOC custody (including DOC pre-release and/or home confinement) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\r\n  a. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance)  of 103 DOC 468 \r\n       Electronic Monitoring Program,\r\n  b. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\r\n  c. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\r\n  d.  Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants in the DOC ELMO program,\r\n  e.  Any documents, presentations, emails, or other records prepared by the Office of Investigative Services in relation to training staff slated \r\n  to work as a unit responsible for electronic monitoring,\r\n  f.  The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\r\n  g.  Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between DOC and Massachusetts Probation Service or \r\n   its ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DOC custody, pre-release, or home confinement\r\n3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the DOC\u2019s custody on pre-release, on home confinement, or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\r\n  a. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\r\n  b. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO \r\n  c. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, home confinement, etc.)\r\n  d.Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\r\n  e. County and Zip Code of individual\r\n  f. Age of individual\r\n  g. Gender of individual \r\n  h. Race of individual\r\n  i. Ethnicity of individual \r\n  j. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\r\n  k. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable. \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Correction. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nErin Stewart\r\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

        "communication": "Dear Subject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Electronic Monitoring DO Joshua Dankoff: \nThank you for your interest in public records of Massachusetts Department of Correction. Your request has been received and is being processed in accordance with the Public Information Act. Your request was received in this office on 11/9/2022 and given the reference number R000325-110922 for tracking purposes. Records Requested: Dear Department Of Correction Records Access Officer:\n\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\n\n1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DOC custody (including DOC pre-release and/or home confinement) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\n2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\na. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance) of 103 DOC 468\nElectronic Monitoring Program,\nb. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\nc. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\nd. Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants in the DOC ELMO program,\ne. Any documents, presentations, emails, or other records prepared by the Office of Investigative Services in relation to training staff slated\nto work as a unit responsible for electronic monitoring,\nf. The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\ng. Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between DOC and Massachusetts Probation Service or\nits ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DOC custody, pre-release, or home confinement\n3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the DOC\u2019s custody on pre-release, on home confinement, or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\na. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\nb. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO\nc. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, home confinement, etc.)\nd.Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\ne. County and Zip Code of individual\nf. Age of individual\ng. Gender of individual\nh. Race of individual\ni. Ethnicity of individual\nj. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\nk. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable.\n\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Correction. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\n\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\n\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\n\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoshua Dankoff\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\nErin Stewart\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice \nYour request will be forwarded to the relevant department(s) to locate the information you seek and to determine the volume and any costs associated with satisfying your request. You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question. \n \nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed. Again, thank you for using the MADOC Public Records Request Center.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Manuel de Dios Unanue (4 January 1943 \u2013 11\r\n    March 1992) who was a Cuban-born US journalist, radio show host, anti-drug\r\n    crusading editor of magazines Cambio XXI and Crimen, and editor-in-chief of\r\n    El Diario La Prensa, New York City's largest Spanish-language daily\r\n    newspaper.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

It is very difficult to provide an accurate estimated date of completion until our FOIA analyst reviews these records for responsiveness and we have a better sense of the number of pages and the sensitivity of the material. Our general expectation is that we will be able to send you a final response within 3-4 months.\r\n\r\nPlease know that this estimate may change dramatically based on the volume of work associated with our expedited COVID-19 requests that are in front of the queue and on the types of records we received from the Program office regarding your request.\r\nRegardless of the specificity of your request, we cannot accurately estimate the amount of time it will take to process the record until we understand both the volume and sensitivity of the records.\r\nWe hope that this response provides additional insight into why we are not able to give you a more precise estimated date of completion, and why we expect it will take 3-4 months for us to respond to your request.

E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n---------",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

G.\r\nL.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under\r\nthe Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement\r\nagencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for\r\ncollecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court\r\nreferrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary\r\nEducation\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in\r\nthe 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that\r\ncollection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has\r\ndefined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the\r\nU.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any\r\nactivity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities\r\n(including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any\r\nschool official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law\r\nenforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is\r\nreported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school\r\npolice unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during\r\nschool-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of\r\nwhether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and\r\nschool-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7\r\n(twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes\r\neach school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted\r\nduring the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up\r\nuntil the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an\r\nextract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law\r\nenforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a\r\nstudent at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the\r\nyouth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please\r\nprovide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related\r\narrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022\r\nschool year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each\r\nschool year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school\r\nyear (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please\r\nprovide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law\r\nenforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and\r\n2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the\r\nU.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year.\r\nFor each referral to law enforcement, please include the school,\r\ndemographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and\r\nDiscipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law\r\nenforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019,\r\n2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the\r\nrecords are produced).\r\n6.

The purpose of this\r\nrequest is to determine whether your school district and police department\r\nare complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice\r\nReform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants\r\nare carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may\r\nhave failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.\r\nMoreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may\r\nnot assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for,\r\ncompiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.\r\nFinally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall\r\nassess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of\r\ncompiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In\r\nthe event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not\r\nwaive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good\r\nfaith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless\r\nthe record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within\r\nten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or\r\ndata responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not\r\nsubject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for\r\nsuch assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you\r\nbelieve apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be\r\nredacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of\r\nnamed individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their\r\nentirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to\r\nrespond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D.

PRU responds as follows:\r\n\r\nRequest No. 1\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease provide the following information: Lists all technologies including the names of all products, manufacturers and model numbers for artificial intelligences, algorithms, databases, database locations, data analytic centers, softwares, facial recognition technologies, predictive policing programs, hot spot mapping systems, mobile applications, automated license plate readers, cameras; body worn or otherwise, audio and video recording equipment, stingrays, digital receiver technologies, reports, (including but not limited to police reports/citation numbers), financial documents, field interviews cards\r\nused in securing Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.354 citations/arrests for the time period 1/1/2022 through November 30, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\nResponse to Request No. 1\r\n\r\nAs discussed during our phone conversation on December 12, 2023, LVMPD does not track the technologies used to facilitate arrests. In order to determine if technologies, products, databases, etc. were used, each individual arrest report would have to be reviewed. Therefore, this portion of your request is burdensome.\r\n\r\nThe records you seek are not readily available and would be unduly burdensome to gather, compile, redact, and produce.\r\nA public entity need not produce records that are not readily available and would require research, compilation, and redaction to produce.  See Lunney v. State, 418 P.3d 943, 954 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2017) (recognizing that the agency was not required to respond to the burdensome request); Shehadeh v. Madigan, 996 N.E.2d 1243, 1249 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013) (holding that the Attorney General satisfied its burden by explaining that its staff members would have to go through all of the 9,200 potentially responsive documents by hand); Beckett v. Serpas, 112 So.3d 348, 353 (La. App. Ct. 2013) (determining that segregating 10-years\u2019 worth of files is unreasonably burdensome); Community Youth Athletic Ctr. v. City of Nat\u2019l City, 164 Cal.Rptr.3d 644, 676, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1425 (2013) (generally, an agency is not required to undertake extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, and in general, the scope of an agency\u2019s search for public records need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents) .\r\nTo determine if producing documents \u201cposes an unreasonable administrative burden,\u201d courts consider whether the general presumption in favor of disclosure is overcome by:  \u201c(1) the resources and time it will take to locate, compile, and redact the requested materials; (2) the volume of materials requested; and, (3) the extent to which compliance with the request will disrupt the agency's ability to perform its core functions.\u201d  Lunney, 418 P.3d at 954; cf.\r\n\r\nNAC 239.860 (defining \u201creadily available\u201d for purposes of State agencies as records that are \u201ceasily retrievable,\u201d \u201cnot confidential,\u201d and having a \u201cnature...such that an officer, employee or agent of the agency\u2026is not required to review the record to determine whether the record includes confidential information\u201d).\r\nPlease reformulate your request.  If you can narrow your focus to records that are readily available, LVMPD can proceed with researching your request.\r\n\r\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) does not maintain any particular record containing the information you are seeking. Moreover, LVMPD databases cannot \u201creadily compile the requested information.\u201d  See Public Employees Retirement System of Nevada v. Nevada Policy Research Inst., Inc., --- Nev. ---, 429 P.3d 280, 288 (2018), quoting Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t v. Blackjack Bonding, Inc., 131 Nev. 80, 87, 343 P.3d 608, 613 (2015).\r\nIn other words, your request requires LVMPD to do more than simply \u201c[s]earch[] an electronic database to produce existing records and data\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nPublic Employees Retirement System at 287, quoting ACLU of Arizona v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Child Safety, 377 P.3d 339, 346 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2016).  Rather, your request requires LVMPD to \u201ccompile information about the information [the database] contains.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nAs such, your request requires the creation of a new record, which LVMPD has no duty to do under the Nevada Public Records Act.  Public Employees Retirement System at 286.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest No. 2\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease provide all citation/arrest numbers for Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.354 and Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.353 (To include all Sub Sections) for the time of January 01, 2022 through November 30, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\nResponse to Request No. 2\r\n\r\nWe are actively corresponding with the appropriate unit(s) to determine what documents, if any, are responsive.\r\n\r\n Please be advised The Nevada Public Records Act permits public entities to \u201ccharge a fee for providing a copy of a public record\u201d as long as the fee does \u201cnot exceed the actual cost to the government entity to provide the copy of the public record.\u201d NRS 239.052(1). \u201cActual cost\u201d is defined broadly as \u201cthe direct cost related to the reproduction incurred by a governmental entity in the provision of a public records, including without limitation, the cost of ink, toner, paper, media and postage.\u201d NRS 239.005(1). The latter statute was amended in 2019 by the Nevada Legislature via Senate Bill 287. The legislative history indicates that public entities may charge for labor and personnel costs when compilation and redaction are required.\r\n\r\nWe will advise if there will be a fee after corresponding with the appropriate unit.\r\n You can expect to be updated on the progress of your request no later than 01/02/2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPublic Records Unit (PRU)\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Caitlin Downey.",

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

        "communication": "CDR U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command\r\nAttn: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office\r\n810 Schreider Street\r\nFort Detrick, MD 21702-5000\r\n\r\nAugust 23, 2023\r\n\r\nGreetings:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following decision for FOIA case number FA-23-0032/FP-23-0018994:\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2023, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was filed via MuckRock with the U.S. Army Medical Department asking for copies of records germane to award ID W81XWH2211105.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 2023, Glenn W. Field, Records Manager, U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, responded by stating this request had been forwarded to the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USMRAA). A subsequent communication from Nicole Schwab, Freedom of Information Act Specialist, USMRAA, also dated June 6, 2023, confirmed receipt of the request and stated it had been assigned a FOIA control number of 23-00415.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2023, Nicole Schwab, Freedom of Information Act Specialist, USMRAA, released a copy of a program announcement for the Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health Research Program, and on June 23, 2023, released a copy of a grant voucher for the program.\r\n\r\nFinally, on June 12, 2023, Robyn Mack, Communications Director, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), responded to a partial referral to the USAMRDC, now assigned a FOIA case number FA-23-0032/FP-23-0018994, notifying me that it had been rejected because the reviewing agency could find no records.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nIn my original FOIA request, I referenced a Politico article dated September 15, 2022, titled \"The Pentagon is funding experiments on animals to recreate \u2018Havana Syndrome\u2019\". You will find a copy of this article attached but for clarity's sake, a link can be found here: https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/09/pentagon-funding-experiments-animals-havana-syndrome-00086393\r\n\r\nThe Politico article identifies award ID W81XWH2211105 as being connected to Department of Defense-funded research that will use live animal subjects in testing and experimentation. The relevant sections of the article state: \r\n\r\n\"The Army in September awarded Wayne State University in Michigan a $750,000 grant to study the effects of radio frequency waves on ferrets, which have brains similar to humans, according to information on the grant posted on USASpending.gov.\r\n\r\n\"During the Wayne University study, researchers planned to expose the 48 ferrets to radio frequency waves for two hours a day for 60 days. This is expected to result in 'an exposure profile that is likely comparable to that which our embassy personnel received.' Twenty-four additional ferrets will receive 'sham exposure,' according to the summary.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use an animal like a ferret that has brain structures resembling the 'gyrencephalic nature' of the human brain; mice and rats do not fulfill this criteria, according to the summary. The brain tissue of gyrencephalic animals, like humans, ferrets, pigs and primates, resembles ridges and valleys, compared to smooth surfaces of the brains of lissencephalic animals, such as mice and rats.\"\r\n\r\nGiven that these highlighted sections reference tests using live animals, I believe the USAMRDC did not conduct a complete search of records. Had it done so it should have also found, at a minimum, a proposal created by Wayne State researchers and sent to the USAMRDC\u2019s Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO), an ACURO-formatted appendix, an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) approved protocol, and, potentially, adverse event reports.\r\n\r\nPer the USAMRDC ACURO website, these documents are required for all research funded by the Department of Defense. For instance, a section of the website covering protocol submission instructions (https://mrdc.health.mil/index.cfm/collaborate/research_protections/acuro/protocol_submission) states: \r\n\r\n\u201cInstitutions using United States Department of Defense (DoD) funds to support the use of animals in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) or training must adhere to DoD requirements for administrative review and approval by the Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO). Below is guidance on protocol and amendment submission.\u201d\r\n\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the June 12, 2023 decision by Ms. Mack and, at a minimum, requesting copies of the following records:\r\n\r\n- ACURO proposal;\r\n\r\n- ACURO appendix;\r\n\r\n- IACUC approved protocol;\r\n\r\n- Adverse Event Reports.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am also asking the USAMRDC to conduct an additional search for other records germane to award ID W81XWH2211105. It is likely that if the USAMRDC missed these records, it may have also missed others.\r\n\r\nI am also renewing my request for a fee waiver. The waiver would help to further public understanding of government-funded research currently underway on the subject of anomalous health incidents, aka Havana Syndrome. This subject has appeared in numerous articles since 2017 such as the one published by Politico on September 15, 2022, making it both a subject of public interest and one that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the USMRAA and USAMRDC do in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Mr. Skvarla,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have received your appeal to a FOIA request with tracking number\r\nFA-23-0032. We received it on 6 October 2023, and it was post marked 5\r\nSeptember 2023.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour original request was for the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID W81XWH2211105, granted to Wayne State\r\nUniversity for a\r\n\r\n\"TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH RESEARCH\r\n\r\nPROGRAM\", first referenced in a story published by Politico on March 9,\r\n2023, titled \"The\r\n\r\nPentagon is funding experiments on animals to recreate 'Havana Syndrome'\".\r\nWayne State\r\n\r\nUniversity was awarded the grant on September 15, 2022 through the\r\nDepartment of Defense's\r\n\r\nDefense Health Program, and is collaborating with researchers at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan\r\n\r\non the project. This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Grant Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Wayne State University and the Department of Defense\r\nconnected to this\r\n\r\nGrant\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request came to us by way of a referral from MEDCoe to USAMRAA to my\r\noffice at USAMRDC. Only a portion of the request was sent to our office for\r\ndirect response to you as the requester. That portion was specifically in\r\nreference to \"Presentations by Wayne State University and the Department of\r\nDefense connected to this Grant.\" (see Partial Referral Memo From USAMRAA -\r\nattached)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur response of \"No Records\" was solely to that portion of the request. This\r\nwas outlined in our response letter dated 12 June 2023 and sent to you on 27\r\nJune 2023. USAMRAA maintained the remainder of the request since they have\r\npurview of records for awards. We were only responsible to respond to the\r\nportion related to \"Presentations by Wayne State University and the\r\nDepartment of Defense connected to this Grant\". (see FA-23-0032 (Skvarla)\r\nResponse No Records - attached)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, your original request was for \"copies of records for award ID\r\nW81XWH2211105\". Your appeal is requesting additional records (i.e. ACURO and\r\nIACUC records) that would not be considered records of a contract award and\r\nwould therefore not be considered within the scope of your original request.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConsidering the above information, we have made the following\r\ndeterminations:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.\tYour appeal does not refer to any adverse determinations provided by\r\nour response letter referencing the portion of the request that we were\r\nresponsible to reply to.\r\n\r\n*\tIt does not appear you have appealed our decision making your appeal\r\nunactionable from our office.\r\n\r\n2.\tYou will need to submit a new FOIA request for any additional\r\nrecords from USAMRDC. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere may be a misunderstanding of the terminology used and how it is\r\ninterpreted within your description of records. If you would like to give me\r\na call at the number in my signature block, I'd be more than happy to assist\r\nin getting a request together for exactly what you are seeking. Also, I do\r\nnot believe you have received a final response from USAMRAA on the remainder\r\nof your request. They could possibly have more records.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you,\r\n\r\nCarl\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCarl Larcom\r\n\r\nFOIA/Privacy Officer\r\n\r\nU.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command\r\n\r\n810 Schreider St.\r\n\r\nSuite 206\r\n\r\nFort Detrick, MD  21702\r\n\r\n301-619-6852\r\n\r\n <mailto:usarmy.detrick.medcom-usamrmc.mbx.foia@health.mil>\r\nusarmy.detrick.medcom-usamrmc.mbx.foia@health.mil",

        "communication": "Mr. Stecklow,\r\n\r\nThis email is in response to your FOIA request that was received by the District of Columbia Housing Authority (\u201cDCHA\u201d) for the documents as specified in your FOIA request below.\r\n\r\nUnder the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act, D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-532 (2001) (\u201cDC FOIA\u201d), DCHA must make a reasonable effort to locate already existing records. FOIA does not require DCHA to conduct research for requesters, answer written questions, or in any other way create records (such as lists or statistics) to respond to a request. As such, DCHA can only provide requesters with existing documents or records maintained by the agency.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with DC FOIA, DCHA thoroughly searched the applicable agency records and found responsive documents, which are located here: Production<https://dchousing.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ogcTeam/EuJHrjdYrBhPgS6a3pGgrHAB72Kv-Y_x7gTGsyRJ9V9Jlw?email=154470-01554957%40requests.muckrock.com&e=76DMg5>\r\n\r\nRegarding any redaction of personal information or withholding of documents, such information or documents may be withheld pursuant to DC Code \u00a72-534(a)(2) to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your request, you are advised that under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you have the right to appeal to the Mayor or the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, the appeal must be in writing. The appeal letter should cite the \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line. If you mail the appeal, this should also be on the outside of the envelope. The appeal must include the following:\r\n\r\n1.            Copy of the original request.\r\n\r\n2.            Copy of your appeal letter.\r\n\r\n3.            Statement of appeal that includes the circumstances, reasons, or arguments advanced in support of disclosure.\r\n\r\n4.            Daytime telephone number, an e-mail address, or a USPS mailing address.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to:\r\n\r\nMayor\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\n1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\r\nSuite 407\r\nWashington, D.C. 20004\r\n\r\nIn lieu of mailing the appeal via USPS, an electronic version of the appeal can be e-mailed to the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel instead at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>. The electronic version must still meet all of the requirements for an appeal.\r\n\r\nA copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to DCHA\u2019s attention at foia@dchousing.org<mailto:foia@dchousing.org>.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact DCHA if you have any additional questions.\r\n\r\nEric D.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Alabama Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 146407\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nDate: May 31, 2023\r\n\r\nOpelika Police Department\r\n501 S 10th St\r\nOpelika, AL 36801\r\n\r\nAttn: FOIA Officer\r\n\r\nSubject: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request \u2013 Arrest and Associated Records of D\u2019Marius Howard on May 27, 2023\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, I hereby request access to and copies of all records held by the Opelika Police Department pertaining to the arrest of Huntsville Police Department Officer D\u2019Marius Howard for DUI on May 27, 2023, around 2:20 AM.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Any written reports, arrest records, citations, or charging documents related to the incident.\r\n- Any dash camera and body-worn camera footage of the incident.\r\n- Any radio transmissions, call logs, or dispatch records related to the incident.\r\n- Any witness statements or interview transcripts associated with the incident.\r\n- Any photos or other evidence collected as part of the investigation.\r\n\r\nThis request is made in part due to public interest in this matter. The arrest has been widely reported, including an article by WAFF 48 on May 31, 2023 (URL: https://www.waff.com/2023/05/31/huntsville-police-officer-arrested-dui-over-holiday-weekend/?outputType=amp).\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that a 2018 Attorney General's opinion in Alabama suggests that out-of-state residents do not have the same access to public records as in-state residents, I assert that as a journalist working on a matter of clear public interest, this request should be considered. Further, federal case law including Lee v. Minner has upheld the principle that there should be no geographic discrimination in the application of public records law.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: 1-845-748-0329\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Jordan Lassiter.",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nYour request for access to public records is denied because your request indicates that you reside out-of-state. \u00a736-12-40, Code of Alabama, provides citizens of Alabama the right to view public records with some exceptions. The Alabama Public Records Act is available only to Alabama citizens and grants no right of inspection to non-Alabamians. See McBurney v. Young, 133 S. Ct. 1709 (2013) and opinion to Honorable Howard J. Verner, Coffee County Constable, A.G. No 2018-030. Please provide documentation as to your Alabama residency. This may be accomplished by providing a copy of your current driver\u2019s license and/or other documentation showing your Alabama residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City respectfully declines to provide you the requested records because the requested materials (except the first page of an incident report and traffic accident reports) are considered law enforcement investigative reports, notes and statements and are privileged communications protected from disclosure. Alabama Code, \u00a712-21-3.1 creates a statutory exemption for law enforcement investigative materials to the Alabama Open Records Act. In addition, the materials requested contain information regarding law enforcement methods and techniques, as well as officer identities, and the disclosure of such information would be detrimental to the best interests of the public. Stone v. Consolidated Publishing Company, 404 So. 2d 678, 681 (Ala. 1981).\u00a0The investigative file was compiled as part of a law enforcement investigation of the Opelika Police Department and complete disclosure would be contrary to Alabama Code \u00a712-21-3.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Opelika, AL.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "Subject: Appeal of Public Records Request Denial - Request #23-84\r\n\r\n\r\nCity of Opelika, AL\r\nAttn: FOIA Officer\r\nOpelika Police Department\r\n501 S 10th St\r\nOpelika, AL 36801\r\n\r\nRe: Appeal of Public Records Request Denial - Request #23-84\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to appeal the denial of my public records request, #23-84, dated November 21, 2023. The closure reason provided stated that my request was denied because it indicates that I reside out-of-state, and the Alabama Public Records Act is available only to Alabama citizens.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the City's dedication to following relevant statutes, and I would like to address the concerns raised in the denial. According to the denial letter, the denial is based on \u00a736-12-40, Code of Alabama, which provides citizens of Alabama the right to view public records with some exceptions. The letter also references McBurney v. Young, 133 S. Ct. 1709 (2013) and an opinion to Honorable Howard J. Verner, Coffee County Constable, A.G. No 2018-030.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would like to emphasize that case law, such as McBurney v. Young, primarily addresses the issue of access to public records by out-of-state residents. However, recent federal case law, including Lee v. Minner, has upheld the principle that there should be no geographic discrimination in the application of public records law. It is crucial to consider this broader perspective, especially when the request is made by an investigative journalist working on a matter of clear public interest.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I assert that the denial incorrectly relies on an opinion, stating that \"opinion is not law.\" Opinions do not have the same legal weight as statutes or case law. The denial should be based on the applicable legal framework and established precedents rather than an opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a journalist working on behalf of public interest and transparency, I kindly request a reevaluation of my request. I am willing to provide documentation as to my Alabama residency, as suggested, by providing a copy of my current driver's license or other suitable documentation.\r\n\r\nI believe that the information requested is of significant public interest, especially considering the arrest of Huntsville Police Department Officer D'Marius Howard for DUI. This incident has garnered public attention and media coverage, as evidenced by the article from WAFF 48 on May 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that the City reconsider the denial of my public records request, taking into account the broader legal landscape and the public interest involved. If there are any concerns or additional information required, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
