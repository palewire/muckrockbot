        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to, mentioning, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry for Donald David DeFreeze, aka Cinque Mtume, aka General Field Marshal Cinque (November 16, 1943 \u2013 May 17, 1974).\r\n\r\nThis information has already been released previously. Page 11 of the FBI's 2003 FOIA log, attached, indicates journalist Tom O'Neill filed FOIPA request 961930-001 the year prior. The bureau reopened the request on May 15, 2003, and closed it again on May 3, 2005. The log discloses that 1,812 pages were released as part of that request, thus I am requesting all information previously released in that request and any additional information released since then.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. DeFreeze's privacy, as he passed away in 1974. I have attached a reproduction of an obituary, published in The New York Times on May 24, 1974.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
