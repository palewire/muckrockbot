The Office of Professional Responsibility Detainee Death Review (search the External Reviews and Analysis Unit within ICE OPR); \r\n2. The Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis report (search ERAU); \r\n3. the IHSC Mortality Review (search the ICE Health Service Corps); \r\n4. The IHSC Root Cause Analysis, if any (search IHSC). \r\n\r\nWe request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and provide the following statements in support of our request under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. At the time of this request, ICE deaths in custody have doubled the highest levels from previous years of the Biden administration. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/number-deaths-ice-custody-already-double-last-year-rcna154659#:~:text=NBC%20News%20Tipline-,The%20number%20of%20deaths%20in%20ICE%20custody%20is%20already%20more,of%20the%20six%20preceding%20years.\r\n2. The current rate of in-custody ICE deaths is on track to exceed any non-COVID year since FY17. See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11007418/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870381/\r\n3. Deaths in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread, ongoing media coverage and extensive policy advocacy and discussion. See, e.g. ,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211316303/ice-releases-investigation-into-immigrants-death-after-months-of-inexcusable-del; https://www.yahoo.com/news/number-deaths-ice-custody-already-133000592.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALCThkPLfU2ufNLo_I3yqmeUO38qEyUSI4U597M71FTc3npyfor0xVw-REfCt-2anUv5517ufGPQZZuU4KKiJ98axkk_ivGQf5e9Gu_gYZaHzjunplOd3-7tEQTfDoPBn6g0zjNvYt8aKSYJBBN9iLv2gvnes6k94yMIMemD-0yw; https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/us/migrant-death-ice-custody-recommended-release/index.html.\r\n4. There exist serious questions regarding the government's capacity to ensure safe and humane detention conditions that prevent deaths in ICE custody, based on available FOIA records obtained through federal litigation.  See, e.g., https://prismreports.org/2023/04/20/ice-gourgan-mirimanian-death-2018/; https://today.usc.edu/ice-deaths-custody-detention-medical-standards-violated-usc-study/\r\n5. ICE has announced its intention to expand its detention system, potentially increasing the numbers of in-custody death to even higher levels. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-announces-ongoing-work-optimize-enforcement-resources\r\n6. ICE has previously failed to accurately inform the public of its own internal agency conclusions about the events leading up to in-custody deaths. See, e.g., https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/April-2024-ACLU-Letter-to-ICE-on-Torrance-Detention-Facility.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is a compelling need to obtain these records as soon as possible so that the public can understand the consequences of ICE's current detention management processes as the agency seeks to expand the system beyond its appropriated limit of 41,500 beds.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
