Similarly, for all the other 6 sub offices, along with the chief of staff's office, the school construction authority, and the fund for public schools.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly simple request, it should not take the full sixty days to fulfill it.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",
