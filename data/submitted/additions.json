Any correspondence, reports, or memoranda exchanged between JPMorgan and relevant government agencies during the historical period when the institution may have been involved in the slave trade.\r\n\r\n2. Documents related to any investigations, audits, or regulatory actions taken against JPMorgan regarding its historical practices in connection with the slave trade.\r\n\r\n3. Any internal policies, guidelines, or communications within the National Archives and Records Administration that pertain to the preservation, classification, or accessibility of documents concerning financial institutions and their historical involvement in morally reprehensible practices such as the slave trade.\r\n\r\n4. Records indicating any efforts or initiatives undertaken by the National Archives and Records Administration to proactively disclose information related to the historical involvement of financial institutions, including JPMorgan, in the slave trade.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to draw your attention to relevant case law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- **National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004):** This case emphasizes the importance of balancing the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure when considering FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n- **Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989):** This case underscores the need for a functional analysis of the requested documents, focusing on the nature and content of the information rather than the identity of the parties involved.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease be aware of your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",
