Without an express legislative exemption, law enforcement personnel records are open to inspection just like those of other public employees and until the investigation is no longer active or until the agency head or his designee provides written notice to the officer who is the subject of the complaint that the agency has concluded the investigation with a finding to either proceed or not to proceed with disciplinary action or the filing of charges.\r\nShould you deny my request, or any part of the request, please state in writing the basis for the denial, including the exact statutory citation authorizing the denial as required by s. 119.07(1)(d), F.S.\r\nI will contact your office within one week to discuss when I may expect fulfillment of my request, and payment of any statutorily prescribed fees.

        "communication": "1. Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a FOIA request for the records described below. This request is organized into six sections: (1) summary; (2) preamble part 1 (copied from the preamble of my 16 March 2022 FOIA request, and included here to keep this request self-contained), (3) preamble part 2; (4) request for records; (5) request for fee categorization (same as the request for fee categorization in my 16 March 2022 FOIA request); (6) request for fee waiver (same as the request for fee waiver in my 16 March 2022 FOIA request).\r\n\r\n2. Preamble part 1\r\n\r\nNSA's policy decision to sabotage public cryptographic standards is described in an internal NSA history book released in 2013:\r\n\r\nhttps://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441/\r\nhttps://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up\r\n\r\nThe critical quote from NSA's history book is as follows: \"Narrowing the encryption problem to a single, influential algorithm might drive out competitors, and that would reduce the field that NSA had to be concerned about. Could a public encryption standard be made secure enough to protect against everything but a massive brute force attack, but weak enough to still permit an attack of some nature using very sophisticated (and expensive) techniques?\"\r\n\r\nThe first cryptographic mechanism standardized by NBS/NIST was DES in the 1970s. DES had a key size that was too small for security. The same history book reports that NSA had managed to \"convince\" the DES designers to reduce the key size.\r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, NIST proposed DSA, another cryptographic mechanism with a key size that was too small for security. A lawsuit by CPSR revealed that DSA had been secretly designed by NSA:\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200229145033/https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/14/59\r\n\r\nIn 2005, 2006, and 2007, ISO, NIST and ANSI respectively issued standards for Dual EC, a cryptographic mechanism with an NSA back door:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html\r\n\r\nThe same 2013 report describes NSA's budget to \"covertly influence and/or overtly leverage\" cryptography to make it \"exploitable\", in NSA's words. The budget had grown to a quarter of a billion dollars per year. Presumably NSA's budget for cryptographic sabotage is even larger today.\r\n\r\nNIST's Dual EC post-mortem concluded that \"It is of paramount importance that NIST's process for developing cryptographic standards is open and transparent and has the trust and support of the cryptographic community\":\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20220219211917/https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2017/05/09/VCAT-Report-on-NIST-Cryptographic-Standards-and-Guidelines-Process.pdf\r\n\r\nThe same post-mortem shows NIST's invited reviewers recommending clear transparency rules, such as \"full documentation of all decisions, and clear processes for the disposition of each and every comment received\", along with being open about \"what authorities were consulted\".\r\n\r\nIn 2016, NIST's call for proposals for its Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project stated that \"NIST will perform a thorough analysis of the submitted algorithms in a manner that is open and transparent to the public\":\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20220119113311/https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/documents/call-for-proposals-final-dec-2016.pdf\r\n\r\n81 FR 92787 says that this call for proposals establishes the criteria \"that will be used to appraise the candidate algorithms\":\r\n\r\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/20/2016-30615/announcing-request-for-nominations-for-public-key-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms\r\n\r\nRegarding the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, NIST stated in October 2021 that \"We operate transparently. We've shown all our work\":\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20211115191840/https://www.nist.gov/blogs/taking-measure/post-quantum-encryption-qa-nists-matt-scholl\r\n\r\nHowever, my current understanding is that, for five years, NIST was intentionally concealing NSA's involvement in this project. On 22 July 2020, NSA and NIST issued coordinated announcements that made reasonably clear NSA was involved but that did not reveal the details. On 2 August 2020, I asked \"What exactly has NSA told NIST regarding NISTPQC, regarding security levels or otherwise?\" NIST did not answer. NIST later tried to suggest that NSA has had only a minor influence, but NIST has provided no records showing what NSA's input actually was.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, most of the information that I've found on NIST's web site for this project is simply copies of submissions. NIST has posted some extra information, but the total volume of information in NIST's reports, web pages, and mailing-list messages obviously falls far short of \"all our work\". Anyone trying to obtain more than a superficial understanding of what has happened in this project rapidly discovers that critical information is missing. See Section 5 of the following paper for various examples of mysteries regarding the NIST process:\r\n\r\nhttps://cr.yp.to/papers/categories-20200918.pdf\r\n\r\nI've filed six FOIA requests with NIST since mid-2020. NIST has released a few dribbles of information, but in general NIST's responses have been very slow and obviously not complete. For example, my FOIA request #20210610-NIST eight months ago, which asked for \"copies of all NIST records of communication between NSA and NIST regarding the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project\", has, so far, produced zero records, even though NIST had already admitted in the following document that it made changes to a report based on \"feedback received (from the NSA)\":\r\n\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210508052729/https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/pqc-update-round-2-and-beyond/images-media/pqcrypto-sept2020-moody.pdf\r\n\r\nAnalyzing NSA's impact on this project will require not just seeing NSA's communication with NIST, but also tracing how NIST's decisions were made and analyzing the influence of the information that NIST received from NSA. If each step of this analysis requires dealing with another round of stonewalling from NIST then the analysis will obviously not be done in time to help the public make safe decisions regarding post-quantum cryptography.\r\n\r\nNSA's documented history of sabotage, along with its evident sway over NIST, makes NSA's influence on NIST a high priority to review, but it also seems likely that other entities have also been trying to sabotage NIST's process. As far as I can tell, NIST has no procedures in place to prevent attackers from influencing the project through pseudonyms, proxies, etc. Anything short of a full review of project records could easily miss evidence of attacks.\r\n\r\nEven without sabotage, getting cryptography right is challenging. Public review has identified security flaws in dozens of submissions and has identified many errors in the limited additional information released by NIST. Having NIST keep most of its analysis secret is a recipe for disaster. Given that NIST promised to be \"open and transparent\", and recently claimed to have \"shown all our work\", it's hard to understand why the full project records aren't already available to the public.\r\n\r\n3. Preamble part 2\r\n\r\nAfter the above preamble, my 16 March 2022 FOIA request asked for a copy of NIST's records regarding the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, and specifically for all records of NIST/NSA meetings mentioning the word \"quantum\", whether or not NIST views those meetings as part of this project.\r\n\r\nNIST did not comply with the FOIA deadlines. NIST did not produce any records until half a year later, after I filed a lawsuit. The records that I have seen from NIST so far are limited, and do not include any of NIST's communications with NSA:\r\n\r\nhttps://nist.pqcrypto.org/foia/\r\n\r\nThe records do show NIST intentionally violating its transparency promises. For example, NIST secretly marked various documents \"not for public distribution\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the records show NIST applying secret evaluation criteria rather than the official evaluation criteria. For example, NIST secretly compared submissions on the basis of private-key size.\r\n\r\nThe records also show NIST making one content mistake after another. For example, NIST secretly described a 2020 attack as \"a general timing attack on all Fujisaki-Okamoto schemes\" when in fact the attack was much more specific.\r\n\r\nIf NIST had actually \"shown all our work\" then various errors would have been corrected much sooner.\r\n\r\nI expected that, after the FOIA request and subsequent lawsuit, NIST would realize that it had promised to be \"open and transparent\" and would begin acting accordingly. Instead NIST appears to have become even more intent upon hiding records.\r\n\r\nFor example, NIST has recently announced a plan to standardize Kyber-512. NIST has issued a questionable claim that Kyber-512 meets the project's announced security requirements. Full details of how NIST arrived at this conclusion should have been made promptly available for public review.\r\n\r\nNIST says that it consulted \"among ourselves and with the Kyber team\" to reach this conclusion. However, NIST still has not published those communications.\r\n\r\nI have asked various questions regarding how NIST reached this conclusion. I find it clear from NIST's reaction that NIST's lack of transparency on this topic is intentional.\r\n\r\n4. Request for records\r\n\r\nPlease send me, in electronic form, a copy of NIST's records regarding the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project from 16 March 2022 up to the day that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nMy 16 March 2022 FOIA request similarly requested records up to the day that that request was processed. If NIST tells me the cutoff date that it assigned for my 16 March 2022 request then I will be happy to narrow this new request to cover only records starting from that date.\r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to, documents from NIST, documents from NSA, documents from other U.S. government agencies, and documents from foreign government agencies. This request also includes all records of NIST/NSA meetings during the specified period, whether or not NIST views those meetings as part of this project.\r\n\r\nIf there are any responsive records that are publicly available on NIST's web site as of the date that this request is processed, I request that NIST provide the specific URL for each record. Please clearly indicate any such parts of your response as \"Records already available\".\r\n\r\nFor all other responsive records, I request that NIST deliver the records in their original electronic format, such as PDF format, or as PDF scans for documents that were originally created on paper.\r\n\r\n5. Request for fee categorization\r\n\r\nPlease confirm that you're categorizing this FOIA request, like my previous FOIA requests, under the \"educational\" requester category. You can find my University of Illinois at Chicago profile here:\r\n\r\nhttps://cs.uic.edu/profiles/daniel-j-bernstein/\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a paper that I coauthored analyzing previous NSA sabotage of cryptographic standards:\r\n\r\nhttps://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/documents/dual-ec-20150731.pdf\r\n\r\nThis paper was published as pages 256 through 281 in \"The new codebreakers\", edited by Peter Y. A. Ryan, David Naccache, and Jean-Jacques Quisquater, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 9100, Springer, 2015, ISBN 978-3-662-49300-7. The paper already has more than 100 citations, according to Google Scholar.\r\n\r\n6. Request for fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees. I am filing this request via MuckRock to ensure that the results will be made easily available to journalists and to the general public. This disclosure will contribute significantly to public understanding of NIST activities, and I have no commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure.\r\n\r\nRegarding the six fee-waiver factors:\r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government\": 81 FR 92787 is a Federal Register notice calling for submissions to a government project and saying how the submissions would be evaluated. This is a request for the records of what has happened in that project.\r\n\r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities: Given records from the 1970s through the 2010s demonstrating NSA motivations, budgets, and activities to sabotage cryptographic standards (see links above), presumably NSA has also been trying to sabotage the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project. Documents released in the past have played a major role in public analyses of NSA sabotage and other problems with NIST's cryptographic standards; see, e.g., the role of these releases in https://cr.yp.to/talks.html#2013.12.28.\r\n\r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to \"public understanding\" as opposed to just \"individual understanding\": I have already posted a variety of in-depth analyses of the limited information that NIST has released so far regarding the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project (see, e.g., https://cr.yp.to/papers/categories-20200918.pdf), and will similarly post analyses of the further information released under this FOIA request. Cryptography is a technical subject, but there are more than 1000 members of the International Association of Cryptologic Research. There are also established mechanisms of bringing cryptographic news to broader audiences and to the general public, reflecting the public interest in the safety of Internet communication. I have been fighting NSA's cryptographic sabotage for 30 years (see, e.g., _Bernstein v. United States_, 176 F.3d 1132); together with colleagues, I have found many problems with NIST's previous NSA-influenced work on cryptography (see, e.g., https://cr.yp.to/newelliptic/nistecc-20160106.pdf), and have given talks to audiences of thousands based on NSA/NIST documents (see, e.g., https://cr.yp.to/talks.html#2013.12.28).\r\n\r\n(4) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute \"significantly\" to public understanding of government operations or activities: The limited information that NIST has released regarding the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project provides only superficial explanations of what happened in the project. It is impossible today for the public to track what inputs were provided to NIST and to analyze how the inputs influenced NIST's decisions, whereas transparency will give the public an answer to these critical questions. Transparency was also highlighted in NIST's Dual EC post-mortem (see link above), recognizing the effectiveness and importance of public disclosures of this type of information regarding cryptographic standards.\r\n\r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure: No. I'm a professor. I make my work available for free with no royalties. My interest is in ensuring the safety of cryptographic mechanisms used by the general public.\r\n\r\n(6) Whether any such commercial interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure: Not applicable. See #5.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any further information.\r\n\r\n---Daniel J. Bernstein",

Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking two categories of certification records:   \r\n\r\n* All certified officers \r\nAll law enforcement officers who are actively certified as of the date of this request (or when the request is processed). If your system maintains historical records of previously certified officers who are no longer active, please include them as far back as possible. If correctional officers are certified by your agency, please include them as well.  \r\n\r\n* Decertified officers\r\nAll law enforcement officers who have been decertified through revocations, voluntary surrenders, suspensions or any other actions going back as far as possible. Please include records for decertified correctional officers if available. \r\n\r\nData elements for certified officers:\r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST or state certification ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency start date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s previous departments/agencies (employment history), with start and end dates\r\n* Officer\u2019s positions and/or ranks at previous departments or agencies\r\n* Officer\u2019s original date of certification\r\n* Current status of certification (active, lapsed, expired, suspended, etc.)\r\n* Last action taken on certification\r\n* Date of last action on certification \r\n* Disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Dates of disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Training history/additional certifications of this officer, if available\r\n\r\nData elements for decertified officers: \r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence.\r\n* Officer\u2019s last department/agency, with start and end date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Decertification action taken (revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, etc.)\r\n* Date decertification action taken\r\n* POST case number, if applicable\r\n* Reason for decertification or similar action\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nLindsey Feingold\r\nData Journalist\r\nABC Owned Television Stations\r\n+1 (628) 230-7126",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, job title and code, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, original hire date, termination date, civil service status (e.g., classified, exempt, etc.), bargaining group and code, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nThis is a copy of my request for equivalent data spanning January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

        "communication": "I write to respond to the request below.  We do not have any contracts related to speed safety cameras because we do not have such a program.  And more generally, we didn't locate any responsive documents.  We did find one six year old two-page California state form template agreement signed by American Traffic Solutions that governs access to criminal history information.  But I assume that is not what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Silberman (he,him,his)*\r\nChief Deputy County Attorney\r\nOffice of the County Attorney for San Mateo County\r\n400 County Center, Sixth Floor\r\nRedwood City, CA 94063\r\nhttps://www.smcgov.org/countyattorney/profile/david-silberman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Here is why I include my pronouns: It's important to get pronouns correct to support belonging and respect in the workplace for everyone, inclusive of our LGBTQ+ communities. Pronouns are words used to refer to people and are often gendered (for example, she/her, he/him, or they/them). We cannot assume we can tell the correct pronoun for a person. As an ally, an easy way to normalize the use of self-identified pronouns is to include them in your email signature. If cisgender individuals step up to normalize the inclusion of pronouns, it will be more affirming for transgender and gender diverse people to share pronouns. Will you join me, in solidarity, to include your pronouns in your email signature? For more details on pronouns and how you can be in solidarity with gender diverse and transgender individuals visit: https://www.mypronouns.org/\n",
