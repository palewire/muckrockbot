        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records, documents, and communications responsive to Operation Hermit. Operation Hermit was a black propaganda campaign conducted by the OSS in Nanking, China between roughly June and September 1945, and was led by OSS officer Seymour I. Nadler. The program was first identified publicly by one of its participants, Elizabeth MacDonald (aka Elizabeth McIntosh), in her 1947 book \"Undercover Girl\". Ms. MacDonald describes the program as radio broadcasts providing a \"daily forecast based on the pseudo-sciences of astrology, fortune telling, face reading, palmistry, phrenology, and numerology\" (pages 200-201). Mr. Nadler confirmed his participation as part of an interview in 1989 for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project Information Series, where he references Ms. MacDonald's \"Undercover Girl\" by name. A third participant, Gordon Auchincloss, confirmed his role in an American Public Media radio documentary, \"Battles of Belief in World War II\".\r\n\r\nMr. Nadler's statement can be found on page 2 of the linked PDF: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/mss/mfdip/2004/2004nad01/2004nad01.pdf\r\n\r\nMr. Auchincloss's statements can be found in the linked transcript: https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wwii/transcript.html\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of privacy. All of the subjects have disclosed their participation in Operation Hermit and spoken of their roles publicly, as shown above. Additionally, there is no expectation that this request will interfere with any ongoing operations, nor should it reveal any trade secrets. Operation Hermit occurred 77 years ago, and the OSS ceased all operations shortly thereafter. \r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Creem Magazine, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
