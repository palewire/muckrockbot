His name is written \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 in Arabic. His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find a New York Times report on his death at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an assistant editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\n*** FORWARD THIS PUBLIC  RECORDS REQUEST TO PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER ***\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v.

The court document alleges \"Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 aimed to negotiate with V\u00e1zquez, recognizing that if Pierluisi\u2019sappointment failed, she would be positioned to become governor.\" The court document also alleges that \"V\u00e1zquez agreed to assist the FBI, starting by recording a conversation with , a Department of Justice contractor (\u201cContractor 1\u201d), who had been approached by , Puerto Rican Elected Official 1\u2019s cousin and a convicted felon, about arranging a meeting between V\u00e1zquez and Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 regarding the governorship.\" The document continues by saying that \"under the FBI's guidance, V\u00e1zquez recorded several conversations.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the document, the FBI closed the investigation in November 2019, citing difficulties in arranging meetings with V\u00e1zquez after she became governor. I have attached the document in its entirety to this communication.You can find the document here: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64868850/677/united-states-v-vazquez-garced/\r\n\r\nA news report revealed that Elected Official 1 and Elected Official 2 are former Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n.

In the event there are multiple records, please send them to me on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nPlease do a search of main file records alongside cross-reference records and an ELSUR (electronic surveillance) records. Additionally, please search the Sentinel database, the Investigative Data Warehouse, and the Data Integration and Visualization System.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request expedited processing for this FOIA request because of significant public interest and urgency. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, one of the people reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is currently Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner and is running for Governor of Puerto Rico under the New Progressive Party. Similarly, Thomas Rivera Schatz, another person reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is running for the Senate of Puerto Rico. The FBI report could have pertinent information relating to both of their campaigns, a highly relevant topic given the approaching November 5 election. Access to this information is crucial for informing the public about potential implications for governance and policy direction. \r\n\r\nAs a journalist, timely access to this information will enable me to report on critical issues affecting the electorate, ensuring that voters have the necessary context as they prepare to make informed decisions. Delays in obtaining this information could impede public understanding and discourse surrounding the election, which is a matter of public concern. Delaying access to this information could hinder public understanding of and trust in the electoral process and the candidates involved, which are essential for an informed electorate. The information in the document is time-sensitive  given the November 5 election, which is less than 50 days away. There is significant public interest in the information within this report, given its relevance to current events and both politician's run for elected positions, which will impact voters and Puerto Rico public policy.\r\n\r\nIf any part of this request is denied, I would appreciate a detailed explanation for the denial, including the specific exemptions being claimed. Additionally, I would be grateful for your assistance in identifying any related documents that may exist.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am a freelance journalist recognized by multiple journalists associations who has worked for multiple local, state, and international publications. Any information gathered from this request will be used in reporting about politicians in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",

Any/all emails sent to the Kent School District Board of Directors email address: kentboardmembers@kent.k12.wa.us\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE FOR THIS REQUEST\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 2024 - September 27, 2024\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

This would include all communications between the State Dept. and the cast, crew, and production company of \"Salvador.\" I request that you search the Central Foreign Policy File for these records, as NARA informs me that this would be the likely location of the records, which the Dept. of State retains from 1980 and later.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Specifically, I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Body camera footage: Any and all body-worn camera footage recorded by LAPD officers during the raid on the NoHo Diagnostic Center, including any video prior to, during, and after the incident where an officer\u2019s rifle was attracted to an MRI machine.\r\n   \r\n2. Incident Reports: Any official incident or field reports prepared by LAPD officers regarding the raid at the NoHo Diagnostic Center, including any documentation of the circumstances surrounding the raid, property damage, and the involvement of LAPD officers.\r\n\r\n3. Communications: Any and all communications (emails, text messages, memos, etc.) between LAPD officers, supervisors, and/or other relevant officials regarding the planning, execution, or aftermath of the raid on the NoHo Diagnostic Center. This includes any communications referencing cannabis cultivation, energy usage monitoring, and the distinct odor cited in the lawsuit.\r\n\r\n4.  Internal Investigation Records: Any records related to internal reviews or investigations conducted by the LAPD into the actions taken by officers during this raid, including the incident involving the MRI machine and any other property damage claims.\r\n\r\n5. Photographs: Any photographs taken by LAPD officers or forensic units at the scene of the NoHo Diagnostic Center during or following the raid.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of these records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you release any segregable, non-exempt portions of the records. Please do not withhold the entire set of records if certain parts are subject to exemption, in accordance with public records laws.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
