Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production. \r\n\r\nIf the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on an alleged investigation, you must certify that the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, it is inappropriate to deny production of any responsive material to this request, if the statute of limitations for the motive of investigation has elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB. \r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n//s// Eleni Karen Villios\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEleni Karen Villios",

We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Crillon C. Payne, II, aka Crillon Payne, aka Cril Payne  (May 28, 1943 \u2013 June 18, 2006). Mr. Payne worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1968 and 1976 as an undercover agent investigating domestic terrorist groups in the antiwar movement. He wrote a memoir about his experiences of his time at the Bureau which was published by Newsweek Books in 1979 as \"Deep Cover: An FBI Agent Infiltrates the Radical Underground\". In the book, Mr. Payne states that he was given informant designation \"LA 7852-S (Extremist)\" as part of a Domestic Intelligence Division operation known as the Special Informant Development Program (SPECTAR). According to Mr. Payne, this operation was created to target terrorist group the Weather Underground. As such, I am requesting all records related to Mr. Payne under all previously stated permutations of his name, LA 7852-S (Extremist), and LA 7852-S.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Payne's privacy, as he passed away on June 18, 2006. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Payne's obituary in the Austin American-Statesman. For expediency's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/statesman/name/crillon-payne-obituary?id=26854114\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Payne publicly revealed his work with the the Bureau in his memoir, removing any further concerns over privacy. The fact that he published a memoir about his undercover work would also make him a figure of public interest; \"Deep Cover\" received media attention in national newspapers and on radio stations at the time of its publication.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the KING COUNTY EXECUTIVE  or in the alternative KING COUNTY:\r\n\r\n1.\tI request a complete electronic .pdf copy of all public documents filed with the King County Superior Clerk of the Court in case # 21-2-11739-9 SEA - IRWIN ET ANO VS CITY OF SEATTLE.
