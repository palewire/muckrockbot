Should the fees exceed $100, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees as I am requesting the information on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how master jury lists are created. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\nIf possible, please provide the requested documents electronically.

Further, if you expect a significant delay in responding to this request, please contact me with information concerning when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption that justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
