RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . \r\nUnder the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been excluded, private email addresses, names of position candidates, and other private family information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Furthermore, be advised that the HIPAA limits release of medical information to patients and their guardian to ensure privacy. This information has also been redacted from these records in accordance with 5 ILCS 140/7(f) concerning preliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated as well as factual information that is inextricably bound up with deliberative material related to the many issues at play between the parties and subject matters mentioned in the request.

ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Records have further been redacted pursuant to 105 ILCS 5/24A-7.1 which states: \u201c Disclosure of public school teacher, principal, and superintendent performance evaluations is prohibited,\u201d and 820 ILCS 40/11, \u201cDisclosure of performance evaluations under the Freedom of Information Act shall be prohibited.\u201d Lastly, documents have been redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(m) exempts communications between a public body and an attorney representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation including attorney-client privileged material. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, you have the right to challenge this response under 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) by filing a request for review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request any and all internal directives or policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) regarding EOIR\u2019s process for contracting out, obtaining, and reviewing transcripts of hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ) for review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), as required by the BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.2(f). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request any current internal directives, manuals, memos, policy guidance, or other documents related to:  \r\n1.\tProcesses and procedures for assigning Digital Audio Recording(s) (\u201cDAR\u201d) to transcription contractors, including but not limited to Free State Reporting, Inc. (\u201cFree State\u201d), to be transcribed for purposes of creating the Record of Proceeding(s) (\u201cROP\u201d) for review by the BIA (see attached document for previous guidance, last updated in 2015)\r\n2.\tAny training, education, or certification EOIR requires of transcribers or the transcription companies with which EOIR contracts;\r\n3.\tAny policies and guidance regarding EOIR oversight and quality control over the transcription process, including any quality control checklists used by EOIR staff; \r\n4.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR takes when the transcription contractor sends back a defective or otherwise unsatisfactory transcript, for example one with significant typos, indiscernible notations, or other errors, including any processes for returning a defective or unsatisfactory transcript to the transcription contractor to be re-transcribed;\r\n5.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR and/or the transcription contractor takes when the DAR is partially or totally inaudible such that it cannot be properly transcribed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that EOIR waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding how and when immigration proceedings are transcribed for appellate purposes. CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations\u2014representing non-citizens before EOIR.  As a provider of legal services to non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients.\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is currently briefing a Petition for Review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in which defects in the transcript present a central issue on appeal. Information about the transcription process will help CAIR Coalition articulate legal arguments about our client's due process right to meaningful appellate review and advocate for broadly applicable law and procedures to be employed when a defective transcript is hindering review. Petitioner's opening brief to the Fourth Circuit is due on June 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request a ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request a ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit a ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting a ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

The FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard. The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances. Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. Please be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. EOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities. Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records. Your request has been placed in track three for complex requests. If you have filed an application for a fee waiver, EOIR will address your request in a separate letter. Additionally, if you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. If you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request.

The referral was received by JMD FOIA on September 7, 2023, and assigned the JMD tracking number identified above.  For your records, the Executive Office for Immigration Review identifying tracking number was 2023-53010.  The Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department of Justice, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by sending an email to JMDfoia@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM EST, excluding federal holidays.)  Please refer to JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER 131912 whenever you contact the Department regarding this request.  Sincerely,  Daniel Wagner FOIA Contact Justice Management Division\n",

        "communication": "Dear Sarah Norval:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on December 29, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201call other\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2024-REE-01682-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Mr. Nicholas Mantzaris electronically at Nicholas.Mantzaris@usda.gov<mailto:Nicholas.Mantzaris@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA3D8C.88B303C0]\r\nNicholas Mantzaris\r\nFOIA Analyst - Contractor\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\n1400 Independence Ave., SW, Room 4049D\r\nWashington, DC 20250\r\n(202) 690-5228\r\n\u2709     Nicholas.Mantzaris@USDA.gov<mailto:Nicholas.Mantzaris@USDA.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

I look forward to seeing this accurately reflected, as inaccurate information has been published to the public for over two years.\u00a0 I truly appreciate your consideration and cooperation in this matter. \nI am committed, and obligated by law, to adhere to the provisions of FOIA.\u00a0 I can assure you that the \"awaiting response\" status depicts an egregious violation of FOIA that is simply unfathomable to me. \nPlease contact me directly if you have any questions or would care to discuss otherwise.\u00a0 This mailbox is not monitored, and any responses previously sent to this mailbox were not seen. \nRegards, \nSarah Walsh \nFOIA Specialist \nwalshs@aurora.il.us \n \n \nREQUEST FOR PUBLIC RECORDS WILL BE PROCESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE  ILLINOIS FOIA. \nAll requests for public records will be governed by the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 ILCS 140/1, and exempt information will be redacted or otherwise withheld.

I was under the understanding the first hour was free. Please categorize the time required to handle this, and what staff by name and department were involved because the output requested was trivial and not meant to have to be output as a page within a PDF, along with the time to screen three pages. $33 seems excessive to review three pages as produced.\r\n\r\n2) The original request stipulated an electronic format if possible. \"E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\" Is it possible to have this file uploaded within the email rather than the PDF output? If not, please explain why this is not possible. \r\n\r\nThank you.",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\n\u00d6zal was born in Turkey and worked for the State Electrical Power Planning Administration from 1950 to 1952. He studied electrical energy and engineering management in the United States from 1952 to 1953, and returned to Turkey to work for the same government organization until 1958. \u00d6zal worked at the World Bank from 1971 to 1973, served as undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel from 1979 to 1980 and was appointed state minister and deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs from 1980 to 1982.\r\n\r\n\u1e26e founded the Motherland Party (Turkish: Anavatan Partisi) in 1983. \u00d6zal was elected Prime Minister of Turkey later that year, and served in that office until he became President of Turkey in 1989, later dying in office. \u00d6zal maintained close relations with U.S. President George H.W. Bush throughout the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the post Cold War era.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Petti\n\n",

Seidel wrote that \"In an effort to provide you with responsive records as expeditiously as possible, we are releasing documents from previous requests regarding your subject. We consider your request fulfilled. Since we relied on previous results, additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist. If this release of previously processed material does not satisfy your request, you may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nI am requesting an additional search for records. Thank you for your continued attention to this matter, and feel free to reach out with any questions you may have.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMatthew Petti",

I am not looking for 1357(g) agreements between DHS or its components and any local or municipal governments..While processing your request, the Department of Homeland Security located records that fall under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Accordingly, your request was referred to this office for processing and direct response to you.  Your request was received in this office on 9/5/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Per \u00a75.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period.  As the subject matter of your request is of substantial interest to two or more components of this Department or of substantial interest to another agency, we will need to consult with those entities before we issue a final response.  Due to these unusual circumstances, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182.

You are seeking copies of all 1357(g) agreements between the Department of Homeland Security or any DHS component and the State of Texas, the Texas Military Department, the Texas State Guard, or any other government organization belonging to or affiliated with the State of Texas. I am not looking for 1357(g) agreements between DHS or its components and any local or municipal governments. \n\nThese documents are available on the public ICE website at: https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g \n\nThe list of participating agencies are located by scrolling down the front page. \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

While I appreciate the provided documents, the response falls short of the specific information I requested.\r\n\r\nIn my original request, I specifically asked for a complete list of all employees, their job titles, and their annual salaries for the last three years (2020 to 2023), as well as training documents. The documents I received only included general job titles and salaries and did not include the requested training documents. Specific employee names and their respective salaries were omitted. \r\n\r\nThis absence of information does not satisfy the requirements of my original request. As per the Freedom of Information Law (Article 6, Sections 84-90, of the Public Officers Law), I am entitled to access this public information.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as stated in NY Committee on Open Government Advisory Opinion, FOIL-AO-19074, \"[...] records identifying public employees, their public employment history, and the salaries they receive are generally available to the public, for they are required to be maintained by an agency pursuant to law.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that you reconsider your decision and provide the complete and specific information I originally requested. If the decision is upheld, I request an explanation for the reasons behind the decision, specifically detailing the FOIA exemptions applied to withhold this information.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response to this appeal within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: 1-845-748-0329",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",
