De Hoyos has never made an arrest, please provide a sworn statement confirming his current employment status and exact dates of service with the McAllen Police Department, from his hire date of September 26, 2022, to the present (March 17, 2025).\r\nArrest Reports: If Officer De Hoyos has made arrests, provide all arrest reports from September 26, 2022, to March 17, 2025, where he is listed as the arresting officer, including:\r\nReport number\r\nDate of arrest\r\nCharges filed\r\nName of the individual arrested\r\nPlease note that records for cases no longer under active investigation are not exempt under TPIA and must be disclosed.\r\nDisciplinary Records: All disciplinary records, internal affairs investigations, reprimands, and citizen complaints involving Officer Edgar I. De Hoyos, from September 26, 2022, to March 17, 2025, including:\r\nDates of incidents\r\nSummaries of allegations\r\nResolutions or outcomes\r\nIf these records are held by the Civil Service Office per your prior referral, please coordinate with that office to fulfill this request or provide their direct contact for a separate submission.\r\nThis request pertains to existing records only, as required under TPIA. Given Officer De Hoyos\u2019 documented role as a Police Officer III in the Tactical Patrol Unit (effective September 9, 2024), it is implausible that no arrest records exist after over two years of service. Be advised that this is part of a broader, ongoing investigation into potential misconduct specifically police brutality, and any failure to comply fully with TPIA may result in escalation to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office for review.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is deemed exempt, please cite the specific TPIA exemption and provide non-exempt portions as required by law. If a determination from the Texas Attorney General is sought, please provide a copy of that request and the subsequent ruling. I expect a response within 10 business days, per TPIA \u00a7552.221.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The suspect was found with dozens of stolen packages in their vehicle. The arrest was captured on body-worn camera footage and praised as a strategic and effective takedown of a package theft ring.\r\nRequested Records:\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage:\r\n\r\nAll video and audio recordings from Detective Luis Q. and any other responding officers related to the undercover operation.\r\nFootage capturing the moment the suspect attempted to steal the package and their subsequent apprehension.\r\nAny footage showing the recovery of stolen packages.\r\nDash Camera Footage:\r\n\r\nAny available in-car camera recordings from unmarked or marked police vehicles involved in the operation.\r\nIncident and Arrest Reports:\r\n\r\nThe full police report detailing the sting operation and subsequent arrest.\r\nSupplementary reports from any assisting officers or units.\r\nPhotographs:\r\n\r\nAny images taken at the scene, including photos of the decoy package, the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and recovered stolen items.\r\nSurveillance or Third-Party Footage:\r\n\r\nAny surveillance footage collected as evidence, such as home security footage from affected residents.\r\n911 Call or Radio Dispatch Logs:\r\n\r\nAny radio communication or emergency call records related to the operation.\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making the footage and related records publicly accessible.

If any records are withheld or redacted, kindly specify the reasons and the applicable exemptions under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response within the timeframe prescribed by Florida Public Records Law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This incident involved Mr. Jones allegedly fleeing a traffic stop and subsequently calling 911 to report and boast about the incident, leading to his arrest.\r\n\r\n1. **Incident and Arrest Reports:**\r\n- The complete incident report, arrest report, and any supplementary narratives authored by the responding deputies concerning this event.\r\n- Any written statements provided by Mr. Jones during the incident or subsequent arrest process.\r\n\r\n2. **Audio and Video Recordings:**\r\n- All available dashcam and body-worn camera footage capturing the initial traffic stop, pursuit, arrest, and any interactions with Mr. Jones.\r\n- Audio recordings of 911 calls, including the call made by Mr. Jones, radio communications, and dispatch logs related to this incident.\r\n\r\n3. **Evidence Documentation:**\r\n- Records detailing any evidence collected during the investigation, including descriptions of items found in Mr. Jones's vehicle at the time of arrest.\r\n- Inventory logs of any items seized from the vehicle or from Mr. Jones at the time of arrest.\r\n\r\n4. **Internal Communications and Reports:**\r\n- Internal memos, emails, or communications within the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office pertaining to this incident.\r\n- Any reports or assessments generated as a result of this incident, including procedural reviews or evaluations.\r\n\r\nI request that these records be provided in electronic format, if available, to facilitate prompt and efficient processing.\r\n\r\n**Fee Disclosure and Request for Estimate:**\r\nI acknowledge that this request is being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I am prepared to incur any applicable fees associated with the processing of this request. To manage costs effectively, I kindly ask that you provide an itemized estimate of the anticipated fees prior to fulfilling the request. If certain documents can be excluded to reduce costs, please inform me so that I can make an informed decision on how to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or if specific documents are withheld, please cite the specific statutory exemption that justifies the refusal. Additionally, if certain records are only partially exempt, I request that the non-exempt portions be disclosed after appropriate redaction, as stipulated by the Florida Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for its fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fst-johns-county-sheriffs-office-15860%252Fpublic-records-request-records-pertaining-to-the-arrest-of-nicholas-jones-on-may-5-2019-183224%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AABKKmKAsDs7GOoNvbeM16C4Pdc%3A1tu03w%3A70MUPjxdKxOFwPUErZBJUeby7bM6GRbRLXoh4-Oi1V0 \r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: \r\n1. If you have requested body camera footage, these requests can be lengthy and will cost a minimum average of $80 but could cost several hundred dollars due to many factors: \r\n  * How long was the law enforcement encounter? \r\n  * How many deputies were on scene? \r\n  * How much redaction will be required for public release?\r\n2. If you have requested only paper documentation, these do not require a charge unless the report is length or requires significant redaction. \r\n3. Florida Statute 119 does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. \r\nIf any of the above factors change your request, you can reply to this email with the modifications you would like to make. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed. Thank you for using the Records Request Center.",

The request is very broad (all sworn and non-sworn APD staff\u2019s emails for just two different words) and is likely going to pull in large amounts of emails that would be time-consuming and burdensome to review. Most of it will likely be exempt from disclosure, as many emails will touch on crime data and investigations.\r\n\r\nIs there something more specific you are seeking?  The more targeted the request, the more likely we will be able to find something, review it, and disclose it to you more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nDoug McManaway\r\nAssistant City Attorney\r\nCity of Alameda\r\n2263 Santa Clara Avenue, #280\r\nAlameda, CA 94501\r\ndmcmanaway@alamedaca.gov",
