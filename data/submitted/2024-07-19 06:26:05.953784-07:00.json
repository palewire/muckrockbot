I would expect the responsive 911 call recording to be provided in an easily accessible digital audio file format such as WAV or MP3. I prefer the 911 call transcript/log be attached as an Excel or CSV file. Please also provide documents sufficient to show explanation of all codes included on the 911 Call Transcript or 911 Call Log. Please include the following details in responsive records. \r\n\r\nComplaint/Event/Incident Number\r\nDate/Time of call\r\nLocation of the call\r\nDescription of the event/incident\r\nInstructions given to caller by the dispatcher\r\nEvent/incident data, and any other results of service\r\nWhether police response was sent \r\n\u2022\tIf so, please provide follow data for police response\r\nEvent/Incident disposition\r\n \r\nPlease also include the following details for the 911 call:\r\n\u2022\tCall Code\r\n\u2022\tPriority Code\r\n\u2022\tDisposition Code\r\n \r\nI am NOT seeking names of individuals or any other personally identifiable information that might violate privacy protections. However, I will accept all documents subject to disclosure per Missouri Sunshine Laws and Public Records Laws.  \r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail activities of citizens of the St Louis community who are governed by the City of St Louis and served by St Louis Metropolitan Police Department, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest.  Increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of SLMPD\u2019s process for the collection, retention, dissemination and providing public access to records/documents related to public safety incidents contributes significantly to public understanding of our government\u2019s operations.  I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functions, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. If your agency maintains that exemptions apply, I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nThank you for submitting a records request to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.\u00a0 Your request was given reference number P020519-071624, for tracking purposes. Type of Records Selected:\u00a0Other Police Record Complaint Number (if applicable): Type of Incident (if applicable): Description of Request (if applicable):\u00a0  To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe recording and transcript/log of the 911 call made to St Louis Metropolitan Police Department on the evening of Saturday, July 13, 2024, at approximately 9:48pm regarding a driver who reported being harassed by other drivers while commuting from North St Louis City to South St Louis City along the streets of Union, Kingshighway and Chippewa.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records as electronic email attachments. I would expect the responsive 911 call recording to be provided in an easily accessible digital audio file format such as WAV or MP3. I prefer the 911 call transcript/log be attached as an Excel or CSV file. Please also provide documents sufficient to show explanation of all codes included on the 911 Call Transcript or 911 Call Log. Please include the following details in responsive records.\r\n\r\nComplaint/Event/Incident Number\r\nDate/Time of call\r\nLocation of the call\r\nDescription of the event/incident\r\nInstructions given to caller by the dispatcher\r\nEvent/incident data, and any other results of service\r\nWhether police response was sent\r\n\u2022 If so, please provide follow data for police response\r\nEvent/Incident disposition\r\n\r\nPlease also include the following details for the 911 call:\r\n\u2022 Call Code\r\n\u2022 Priority Code\r\n\u2022 Disposition Code\r\n\r\nI am NOT seeking names of individuals or any other personally identifiable information that might violate privacy protections. However, I will accept all documents subject to disclosure per Missouri Sunshine Laws and Public Records Laws.\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail activities of citizens of the St Louis community who are governed by the City of St Louis and served by St Louis Metropolitan Police Department, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. Increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of SLMPD\u2019s process for the collection, retention, dissemination and providing public access to records/documents related to public safety incidents contributes significantly to public understanding of our government\u2019s operations. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functions, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment.\r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. If your agency maintains that exemptions apply, I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fst-louis-metropolitan-police-department-671%252F911-call-to-slmpd-71324-169222%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAAj9WsQ4FuNTZD2Y9DnVAucV28%3A1sTuAK%3A-J738WVcW5XjxqlaArcsoIHA132dCeFuj48nRhyx0ro \r\nWe are currently reviewing your request and will contact you if any additional information is required.\u00a0 Otherwise, we will proceed with locating and gathering responsive records from various departments.\u00a0 Once records are located, they will need to be reviewed to determine what may be released at this time.\u00a0 All records are released in accordance with the Missouri Sunshine Law, Chapter 610 and SLMPD Policy. \r\nThere will be a cost associated with this request, and you will be contacted with more details prior to records being released.\u00a0 The earliest records are typically available is as follows: \r\n\u2022 Arrest Reports, Background Checks, Crash Reports, Police Calls for Service, Law Enforcement Requests and Non-criminal Police Reports are available within 10 days of submission of your request. \r\n\u2022 Criminal Police Reports, evidentiary material and other non-standard requests are available within 30 days of submission. \r\nIn the event your request will require additional time you will be provided with a detailed explanation of any further delay. \r\n \r\nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed. \r\n \r\nThank you!",

The Morgan County CORA Request policy states that the first hour is free and then each additional hour is $33.58. We would ask for a deposit of half to initiate the appropriate work. The overall total would be $134.32 with $67.16 being due before work begins.  I forgot to mention that if the number of hours is less than anticipated, you will not be charged and/or refunded.\r\n\r\nI have attached the normal CORA form for your information of our policies.
