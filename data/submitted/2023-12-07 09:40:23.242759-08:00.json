I am making this request on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and the release of this information is in the public interest, significantly contributing to a better understanding of habitual offender laws. My request for this information is not for commercial purposes.\r\nI kindly ask for a timely response to this request. If the retrieval of these records will take an extended period, please provide an estimated timeline for when I can expect access to or copies of the requested records.\r\nShould you deny any part of this request, I ask that you specify the exemptions that justify withholding the information and provide details about the available appeal procedures as per the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
