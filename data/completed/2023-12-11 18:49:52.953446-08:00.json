        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nNorth Thurston Public Schools (\u201cDistrict\u201d) received your public records request on November 5, 2021. Your request seeks all public records requests received by the District from January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021, as well as a complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s responses to those requests.\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests since 2010 have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question, and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses.\r\n\r\nPer RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing a first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by February 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions at this time.\r\n\nLisa Spector\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\n\r\nNorth Thurston Public Schools\r\n305 College Street NE\r\nLacey, WA  98516\r\n360-412-4418\r\npublicrecords@nthurston.k12.wa.us",

The number of DASNY staff members allocated to the CAURD program or cannabis-related activities.\r\n2. The portion of DASNY's budget allocated to the cannabis program.\r\n3. Updated figures on the expenditure of the state's $50 million pledge for the CAURD program.\r\n4. Details of the $5 million loan program announced in June 2023, including its source of funding.\r\n5. The updated term sheet for Social Equity Impact Ventures' involvement in the Cannabis Social Equity Investment Fund, including details of the management fee.\r\n6. All communications, contracts, and agreements related to the selection of Chicago Atlantic as the investor for the Cannabis Social Equity Investment Fund.\r\n7. Any records related to the questions listed in the article \"The questions DASNY will not answer about NY cannabis\" published on Syracuse.com.\r\n\r\nPlease note that according to the New York State Archives' General Retention and Disposition Schedule for New York State Government Records (LGS-01), many of these records should be retained and available for public access.\r\n\r\nIf any of the requested records are not available or are exempt from disclosure, please provide a detailed explanation for each individual record denied or redacted, citing the specific statutory exemption(s) you believe justify the refusal to release the information.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt response within five business days, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs.\r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields  in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF:\r\na)\tTracking number of the request [or appeal].\r\nb)\tDate of the request [or appeal].\r\nc)\tName of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs.\r\nd)\tOrganizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request [or appeal].\r\ne)\tWhether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well.\r\nf)\tSubject matter of the request [or appeal]..\r\ng)\tStatus of the request [or appeal] (pending, closed, etc.).\r\nh)\tFor requests [or appeals].that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request [or appeal] (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni)\tFee Information\r\na.\tFee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news media, other).\r\nb.\tWhether a fee waiver was requested.\r\nc.\tIf a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted.\r\nd.\tAmount of fees charged.\r\ne.\tAmount of fees paid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com.\r\n\r\nI am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. \r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field in FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination.\r\n1.\tThe  subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na.\tThe next and final FOIA Advisory Committee of the 2020 \u2013 2022 Term is June 9, 2022, where this matter will be discussed. This is the final term of this committee\r\nb.\tBased on records released regarding individualized tracking numbers, status and estimated completion dates of my FOIA requests and appeals, NARA may be engaging in massive false FOIA reporting. There can be no dispute  that such matters are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\nc.\tPlease refer further to my FOIA Public Comments regarding the March 29, 2022 Senate Oversight Committee FOIA Hearings, wherein DOJ OIP and NARA\u2019s OGIS were slammed for lack of FOIA compliance oversight. \r\nd.\tI plan to distribute information from this expedited FOIA request to members of the media and others via a vast distribution network.\r\ne.\tI am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media.\r\n\r\n2.\tInformation is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na.\tSee paragraph 1 above incorporated fully herein..\r\nb.\tI am recognized within to FOIA Advisory Committee Recommendation \u201cOGIS 2.0: Reimagining FOIA Oversight\u201d dated 05.04.2022 as an expert contributor \u201cRobert (Bob) Hammond, Citizen FOIA Advocate.\u201d\r\n3.\tIn any denial of expedited processing, NARA must repeat each paragraph and sub-paragraph above and state explicitly how my request does not meet the cited standards. A blanket statement without doing so lacks required content.\r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification  as to how my request stated herein does not qualify.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Hammond",

FOIAcomplaince@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 22-V.C.MUCK. NARA FOIA Request and Appeals Case Processing Logs FY 2021\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking via Muckrock.com:\r\n\r\n1.\tNARA\u2019s FY 2021 FOIA Operational Records FOIA Requests and Appeals FOIA Processing Logs.\r\na.\tThe FOIA Advisory Committee, approved Tech Committee Recommendation No. 2022-TS3 (Part 2) \u201cPosting FOIA Logs\u201d states:\r\n \r\nWe recommend that agencies proactively publish FOIA logs in the agency\u2019s electronic reading room (often referred to as FOIA Libraries) on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs.\r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields  in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF:\r\na) Tracking number of the request.\r\nb) Date of the request.\r\nc) Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs.\r\nd) Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request.\r\ne) Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well.\r\nf) Subject matter of the request.\r\ng) Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.).\r\nh) For requests that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni) Fee Information\r\na. Fee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news\r\nmedia, other).\r\nb. Whether a fee waiver was requested.\r\nc. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted.\r\nd. Amount of fees charged.\r\ne. Amount of fees paid.\r\n2.\tI will accept the Logs with their current data. Apart from the FOIA Advisory Committee recommendation that agencies should proactively post their FOIA logs, the logs exist in any event and are subject to prompt release under the FOIA.\r\n3.\tI am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n4.\tSee PDF for complete FOIA Request. See Requested Format.\r\n5.\tAlthough I am seeking expedited processing and prompt release of all records, I am seeking a rolling release of those records that are immediately available followed by a list of additional searches and estimated completion dates for them.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com.\r\n\r\nI am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. \r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination.\r\n1.\tThe  subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na.\tThe next and final FOIA Advisory Committee of the 2020 \u2013 2022 Term is June 9, 2022, where this matter will be discussed. This is the final term of this committee\r\nb.\tBased on records released regarding individualized tracking numbers, status and estimated completion dates of my FOIA requests and appeals, NARA may be engaging in massive false FOIA reporting. There can be no dispute  that such matters are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\nc.\tPlease refer further to my FOIA Public Comments regarding the March 29, 2022 Senate Oversight Committee FOIA Hearings, wherein DOJ OIP and NARA\u2019s OGIS were slammed for lack of FOIA compliance oversight. \r\nd.\tI plan to distribute information from this expedited FOIA request to members of the media and others via a vast distribution network.\r\ne.\tI am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media.\r\n\r\n2.\tInformation is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na.\tSee paragraph 1 above incorporated fully herein..\r\nb.\tI am recognized within to FOIA Advisory Committee Recommendation \u201cOGIS 2.0: Reimagining FOIA Oversight\u201d dated 05.04.2022 as an expert contributor \u201cRobert (Bob) Hammond, Citizen FOIA Advocate.\u201d\r\n3.\tIn any denial of expedited processing, NARA must repeat each paragraph and sub-paragraph above and state explicitly how my request does not meet the cited standards. A blanket statement without doing so lacks required content.\r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification  as to how my request stated herein does not qualify.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Hammond",

Request information is as follows: (https://foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/submissionDetails?trackingNumber=NARA-NGC-2022-001252&type=request) \r\n \r\n  * Tracking Number: NARA-NGC-2022-001252 \r\n  * Requester Name:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRobert Hammond \r\n  * Date Submitted: 05/31/2022 \r\n  * Request Status: Submitted \r\n  * Description:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n(FYSA. FOIA Join the fight for FOIA compliance. FOIAcomplaince@gmail.com) \r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 22-V.C.MUCK. NARA FOIA Request and Appeals Case Processing Logs FY 2021 \r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking via Muckrock.com: \r\n\r\n1. NARA\u2019s FY 2021 FOIA Operational Records FOIA Requests and Appeals FOIA Processing Logs. \r\na. The FOIA Advisory Committee, approved Tech Committee Recommendation No. 2022-TS3 (Part 2) \u201cPosting FOIA Logs\u201d states: \r\n\r\nWe recommend that agencies proactively publish FOIA logs in the agency\u2019s electronic reading room (often referred to as FOIA Libraries) on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs. \r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF: \r\na) Tracking number of the request. \r\nb) Date of the request. \r\nc) Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs. \r\nd) Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request. \r\ne) Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well. \r\nf) Subject matter of the request. \r\ng) Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.). \r\nh) For requests that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.). \r\ni) Fee Information \r\na. Fee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news \r\nmedia, other). \r\nb. Whether a fee waiver was requested. \r\nc. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted. \r\nd. Amount of fees charged. \r\ne. Amount of fees paid. \r\n2. I will accept the Logs with their current data. Apart from the FOIA Advisory Committee recommendation that agencies should proactively post their FOIA logs, the logs exist in any event and are subject to prompt release under the FOIA. \r\n3. I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional. \r\n4. See PDF for complete FOIA Request. See Requested Format. \r\n5. Although I am seeking expedited processing and prompt release of all records, I am seeking a rolling release of those records that are immediately available followed by a list of additional searches and estimated completion dates for them. \r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com. \r\n\r\nI am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request. \r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. \r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination. \r\n1. The subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na. The next and final FOIA Advisory Committee of the 2020 \u2013 2022 Term is June 9, 2022, where this matter will be discussed. This is the final term of this committee \r\nb. Based on records released regarding individualized tracking numbers, status and estimated completion dates of my FOIA requests and appeals, NARA may be engaging in massive false FOIA reporting. There can be no dispute that such matters are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\nc. Please refer further to my FOIA Public Comments regarding the March 29, 2022 Senate Oversight Committee FOIA Hearings, wherein DOJ OIP and NARA\u2019s OGIS were slammed for lack of FOIA compliance oversight. \r\nd. I plan to distribute information from this expedited FOIA request to members of the media and others via a vast distribution network. \r\ne. I am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media. \r\n\r\n2. Information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na. See paragraph 1 above incorporated fully herein.. \r\nb. I am recognized within to FOIA Advisory Committee Recommendation \u201cOGIS 2.0: Reimagining FOIA Oversight\u201d dated 05.04.2022 as an expert contributor \u201cRobert (Bob) Hammond, Citizen FOIA Advocate.\u201d \r\n3. In any denial of expedited processing, NARA must repeat each paragraph and sub-paragraph above and state explicitly how my request does not meet the cited standards. A blanket statement without doing so lacks required content. \r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification as to how my request stated herein does not qualify. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRobert Hammond \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/perseverance2013/109058/NARA_22-V.B.MUCK._NARA_FOIA_Request_and_Appeals_Logs_FY_21.pdf \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnational-archives-and-records-administration-129%252Fexpedited-foia-request-nara-22-vamuck-nara-foia-request-and-appeals-case-processing-logs-fy-17-129453%252F%253Femail%253Dfoia%252540nara.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj2tdGHKX1-c-t6oDvxXcze3A%3A1nwFU8%3AYLbZ2LAmpSQMyTXzCBTCUV3EPMT76A1DzW8TPC9n0Cw",

Given recent media attention and public interest in these incidents, it is important to gather as much information as possible to better understand these phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive documents in Excel or CSV format, covering a period of five years from the date of this request. The requested documents should include, but not be limited to, inter-agency communications, memos, messages, and any other relevant documentation related to the incident(s) in question. Additionally, please include any relevant terms, keywords or acronyms that may have been used by the Navy to identify these incidents, such as \"unidentified aerial phenomena\", \"UAPs\", \"unknown tracks\", \"anomalous aerial vehicles\", \"unidentified flying objects\", \"UFOs\" or any other similar terminology.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am requesting the documents in their entirety, including any deleted or redacted information. If any information has been redacted or withheld, please provide a detailed explanation for the redaction or withholding. Please also provide any legal justifications for withholding any responsive documents.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to several case laws that support my FOIA request, including but not limited to: the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552; Department of the Air Force v.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Bruce Blair, whose death has been widely\r\n    reported in the New York Times. See Bruce Blair, Crusader for Nuclear Arms\r\n    Control, Dies at 72\r\n    https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/bruce-blair-dead.html\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma Best\r\n    \r\n    Attachments:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    https://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/EmmaBest/86991/Fee20category20and20search20parameters.pdf\r\n    Upload documents directly:\r\n    https://https://www.muckrock.comhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ffederal-bureau-of-investigation-10%252Fbruce-blair-99156%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAAj2MnNxOre1oSHteLnfMK20oc%3A1k0LQB%3AVTvozq-V5o-tCzyX_HB52ppsD6c\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Rafael Cancel Miranda.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

        "communication": "Dear Cecelia,\r\n\r\nApologies for the confusion- the request should have said \"department\" rather than \"police department\". Please see below for the corrected request. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Puyallup School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide these records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent records to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

No explanation was given for why the records I requested could not be produced, as is dictated by the MTA\u2019s legal obligations under the New York Freedom of Information Law. Consequently I consider the request to have been denied and I\u2019m appealing on that basis.\r\n\r\nMy FOIL request asked for the following records:\r\n- Copies of all rider comments collected by the Metropolitan Transit Authority pertaining to the Queens Bus Network Redesign, submitted electronically via the project web page at the following URLs:\r\nhttps://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus (This was the original Queens Bus Network Redesign comment page which was later replaced with the URL below)\r\nhttps://contact.mta.info/s/forms/bus-network-redesign\r\n- I limited my request to comments submitted between March 29, 2022 and August 31, 2022\r\n- In the interest of complying with the Freedom of Information Law\u2019s privacy requirements, I asked to limit the request to the \u201ccomment\u201d text only, withholding entries for name, address & contact information. As the data was collected via electronic web form with separate entry fields, it\u2019s possible to extract the \"comment\" text by means of existing computer programs.\r\n- I requested raw data in machine-readable form, such as a CSV or Excel file.\r\n- I explained that the documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n- In the event that there were fees, I asked to be informed of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n- I specified a preference that the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nIn response to my request, the MTA sent me the attached document (03398573-Responsive Record).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there is no legal basis for the MTA to deny my request. The records I requested were collected by the MTA via its own website, presumably stored on the agency\u2019s own computer systems, allowing for redaction of personal information to comply with privacy requirements. Please refer to the attached  Committee on Open Government advisory opinion letter (FOIL-AO-19157). It can also be viewed online at: https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19157.html. \r\n\r\nI've pasted relevant quotes from the attached advisory opinion letter below:\r\n\r\n\"if information is maintained in some physical form, it would constitute a \"record\" subject to rights of access conferred by the Law [Babigian v. Evans, 427 NYS 2d 688, 691 (1980); aff'd 97 AD 2d 992 (1983); see also, Szikszay v.

Please refer to these two FOIL requests for electronic records submitted online.\r\n\r\n- MTA FOIL Request #17695 submitted by J.K. Trotter via Muckrrock on December 3, 2013. This request asks the MTA to extract \u201cComments\u201d and claims text entries for lost or stolen Metrocards submitted to the Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019s Balance Protection Program MetroCard eFix website:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/mta-balanceprotection-comments-9399/\r\n\r\n- MTA FOIL Request #00066415 submitted by J.K. Trotter via Muckrock on May 31, 2016. This request asks to extract demographic data submitted via the MTA\u2019s online surveys while redacting any personal data to comply with privacy requirements.\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/responses-to-mta-surveys-25929/\r\n\r\nAs required by the Freedom of Information Law, the head or governing body of an agency, or whomever is designated to determine appeals, is required to respond within 10 business days of the receipt of an appeal. If the records are denied on appeal, please explain the reasons for the denial fully in writing as required by law.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please be advised that the Freedom of Information Law directs agencies to send all appeals and the determinations that follow to the Committee on Open Government, Department of State, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Ave., Albany, New York 12231.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDouglas Breitbart",

On 9/11/2023 I made a request for \u201c\u2026all records related to the home loans in disaster areas FY 2019 risk assessment conducted by the Department of Veteran's Affairs Loan Guaranty Monitoring Unit. For reference, this risk assessment is mentioned in passing on page 18 of Veteran Affairs OIG REPORT #18-03979-204. Per the report, \"In July 2019, the quality assurance chief informed the audit team a preliminary \r\nrisk analysis had been conducted and that analysis did not necessitate a formal risk assessment of the disaster loans area.\" I am also requesting all e-mail or internal electronic communications from the applicable \"quality assurance chief\" related to the 2019 risk assessment concerning home loans in disaster areas.\u201d\r\n\r\n2. On 9/11/2023 I received an intake letter from the applicable VA FOIA office in response to said request.\r\n\r\n3. On 9/12/2023 I received an acknowledgement letter from the applicable VA FOIA office in response to said request.\r\n\r\n4. On 9/15/2023 I received fee estimate and invoice letters from the applicable VA FOIA office in response to said request. \r\n\r\n5. None of the documents provided by the VA in response to the request complied with the request requirements as required by the applicable statute and litigated in Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nhttps://casetext.com/case/citizens-for-responsibility-ethics-in-wash-v-fed-election-commn\r\n\r\n6. A good summation of Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n as it applies to the present situation is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201c Individuals seeking records under the federal Freedom of Information Act can immediately sue agencies that miss the statute's deadlines for properly responding to a request, a federal appeals court reaffirmed Tuesday.\r\n\r\nIn a victory for records requestors, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. sided with the government accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), unanimously ruling that if government agencies do not tell requestors whether they will fulfill the request within 20 days, requestors may sue the agency immediately without filing an administrative appeal.\r\n\r\nFederal agencies recently began arguing that acknowledging that the request had been received was sufficient, which meant that a requestor had to go through the appeals process before filing a lawsuit.\r\n\r\nThe case, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election Commission, put to rest the question of whether federal agencies could satisfy FOIA\u2019s 20-day response deadline by simply acknowledging the request and not detailing what documents would or wouldn\u2019t be handed over and why.\u201d\r\n\r\n7. The documents provided in response to the request by the applicable VA FOIA office do not state whether the request will or will not be fulfilled. \r\n\r\n8. Additionally, Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n determined that a response failing to state whether a request would or would not be fulfilled was no response at all.\r\n\r\n9. At most, an agency has 30 business days from the date of a request to provide a response to a noncommercial requestor (such as myself) before that agency loses the ability to charge search fees. \r\n\r\n10. It has been 40 business days since 9/11/2023. \r\n\r\nIn short, I don\u2019t have to wait for the administrative process to play out to sue for the requested records and I don\u2019t have to pay any fees for the requested records.

Records/documents relating to a private employer in which such employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the government, or under the direction of the government within the context of reasonable suspicion testing.\r\n\r\n7. Records/documents relating to if or in what manner an employer\u2019s policies can extend beyond the scope of the F.S. 112.0455 and the Florida Department of Financial Services\u2019 guidelines (if such records exist).\r\n\r\n8. Records relating to persons who can formally assess an employee within a hospital setting under the pretense of reasonable suspicion testing.

RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . \r\nUnder the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been excluded, private email addresses, names of position candidates, and other private information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. This information has also been redacted from these records in accordance with 5 ILCS 140/7(f) concerning preliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated as well as factual information that is inextricably bound up with deliberative material related to the many issues at play between the parties and subject matters mentioned in the request.

ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Lastly, documents have been redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(m) exempts communications between a public body and an attorney representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation including attorney-client privileged material.

You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. Thank you for your request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Robert Lowell Moore, Jr., aka Robin Moore (October 31, 1925 \u2013 February 21, 2008). He was an author of such books as The Green Berets, The French Connection, and Court Martial. All or some of this file has been released to a prior requestor(s); a portion was published by a now defunct blog, Entropic Memes, in 2008. Mr. Moore's case file number is identified by that requestor as 94-61092. Please see attached documents and the following link archived by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165610/http://www.slugsite.com/archives/897\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting any parts of Mr. Moore's file that have been released previously and those not yet released.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search for Mr. Moore. This would include any files the bureau may have on the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana, or JURE (Bureau file number 105-114543; Miami file number 105-6661).\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Moore's privacy, as he passed away on February 21, 2008. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. Please see attached documents and the following link, for an obituary published by the New York Times on February 23, 2008: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/books/23moore.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Per the bureau's prior release of Mr. Moore's file, at least one bureau memo, dated May 5, 1965, states of The Green Berets, \"classified information is contained in Moore's book.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored Mr. Moore in this period as well. Please see a clip of press coverage about The Green Berets, attached, which was archived by the CIA shortly after the May 5, 1965 bureau memo. This document can found in the CIA's CREST system and in the Reading Room on its website: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00149R000700610012-8.pdf\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how the bureau and other agencies handled investigations into journalists and writers who covered or disclosed the actions of American intelligence agencies is in the public's interest.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Near the bottom of the page there are links to 4 PDFs and 1 Zip file which have the documents from the case responsive to your request. One of the PDFs contains an exemption log detailing redacted and withheld content and exemptions applied. \r\n\r\nAlso as a courtesy, I have attached the Order Granting Summary Judgment, dated May 20, 2016, by King County Superior Court Judge Patrick Oishi, which permanently enjoins SPD from releasing any records from the case file regarding the death of Kurt Cobain that had not previously been disclosed; i.e., the records posted on the Blotter. I have also attached the Court of Appeals decision which upholds Judge Oishi\u2019s decision. \r\nAs such, we will now be closing this request. \r\nThank you, \r\nNina Afereti \r\nSPD Legal Unit \r\n \r\nIf you have any questions, you may send a message using the Police Records Request Center or call the Public Disclosure Desk at 206-684-5481. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nPenina Afereti \r\nSeattle Police Department \r\nLegal Unit \r\n \r\nSPD receives between 7, 000 and 8, 000 public records requests annually and is processing between 2, 500 to 3, 000 open requests at any given time. This may result in a slower than anticipated response to your request. Thank you for your \r\npatience. \r\n \r\nAs a reminder you can login at the Police Records Request Center\u00a0where you can access Police online information, manage your profile, submit record requests, track your request status, receive and send messages, make payments, view frequently asked questions, and download your records.",

I was curious if this dataset is representative of the 2023 fiscal year (from 7/1/2022 - 6/30/2023) as requested, or if the data provided was an as-of \"snapshot\" based on the report run date? I ask because it appears there are several employees with \"Company Seniority Dates\" and \"Employees State Begin Dates\" beyond the 2023 fiscal year. Can you also clarify which field should be considered the Employee Start Date, and may we also get a list of non-abbreviated \"Companies\"?",

Looking at some specific employees existing in 2022 that do not exist in the 2023 data, it appears that most of those records belong to \"Faculty, University Staff, and Political Jurisdiction Staff\" with record counts of those classifications having the approximate record count of the difference between the two files. \r\n\r\nWould you be able to clarify the effective date of the data (FY 2023 as requested, or a snapshot in time as of the run of the report), as well as the field that could be considered Employee Start Date? Would it be possible to include these records in the 2023 disclosure as they were provided in response to a separate request for 2022 employee compensation data?  If you could a \"key\" between the company abbreviation provided and their non-abbreviated descriptions/names, that would also be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTyler",

Contents of emails and attachments highlighted on attached email log released via FOIA N014357-101523. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including date of birth, social security number, parents\u2019 names, birth place, race/ethnicity, employee identification number, vital records\u2019 identification numbers, signatures, school transcripts, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Redactions were made pursuant to section 7(1)(v) of the FOIA, which exempts from release \u201c[v]ulnerability assessments, security measures, and response policies or plans that are designed to identify, prevent, or respond to potential attacks upon a community's population or systems, facilities, or installations, but only to the extent that disclosure could reasonably be expected to expose the vulnerability or jeopardize the effectiveness of the measures, policies, or plans, or the safety of the personnel who implement them or the public. Information exempt under this item may include such things as details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel or equipment, to the operation of communication systems or protocols, to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, or to tactical operations.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(v). Finally, redactions were applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

No our form does not make you pre-authorize costs of \"at least $20.\" It starts at $10-$20. $10 being the cost per police report. $20 being the cost per 911 call, body cam, and photos. We chose those number methodically to match our fee schedule. Per UCA 63G-2-203 Fees \"a Government entity may charge a reasonable fee to cover the governmental entity's actual cost of providing a record.\"\r\n\r\nWe have added the pre-authorization section on our online forms as some people fill them out without ever speaking with us or looking at the fee schedule. Having this section on the form assures that the public understands that there is a corresponding fee with requesting records.\r\n\r\nIn regards to your specific records request, there will be a fee of $10. Please let us know if you would like us to give you a call to complete payment and we will send you your police report.\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D9FD06.3BE64C80]",

        "communication": "The provided billing sheet is exactly what I was looking for, thank you. \r\n\r\nI would like to request the re-consideration of the fees associated with this GRAMA request. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it seems there may be a misunderstanding about the classification of CAD reports. These are not the same as \"police reports,\" and should not be billed as such. CAD reports are generally communication logs generated automatically during the course of a dispatcher\u2019s duty, often with minimal intervention from human personnel. Charging $10 per CAD report as if they were comprehensive police reports seems inconsistent with your city\u2019s comprehensive fee schedule. The listed staff time of one half hour only further emphasizes the point that the fee quoted is unreasonable.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe that my request serves a significant public interest. The records I seek are pertinent to a story of great importance to the community, and their release would contribute to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. As such, I believe a fee waiver would be appropriate in this case, and your refusal based on maintaining impartiality among media outlets does not seem to align with the spirit or letter of GRAMA.\r\n\r\nGiven the above factors, I kindly request that the fees associated with my GRAMA request be re-considered and waived. If this is not possible, I would like to escalate this matter and request the contact information for the Chief Administrative Officer for the Springville Police Department for a formal appeal. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPatrick Wells",

Though they aren\u2019t the same thing, they cost the same, as we go through the same retrieval, redaction and certification process. With this being a decently large request of 10 reports, the 30 minutes is very fair, if not less time than usual. For out of state media representatives, per GRAMA code 63G-2-203(5), we start charging for our time as soon as we start working on the request. I have attached a screenshot that shows the timer for your request, with this email in the background. We receive many requests regarding the same cases daily. Everyone has understood the significance of us charging the fees to keep impartial for every media outlet, large or small. I hope you can understand where we are coming from, by wanting to give each media outlet the equal opportunity to obtain these records. If you change your mind on paying the fees, please let me know and we can do payment and I will get the reports sent over immediately. I have inserted the appeal instructions below.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2026following the procedures in UCA \u00a763G-2-401. Please be sure to attach your initial request and denial letter when appealing. You may submit a request for appeal to the City Recorder, via mail at 110 S Main, Springville, UT 84663 within 30 days or via email at kcrane@springville.org.\u201d\n",

        "communication": "Ms. Crane,\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally appeal the fee imposed by the Springville Police Department in response to my Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA) request dated 10/9/23. The communications associated with this request are attached below this message. The fees imposed by Springville Police Dept, along with my contact information, are included in an attachment.\r\n\r\nThe request sought an electronic copy of the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports for all calls for service at 1803 E River Bottom Rd for the time period of January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. The Springville Police Department has classified CAD reports as \"police reports,\" consequently levying a charge exceeding $100 based on the city's comprehensive fee schedule, which stipulates a $10 charge per police report.\r\n\r\nFirst, I contend that CAD reports should not be classified as police reports. CAD reports are primarily data-driven, capturing basic information about calls for service, and are generally not completed by police officers. They differ significantly from police reports, which are narrative and provide detailed accounts of incidents. The reclassification and charging for each CAD report as a police report is not only misrepresentative but also unduly increases the cost of obtaining these public records, contrary to the spirit of GRAMA which aims to promote transparency and ease of access to public records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I request that the fees associated with this GRAMA request be waived entirely, given the significant public interest surrounding the events at the aforementioned address. The Springville Police Department\u2019s rationale to decline a fee waiver to maintain impartiality across media outlets is flawed. Impartiality is not achieved by denying fee waivers to all, but rather, would be accomplished through the provision of fee waivers to all media outlets, thereby leveling the playing field and truly adhering to the spirit of GRAMA which encourages public access to information. Utah\u2019s GRAMA, under Section 63G-2-203(4)(a), encourages fee waivers when releasing the records primarily benefits the public rather than a person. I assert that the routine denial of fee waivers based not on the merits of the request, but on a mistaken believe that this encourages impartiality, is in violation of GRAMA. The national discourse surrounding the incidents in question unmistakably demonstrates that the release of these records primarily serves the public interest.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in alignment with the provisions and the spirit of GRAMA, I strongly appeal for a full waiver of the fees associated with this request or, at the very least, a significant reduction by reclassifying the CAD reports and charging only for staff time.\r\n\r\nI am willing to discuss this appeal further at your convenience. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPatrick Wells",

(Nasdaq: SSTI) (formerly ShotSpotter), a leading provider of public safety technology solutions, today announced that the Fort Lauderdale Police Department has agreed to implement SoundThinking\u2019s Data for Good program. The program\u2019s official launch on August 1st coincides with National Night Out (NNO), an annual community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships.\r\n\r\nData for Good is a community-focused program that enables law enforcement agencies to share precision data about where and when gun violence occurs with non-law enforcement organizations. SoundThinking helps law enforcement customers identify offices of violence prevention, schools, city and county public health departments and other community organizations to receive gunfire data. By indicating where gunfire and potential trauma may be occurring, appropriate community resources can be deployed to help prevent future violence, address root causes, and provide assistance to those adversely impacted by exposure to persistent gun violence.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy embracing the Data for Good Program, we can now pivot to a holistic community-based approach to violence prevention, outreach, and community engagement,\u201d said Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Patrick Lynn. \u201cThis fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility for community safety rather than relying solely on punitive measures. By bridging the gap between law enforcement and the community, we can co-create effective solutions that deter crime and nurture an environment where individuals can thrive and reach their full potential.\u201d \r\n\r\nFort Lauderdale Police Department joins agencies in Miami-Dade County, FL, Baton Rouge, LA, Springfield, IL, and Mobile, AL, in implementing Data for Good programs. Through the program, these areas actively address gun violence and improve community ties with law enforcement.\r\n\r\n\"As a company, we believe that by harnessing data-driven insights and looking at them through a different lens, our customers can allocate resources to those impacted by the traumatic impact of gunfire,\u201d said Alfred Lewers Jr., Senior Director of Trauma Response & Community Engagement at SoundThinking. \u201cOur Data for Good program aims to support our customers\u2019 public health approach to gun violence reduction, and we are thrilled that the Fort Lauderdale Police Department is now among a growing list of agencies best-positioned to support community partners working to proactively and effectively address the root causes of gun violence.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how ShotSpotter assists community-based and civic programs, please visit our Data for Good page.\r\n\r\nSOURCE: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/01/2715842/0/en/Fort-Lauderdale-Community-Based-and-Public-Health-Groups-to-Benefit-From-SoundThinking-s-Data-For-Good-Program.html",
