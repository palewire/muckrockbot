Any policies, guidance, training, or directives to DHS or USCIS staff or agents concerning the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' \"consider[ation] of aliens' antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests,\" as announced in an April 9, 2025, press release available at https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism.\r\n\r\n2. Any search terms, queries, or programming used to identify content on social media for consideration in denying immigration benefit requests.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social). Federal agencies have granted my requests for expedited processing and full fee waivers on the basis that I seek information relevant to urgent news stories and matters of public interest.\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department of Homeland Security's response to an Executive Order concerning activity or expression that may be protected by the First Amendment, and the Department's announcement that USCIS will monitor social media.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic. The Department of Homeland Security issued a press release announcing the activity, reflecting its conclusion that information about the activity is worthy of immediate public attention.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the significant range of news coverage relating to the Trump administration's response to anti-semitism, particularly as it relates to higher education, examples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles published immediately after this morning's press release, which are likely to multiply in the hours and days ahead:\r\n\r\na. https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/g-s1-59149/immigrants-social-media-antisemitism-dhs\r\nb. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/uscis-to-screen-immigrants-social-media-for-antisemitism\r\nc. https://www.theblaze.com/news/exclusive-immigration-agency-to-scour-social-media-to-prevent-foreign-pro-terror-anti-semites-from-getting-benefits\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by United States officials in response to campus protests.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Struthers-Lugo,\r\n\r\nYour FOIA request was received in the Chicago District by email on April 10, 2025. Our FOIA tracking system is offline until Monday, so I am unable to provide a tracking number today. When the tracking system is online again, I will get a tracking number and provide it to you.\r\n\r\nYou are requesting a FOIA log for the fiscal year 2024 and are particularly interested in the subject of urban flooding, flooding as a natural disaster, and flood mitigation. Before I begin processing the request, please clarify a couple items for me:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Are you requesting information from the Chicago District only, or are you requesting information from the entire U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  We will have to extract the requested information from our FOIA tracking system since we do not regularly prepare FOIA logs. We should be able to extract a report that shows all the requests for fiscal year 2024, but we can also limit the report to those requests that contain certain keywords in the description. Would you like us to search for specific terms when extracting the information or would you like us to run a report that reflects all FOIA requests for fiscal year 2024? If you would like us to search for specific terms, which terms would you like us to use?\r\n\r\nThe processing time will begin upon receipt of your clarification.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nJenna McCreary\r\nParalegal Specialist\r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District\r\n231 S.
