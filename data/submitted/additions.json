Failure to comply with the Texas Public Information Act, including improperly withholding or redacting information without proper justification, may result in litigation, including but not limited to an Article 78 proceeding to compel compliance.\r\n\r\nSubject: Texas Public Information Act Request \u2013 Investigations and Surveillance of Black Lives Matter\r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Chapter 552 of the Government Code), I am writing to request access to specific records held by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) related to the investigation and surveillance of the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) and its local chapters (e.g., BLM Houston, BLM Dallas, BLM Austin) from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nRequested Information:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInvestigation Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tDates and brief descriptions of the last three instances where BLM or its local chapters were investigated or surveilled by the DPS.\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of investigation reports, including initial reports, progress reports, and final reports.\r\n\t2.\tContextual Documents:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal memos, emails, and other communications (including attachments) related to the initiation, conduct, and conclusion of the investigations.\r\n\t\u2022\tDocuments detailing the purpose of the investigations, the methodologies used, and the findings of each investigation.\r\n\t\u2022\tMeeting notes or summaries from any internal meetings where these investigations were discussed.\r\n\t3.\tPublic Safety Assessments:\r\n\t\u2022\tAssessments or analyses discussing the public safety implications of these investigations.\r\n\t\u2022\tRisk assessments or threat evaluations that were conducted as part of or in conjunction with these investigations.\r\n\t4.\tPolicies and Procedures:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to the surveillance or investigation of BLM or related groups.\r\n\t\u2022\tTraining materials or manuals used by DPS personnel in conducting such investigations.\r\n\t5.\tInteragency Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence between DPS and other law enforcement agencies (local, state, or federal) regarding the investigation or surveillance of BLM.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords of any interagency meetings or collaborations related to these investigations.\r\n\t6.\tElectronic Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, text messages, and other forms of electronic communication from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021, that include any of the following keywords: \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cBLM,\u201d \u201cBLM Houston,\u201d \u201cBLM Dallas,\u201d \u201cBLM Austin,\u201d \u201cprotest,\u201d \u201cdemonstration,\u201d \u201crally,\u201d \u201cactivist,\u201d \u201csurveillance,\u201d \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\r\n\t7.\tPrevious Request Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll records of email communications, internal memos, notes, and any other correspondence related to my previous Texas Public Information Act request (PIR# 23-1052, Tracking #2023-24018), which sought documents related to the surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter and related groups. This includes any communications between the DPS and other entities concerning the processing, handling, or response to this request.\r\n\r\nAddressing Common Exceptions:\r\nI am aware that DPS has previously cited sections 552.101 and 552.108 of the Government Code, as well as section 418.177 of the Texas Homeland Security Act (HSA), as grounds for withholding information. However, these exceptions do not universally apply to the requested information:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tSection 552.101 and 418.177: Section 418.177 pertains specifically to information related to the prevention, detection, or investigation of terrorism or related criminal activity. General law enforcement investigations that do not directly pertain to terrorism do not fall under this provision. The case Texas Department of Public Safety v. Cox Texas Newspapers, LP, 304 S.W.3d 191 (Tex. App. \u2013 Austin 2009), clarified that the public\u2019s right to transparency outweighs broad claims of confidentiality under general security concerns.\r\n\t\u2022\tSection 552.108: This section is intended to protect information related to ongoing law enforcement proceedings or internal records used for law enforcement purposes. In City of Dallas v. Abbott, 304 S.W.3d 380 (Tex. 2010), it was clarified that unless the release of information would interfere with law enforcement or prosecution, the information should be disclosed. Additionally, the peaceful nature of BLM activities typically does not warrant withholding information under this provision.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as established in Dallas Morning News v. City of Dallas, 281 S.W.3d 708 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas 2009), a government entity cannot withhold requested information unless it can demonstrate that the information falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act. Any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents must be accompanied by a specific and detailed justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the requested information is considered exempt, I request a written explanation specifying the legal grounds for each redaction or withholding, including references to the specific statutory provisions that justify the exemption.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with the Texas Public Information Act, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is for the sake of public transparency and is not for commercial purposes. Should there be any fees associated with this request, despite the waiver request, please inform me of the total charges in advance. I would prefer the request to be fulfilled electronically via email, but I am also open to receiving the information in other formats if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response within the 10 business days required by statute.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
