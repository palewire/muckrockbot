        "communication": "To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally lodge a complaint against the actions of individuals involved in the watchlist operation, which I believe have resulted in the commission of unlawful acts. It has come to my attention that certain individuals associated with the watchlist operation are engaging in tactics such as man-in-the-middle cyber attacks to obstruct, manipulate, and misrepresent communications, particularly when submitting online reports to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, Attorneys, and other Government entities. For the sake of transparency and accountability, I am submitting this complaint through Muck Rock to ensure that the public is informed of my concerns and to facilitate the proper filing and tracking of this complaint.\r\n\r\nMy involvement in this matter stems from being unjustly placed on a watchlist subsequent to my disclosure of misconduct within the Radiology Department at Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur, Missouri. I strongly believe that I obtain proof and may have witnesses that substantiates my claim.\r\n\r\nI am writing to you with regard to my 6 year wrongful inclusion in a watchlist under the jurisdiction of the Granite City Police Department and the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC). I have reason to believe that I have been subjected to various forms of abuse, harassment, and exploitation as a result of this inclusion. This grievance pertains specifically to the actions of individuals within the Saint Louis Fusion Center, as well as its collaborative partners in State, Local, Tribal, Territorial Law Enforcement (F/SLTT), Air National Guard, and private sector partners.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the Saint Louis Fusion Center and affiliates, in conjunction with programs established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as the St. Louis Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), has engaged in practices that have violated established security protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and federal laws, notably the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have been subjected to unfair treatment that includes one or more persons acting under color of law willfully depriving and conspiring to deprive me of my rights protected by the constitution. This misconduct goes beyond mere allegations of negligence commonly associated with law enforcement collaborations with Fusion Centers.\r\nI have reason to believe that certain individuals associated with the operation have inappropriately disseminated my personal information for fraudulent purposes, potentially for personal gain, thereby compromising my privacy and potentially exposing me to unwarranted harm. These actions have not only caused me distress but have also raised serious concerns regarding the integrity and legality of the operations carried out by the Saint Louis Fusion Center and its affiliates. Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the revelation that there are instances of misuse of telecommunications satellites and systems, which may pose a threat to security and integrity. I have reason to believe that these individuals have been using intelligence tactics to instill fear and create a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this operation, I have experienced instances of cruel and unusual punishment, including sexual misconduct, harassment, bodily injuries, discrimination, exploitation, mail tampering, and medical violations due to the arbitrary exercise of power. Furthermore, I have encountered Intelligence operators who have been involved in concealing, altering, and destroying evidence relevant to the situation. Additionally, these operators have intercepted telephone lines in an attempt to hinder me from reporting the illicit activities to government authorities and attorneys.\r\n\r\nAs a law-abiding citizen, I expect that my rights and privacy are protected by those tasked with upholding the law. It is disheartening to discover that I have become a victim of misconduct and negligence within a system that is meant to safeguard the well-being of its citizens.\r\n\r\nI urge your office to conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take the necessary steps to rectify any injustices that have been inflicted upon me.\r\n\r\nYour expertise and oversight in this matter are crucial to ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of our national security systems. Your prompt attention to this request is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your dedicated service and commitment to upholding the highest standards of accountability and security in our government operations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\nGranite City, Illinois 62040-2013",

Records and documents pertaining to the permits issued under the Clean Air Act for all portable and emergency generators located in or servicing cell towers in the Houston, Texas area as of May 17, 2024. The information to be provided shall include at a minimum the following:\r\n\r\na - Permit Holder Name\r\nb - Exact location (address) of generator\r\nc - Generator make, year and capacity\r\nd - First permit date issuance \r\ne- Current permit date issuance and expiration.\r\nf - Identity of carrier or customer to be serviced by generator.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or  any other format where the information sought may be stored. As you know, the Public Information Act requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest.  Targeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. \r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 15,000 subscribers and over 115,000 thousands views a month in its\r\nSubstack newsletter. Thus, it is considered a news media organization  Targeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. \r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that it has no commercial interest other than informing the public about matters of public concern. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use.\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046 or 281-772-7668. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo for Targeted Justice, Inc.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",
