        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out. This email acknowledges receipt of your attached request under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. (FOIA), by the Illinois Secretary of State's Office (ILSOS) on April 18, 2023.\r\n\r\nPer your request, we conducted a review of Illinois Secretary of State records for documents responsive to your request and determined there are responsive records that may be released.\r\n\r\nFirst, regarding ILSOS procedures on handling banned words, symbols, or ideals for custom license plates, the ILSOS has statutory authority to refuse the issuance of or revoke any plate configuration that may be questionable in nature as to its intent, pursuant to the below statute:\r\n\r\n(625 ILCS 5/3-405.2) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-405.2)\r\nSec. 3-405.2. Improper plates. The Secretary of State shall refuse to issue any license plates bearing a combination of letters or numbers, or both, which creates a potential duplication or, in the opinion of the Secretary, (1) would substantially interfere with plate identification for law enforcement purposes, (2) is misleading, or (3) creates a connotation that is offensive to good taste and decency.\r\nThe Secretary may revoke any such plates issued previously. Any person who has his or her plates revoked under this Section may acquire at no charge new plates and any required stickers of the same category and for the same period of registration.\r\n(Source: P.A. 83-449.)\r\n\r\nCitizens can submit potential offensive license plates to ILSOS for investigation via the following form found on the ILSOS website: Offensive License Plate Contact Form (ilsos.gov)<https://apps.ilsos.gov/ContactFormsWeb/offensive_plate_contact.jsp>. Following an investigation, if ILSOS finds that an issued special plate is indeed offensive, a standard letter is sent to the owner of the plate to have the plate pulled. Once the plate is pulled, ILSOS adds the offensive special plate to the ILSOS inhibit list. Attached is an example of the ILSOS letter revoking a custom plate. Please note the record contains information subject to redaction under FOIA pursuant to the following exemption:\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of the Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\r\n\r\nAlso attached is the ILSOS list of banned special license plates, known as the ILSOS inhibit list, as of 3/31/2023.\r\n\r\nFinally, please find a press release published on the ILSOS website, accessible via the following link: Secretary of State Giannoulias reveals rejected vanity plates in 2022 (ilsos.gov)<https://www.ilsos.gov/news/2023/january/230123d1.pdf>.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to have any denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor, Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd St. Springfield, Illinois, 62701, (877) 299-3642, Public.Access@ilag.gov<mailto:Public.Access@ilag.gov> (5 ILCS 140/9.5(a)). You also have the right to seek judicial review under Section 11 of the Act (5 ILCS 140/11).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJanna Spriester | Assistant General Counsel & FOIA Officer\r\nIllinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias\r\n100 W. Randolph Street, Suite 15-600\r\nChicago, IL 60601\r\n[signatureImage]\n",

Please be advised that pursuant to Section VI.C of New York City Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) Chancellor\u2019s Regulation D-110 (\u201cCR D-110\u201d), additional time is needed to respond to your request. Factors to be considered under CR D-110 in determining whether there exist circumstances necessitating more time to respond to a request may include, but are not limited to, \u201c[1] the volume of a request, [2] the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating records, [3] the complexity of the request, [4] the need to review records to determine the extent to which they must be disclosed, and [5] the number of requests received by the agency.\u201d1 \r\nWith respect to factor 2, your request requires searching multiple DOE offices. With respect to factor 4, responsive records will undergo review to ensure any records or portions thereof are exempt from disclosure. With respect to factor 5, at the time you made your request several other FOIL requests were already pending, many of which involved multiple factors or all of the factors cited above. \r\nPlease note that the list of factors is not exhaustive, and that additional extenuating circumstances apply here. Currently, additional time is also needed to process your request because offices tasked with locating, retrieving and reviewing responsive records are prioritizing matters relating to COVID-19 and are therefore experiencing increased workloads. \r\nGiven the circumstances applicable to your request, a response is expected by February 28, 2022. \r\n\r\nPlease visit FOIL-2021-040-00341 to view additional information and take any necessary action.

A blank form/submission for the school assignment request; RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. 2. Anonymized data of all school assignment requests made on behalf of CPS students with IEPs requiring placement for the 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 (to date) school years. These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. RESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. Please note that these are original requests for the applicable school year only and do not reflect revisions nor requests made for the next school year. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to this portion of your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.You may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record.The following item(s) also apply to your request:       \u2022\tApproximately [0] pages were withheld in their entirety.       \u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed.       \u2022\tOther:This completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2023-041548 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. If you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.

Homeland Security Investigations documents mentioning or describing Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets)\r\n\r\nYou may limit this request to records generated between November 1, 2018 and the present.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A copy of the 2017 Inaugural Munitions Summary and a summary of the munitions deployed on January 6, 2021 are attached.  You will note from the two documents provided that the record-keeping process has changed since the 2017 Inauguration.  Loadout and loadins are no longer conducted.  Instead, an inventory of munitions deployed are now typically conducted on a monthly basis.  Therefore, no responsive records have been located with regard to your request for a December 12, 2020 munitions loadout and loadin.\r\n\r\nPlease know that under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this response to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> .Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in this matter.\r\n\r\nTeresa Quon Hyden\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n441 Fourth Street, NW\r\n11th Floor South\r\nWashington, DC 20001",

See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur regulations require that your request must explicitly state that you will pay all fees associated with processing the request, that you will pay fees up to a specified amount, and/or that you are seeking a fee waiver.

If you wish to pursue your request, please provide fee clarification as it is unclear if you will pay fees.\r\nAccording to our regulations, if we do not receive your written response clarifying these points within 20 workdays from the date of this communication, we will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request. In such circumstances, we will not be able to comply with your request and will close our file on it.

As a reporter who plans to use the public records I have requested to publish newsworthy articles of interest to the American public, I request a fee waiver for this FOIA request. Specifically, the records that I am requesting from your agency will significantly contribute to the American public's understanding of whether and how the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is protecting the endangered Florida panther's habitat in southern Florida, including its approach to private landowners who are seeking an incident take permit in Collier County, Florida. It will also shed light on which business interests and lobbyists are influencing the agency's decision making, including the agency's administration of FOIA. The Florida panther's survival, and the general implementation of the ESA, is an issue of the utmost importance, as it pertains directly to the U.S. government's commitment to mitigating the extinction crisis that threatens wildlife around the country. As such, I request all fees in this matter be waived.\r\n\r\nI have a long track record of publishing important stories of public interests on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and intend to continue doing this work with the help of the documents your agency provides. You can find an example of my work here: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-administration-us-endangered-species-discussions-secret\r\n\r\nIf the agency denies me a fee waiver, I am willing to pay up to $50 in fees.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, please contact me at 248-763-0088.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias\r\n",

Our FOIA regulations state that bureaus will waive, or partially waive, fees if disclosure of all or part of the information is (1) In the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, and (2) Not primarily in your commercial interest. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.45(a).  Our FOIA regulations also provide four specific criteria that are used to determine whether these two requirements are met.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.48(a).  Your request meets the requirements and your fee waiver has been granted.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our response to your request, you may contact Tiffany McClurkin by email at foiar4@fws.gov<mailto:foiar4@fws.gov> or by phone at (404) 679-4104.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\nTiffany McClurkin\r\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service\r\nHeadquarters Information Resources & Technology Management\r\nAtlanta Regional Office\r\nFOIA Coordinator",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n",

CORRECTED REQUEST IS AS FOLLOWS:\r\n\r\nKENT SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nThe district responded January 3, 2023 once we reopened after the holiday the break. However, the email sent to another mail box within your agency as we have multiple requests for the same thing just different schools years.\r\n\r\nBased on the information provided, the estimated preliminary cost is $87.50 with a 10% deposit of $8.75.\r\n\r\nThe attached form will direct you to Kent School District's online payment account system. Once you make your deposit, you will receive a receipt for the payment and the district will begin processing request. Your Public Records number is 22-23-63\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n1.

Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the district, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to narrow your scope or provide additional information to help reduce the amount, please let us know.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D921CE.4F205980]<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\nTyler Inboden (She/Her)\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nSuperintendent\u2019s Office | Kent School District<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\n12033 SE 256th Street, A-100, Kent, WA 98030-6503\r\nO: (253) 373-7218 | Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us<mailto:Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us>\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

At this time, the estimated preliminary cost is $87.50 with a 10% deposit of $8.75.\r\nAs for your question regarding the records be produced in NATIVE .pst format,  the district is able to send a portion of the received record requests and correspondence in PST.

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

The Sherriff\u2019s Office provided me with the incident number 2107220284/case number 21015344 and incident number 2301220136/case number 23001556. If you have any additional case numbers or information, let me know.\r\n\r\nFirst we have to see from the law enforcement agency if we are authorized to release the audio. If we are authorized to release it, we will have your request done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by Florida State Statute Section 365.171(12)(a) and 401.30 to redact certain information from 911 calls. Section 365.171(12)(a), F.S., provides that any record, recording, or information, or portions thereof, obtained by a public agency for the purpose of providing services in an emergency which reveals the name, address, or telephone number or personal information about, or information which may identify any person requesting emergency service or reporting an emergency by accessing an emergency communications E911 system is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), F.S.  Additionally, under 401.30, records of emergency calls which contain patient examination or treatment information are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and may not be disclosed without the consent of the person to whom they pertain, but appropriate limited disclosure may be made without such consent to the person\u2019s guardian, to the next of kin if the person is deceased, or to a parent if the person is a minor.\r\n\r\nOnce your request is complete, we could email over an invoice. You could be charged for labor at a rate of $29.94 an hour if the request takes longer than 30 minutes to pull the audio. We will let you know if it reaches that point. As long as the audio is redacted, the audio file is small enough to be attached to an email and there isn't a labor charge we must receive payment for first, we can send it over email as soon as your request is complete, free of charge. If you prefer the audio be burnt onto a CD, the cost will be $0.30 for the CD and $1.76 for postage if mailed. We accept cash and checks.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa\n",

I have\r\npreviously\r\nwritten about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n100,000\r\nreaders in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\nPeople,\r\nUnicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\nexpectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\nestablished. In\r\naddition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\nthrough\r\nnon-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\nnon-profit MuckRock,\r\ndisseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\nthis, a great\r\ndeal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\ngovernment itself.\r\nAs such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\nparticular\r\nsubject in advance.\r\nFurther, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\nreleased information\r\nto a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\nInc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\nJustice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\nJustice, 19 F.\r\n3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\nbecause it also\r\nhad \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d\r\nconcerning United States\r\nforeign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\nqualify as a member of\r\nthe news media.\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\nnature of the\r\nrequester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be\r\n\u201cmade by\u201d a\r\nrepresentative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\nreporter, for\r\nexample, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\ninterest there is\r\nin the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\ndetails of the\r\nrequest itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\ncategory.\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\non it and\r\nmaking the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\nPlease select and describe in detail if you believe your request warrants\r\nexpeditious handling:\r\nPlease provide information to support your selection:\n",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, job title code, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service or classification status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI see that RI makes many of these data available here:\u00a0http://www.transparency.ri.gov/payroll/. If my request above cannot be filled, I would like to request at minimum a copy of the data available on the transparency site with a variable that denotes whether an employee is in the classified, unclassified, or non-classified service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request is governed by the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act (\u201cAPRA\u201d) contained in R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-1\u00a0et seq.\u00a0This response is solely on behalf of the Department and not any other agency or branch of government.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to age, race, gender of specific individuals, this information is exempt from disclosure.\u00a0Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-2(4)(A)(I)(b), the age, race and gender of specific state employees are not expressly defined as \u201cpublic\u201d in APRA. Therefore, in accordance with this statutory provision, the Department must determine whether disclosing this employee information tied to specific individuals \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d After consideration and balancing the interests of government transparency, the Department believes that disclosing the self-identified race, age and gender of a specific, individually named employees would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and these individuals may not want this information disclosed for personal reasons. Furthermore, disclosing this information tied to specific individuals could place these individuals at risk of identity theft and phishing attacks.\u00a0Thus, the information is exempt from disclosure.\u00a0However, in the interests of transparency, with this response, the Department is providing aggregate, de-identified information with respect to race, ethnicity, and gender for each agency.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to go back in time and create a monthly report based on past information, the Department estimates it will take approximately 4 hours for every month to pull tape and recreate the list of employees at that point in time. Therefore, based on 42 months, it will take 168 hours at a rate of $15.00 per hour making a total of $2505.00. (Note: The first hour of search and retrieval in response to an APRA request is free, and the Department may charge $15.00 per hour thereafter.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, If the Department runs the report quarterly, it will be 14 quarters at 4 hours for each quarter for a total of $825.00.\u00a0(Note: The first hour of search and retrieval in response to an APRA request is free, and the Department may charge $15.00 per hour thereafter.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, without going back in time, the Department is able to provide a spreadsheet of current employees with the following columns name, title, department, annual salary, classified/unclassified/non-classified status at no charge.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-4(b) and 220-RICR-50-05-1.6(B) of the Department\u2019s APRA Regulations, the first hour of search and retrieval in response to an APRA request is free, and the Department may charge $15.00 per hour thereafter. The Department has provided estimates for both monthly and quarterly reports. Therefore, the estimated cost must be prepaid before the Department proceeds with your request as follows:\u00a0Please make check or money order for prepayment payable to \u201cRhode Island General Fund\u201d and send or deliver the payment to the attention of Division of Legal Services, One Capitol Hill, 4th Floor, Providence, RI 02908, with specific reference to your request.\u00a0Please note time will be tolled under APRA until payment is made.

I am writing in response to your determination on April 11, 2023, stating that the Locust Valley Central School District does not maintain or possess the records I requested in my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request dated March 5, 2023.\r\n\r\nBased on the disclosure documents published on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) website, it appears that the District does, in fact, produce enrollment projections and attests to these projections in multiple instances. Specifically, on page A-2 (page 20 in the PDF) of the document found at the following link: https://emma.msrb.org/P11520405.pdf\r\n\r\nGiven this information, I kindly request that you reconsider and reevaluate my original FOIL request for the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Live Birth Data including constant birth rate, long term, short term, and average birth rates for within the district for the current and previous six years.\r\n2. Birth to Kindergarten Survival Ratio used for the past ten years by year.\r\n3. Projected Kindergarten Enrollment for the past ten years by year, and supporting data.\r\n4. Any communications with NYS DOH or County DOH or other data service provider requesting, receiving, or inquiring regarding live birth data, birth to kindergarten survival rate, or other statistical data used for projecting enrollment.\r\n5. Copies of all enrollment projections for the past six years and source statistical data, including but not limited to live birth data which were used to provide projected enrollment data upon which securities purchasers rely.\r\n\r\nIf the District does not maintain these specific records, I kindly request that you provide any alternative records or information that may help fulfill my request, such as the departments or agencies that might maintain such records.",

I have been producing, on behalf of the District, public records request logs, which are \u201celectronic cop[ies]\u201d of \u201cPublic Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d I understood the logs to be directly responsive to the first part of your request.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  If you do not believe public records request logs are responsive to your request, please clarify your request to explain what records you intended to request by seeking \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d\r\n  2.  As you likely know, Washington law does not require agencies to retain records relating to public requests records beyond two years after the request is closed. The Local Government Common Records Retention Schedule, section 5.4, sets forth records that may be destroyed after two years, which \u201c[i]ncludes but is not limited to:\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInternal and external correspondence relating to the request;\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records provided to the requestor (copies or lists of the records provided, etc.);\u201d and\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records (or portions) withheld (exemption logs, copies of portions redacted, etc.).\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, many such records relating to requests closed more than 2 years prior to the date of your request no longer exist. That is also why I was producing request logs to you. For many of the older requests, the request logs may be the only existing records. Do you no longer want to receive request logs, even if they may be the only existing records potentially responsive to your request with respect to requests closed more than two years prior to the date of your request?\r\n\r\n  1.  I was also producing request logs to give you an opportunity to identify particular requests that were of interest to you, so searches for records relating to those requests could be prioritized. Is that an opportunity that is of interest to you?\r\n\r\nYour answers to these clarification questions are due within 30 days, that is, on or before August 12. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s next response. The District will not proceed with the next installment scheduled for July 20, pending receipt of your answers, so that the District\u2019s responses can reflect an accurate understanding of what you are requesting. If you do not answer within 30 days, your request may be closed.\r\n\r\nThe District is under no obligation to produce records to you in a reverse chronological order. Records will be produced in a manner that reflects the most efficient method of assembling and reviewing potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Therefore, appended hereto please find:\r\n\r\n2019 Log\r\n\r\nThis record contains information that is exempt under the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56.RCW. Redactions made pursuant to the Act are marked with an overlying code. I have also attached a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that provides an explanation of the basis for the exemptions applied. If no code is applied or if a code is partially visible, the applicable codes are 1A, 10A.\r\n\r\nI regret that it was not possible to make an installment of records to you on the previously estimated date of August 3, 2022. The factors affecting the extension of that date included staff absences due to illness and vacation break, and ongoing workload in this department.\r\nAs I indicated to you in response to your request PRR 11022021-Anon, the District is not withholding any records from you and has nothing to hide.\r\nPlease direct all messages pertaining to your request to the public records mailbox, publicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>.\r\nThe automated correspondence features of the Muckrock site are not an efficient way to correspond or to review correspondence. Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string, or by excerpting them in any way. I know that the correspondence history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that a complete and accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nI estimate a next installment to your request will be made on or before September 26, 2022. Estimated dates are subject to change. The timing of this estimate is based on anticipated staff absences, operational responsibilities related to school reopening, and the workload in this department.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6).

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).
