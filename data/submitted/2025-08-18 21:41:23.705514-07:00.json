        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any records pertaining to a patrol between August 11-15, 2025, at Lamont St. NW and Mt. Pleasant St. SW, in Washington, D.C., which is depicted in these videos: https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r and https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828.\r\n\r\n2. Any photographs, audio, or video captured by the law enforcement officials or employees during the above-mentioned patrol. This includes all raw and unedited video recorded by the device used to record this video (https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) on the date that video (i.e., https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) was recorded.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the federal government's removal of a banner in a public park during a patrol of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest, as exemplified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's decision to publicize the video on its official social media account and by news coverage of the event.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/mount-pleasant-ice-immigration-federal-takeover-trump-donald-dc-washington/65-b6bfbde6-030d-41e7-8c46-4f0b96944a3a\r\nb. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/ice-immigration-dc-washington-mount-pleasant/65-d3517d58-d9e1-4f47-974b-e8ad4575a4d4\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement officers with the approval of officials at the Department of Homeland Security and/or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Any and all records regarding the below April 2019 article published by WGRZ Ch. 2 News Buffalo regarding the 'suspicious' package dropped off at the Rath Building. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wgrz.com/article/news/brother-and-sister-believe-package-that-caused-concern-for-poloncarz-came-from-them/71-df54a2b2-c826-4ca1-8634-64fdd6bd1c2d\r\n\r\nIn early April 2019, a brother and sister came forward believing that a suspicious package delivered to Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz\u2019s office in mid-March may have originated from them. The package, addressed personally and marked \u201curgent\u201d without a return address, triggered alarm at the office and ultimately led Poloncarz to adopt an armed security detail. The sibling duo\u2014Christina Little and Kevin Riford\u2014say the envelope contained extensive documentation concerning a contentious custody dispute and allegations of judicial corruption in Niagara County. They hoped Poloncarz would either take action or forward their concerns to Governor Cuomo. After passing routine security screening, the package was delivered to a receptionist on the 16th floor of the Rath Building, along with similar documents sent to local media outlets.  Shortly afterward, a sheriff\u2019s investigator visited Christina\u2019s home seeking Kevin.

Any and all records regarding the below\r\nApril 2019 article published by WGRZ Ch. 2 News Buffalo regarding the\r\n'suspicious' package dropped off at the Rath Building.\r\nhttps://www.wgrz.com/article/news/brother-and-sister-believe-package-that-\r\ncaused-concern-for-poloncarz-came-from-\r\nthem/71-df54a2b2-c826-4ca1-8634-64fdd6bd1c2d In early April 2019, a brother\r\nand sister came forward believing that a suspicious package delivered to Erie\r\nCounty Executive Mark Poloncarz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in mid-March may have originated from\r\nthem. The package, addressed personally and marked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd without a return\r\naddress, triggered alarm at the office and ultimately led Poloncarz to adopt\r\nan armed security detail. The sibling duo\u00e2\u20ac\u201dChristina Little and Kevin\r\nRiford\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsay the envelope contained extensive documentation concerning a\r\ncontentious custody dispute and allegations of judicial corruption in Niagara\r\nCounty. They hoped Poloncarz would either take action or forward their\r\nconcerns to Governor Cuomo. After passing routine security screening, the\r\npackage was delivered to a receptionist on the 16th floor of the Rath\r\nBuilding, along with similar documents sent to local media outlets. Shortly\r\nafterward, a sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigator visited Christina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home seeking Kevin.\r\nThe siblings were confused by the level of concern raised over what appeared\r\nto them to be harmless legal documents. Poloncarz later confirmed the package\r\nplayed a part in increasing security measures, though he did not personally\r\nread the contents\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis staff reviewed it after authorities cleared it as non-\r\ndangerous The requested documents will be made available to the general\r\npublic, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the\r\nevent that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the\r\ntotal charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request\r\nfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Hello --\r\n\r\nThis is an amendment to my request and a request for expedited processing.\r\n\r\nFirst, please amend the request to seek:\r\n\r\n1. Any records pertaining to a patrol between August 11-15, 2025, at Lamont St. NW and Mt. Pleasant St. SW, in Washington, D.C., which is depicted in these videos: https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r and https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828.\r\n\r\n2. Any photographs, audio, or video captured by the law enforcement officials or employees during the above-mentioned patrol. This includes all raw and unedited video recorded by the device used to record this video (https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) on the date that video (i.e., https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) was recorded.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the federal government's removal of a banner in a public park during a patrol of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest, as exemplified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's decision to publicize the video on its official social media account and by news coverage of the event.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/mount-pleasant-ice-immigration-federal-takeover-trump-donald-dc-washington/65-b6bfbde6-030d-41e7-8c46-4f0b96944a3a\r\nb. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/ice-immigration-dc-washington-mount-pleasant/65-d3517d58-d9e1-4f47-974b-e8ad4575a4d4\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement officers with the approval of officials at the Department of Homeland Security and/or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Pleasant St. SW. \n\nYour request was received in this office on 8/15/2025. \n\nAfter careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking. \n\nBased on the video link you provided, we are unable to determine what DHS component officers were at that location. Please provide more information. \n\nRecords must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \n\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components.  Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions.  A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online:  https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information.  If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office.  Otherwise, respond back with your additional information. \n\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

those are records that are not legally privileged. \r\n\r\nPlease also note that the publication of https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/14/2025-15490/notice-of-the-department-of-energy-freedom-of-information-act-foia-still-interested-inquiry makes both items 2 & 3 post-decisional, and that they include \"facts\", which are exempt from deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction format \r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content, please assign a replacement identifier for each different piece of content redacted, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the DoE has incorporated these records, by reference, in a Federal Register publication, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/14/2025-15490/notice-of-the-department-of-energy-freedom-of-information-act-foia-still-interested-inquiry; \r\n* these records would inform the public about a novel attempt to cancel FOIA requests in bulk; and\r\n* these records would better enable responses to the DoE's Federal Register publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Expedition\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing, to be completed in no longer than 2 weeks, because these records are critical to \r\na. informing responses to the DoE's Federal Register publication, which demands a response by September 18, 2025, and\r\nb. informing timely journalistic coverage of that publication and its likely impact.\r\n\r\nI also note that all records requested by item 1 should be already held by the DoE HQ FOIA office itself, making it especially easy to quicky provide.\r\n\r\nPlease pay particular attention to the \"rolling updates\" request above. In order to maximally expedite this request, please provide every record (or part of record) requested as soon as you are able, on the same day as that particular record can be provided, without waiting for any remaining records requested, even if that makes the records fragmented, or makes any particular update incomplete. This includes, for example, providing CSV formatted spreadsheets in response to item 1 which cover only some of the sub-items (if for instance some of them can be more quickly provided than others). However, please ensure that every spreadsheet provided in response to item 1 includes at least 1 uniquely identifying field-set which is the same across all spreadsheets, so that partial responses can be easily combined to form a single updated spreadsheet. (Alternatively and preferably, provide successively updated spreadsheets with all information available so far, rather than just the unique identifiers and the newly available column(s).)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires for expedited requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is \"Sai\". Please use no title for me.",
