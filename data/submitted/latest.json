His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find a New York Times report on his death at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

I am an assistant editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

I'm specifically looking for investigative files related to the cases, and any other documents that are considered public -- and particularly those that were not previously released.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please search HQ records as well as ALL field offices and resident agencies.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, and am currently a reporter of The Boston Globe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nCourt documents show that the FBI has an at least 16-page report concerning the attempted bribery of former Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced by Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 and Puerto Rican Elected Official 2. The court document alleges \"Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 aimed to negotiate with V\u00e1zquez, recognizing that if Pierluisi\u2019sappointment failed, she would be positioned to become governor.\" The court document also alleges that \"V\u00e1zquez agreed to assist the FBI, starting by recording a conversation with , a Department of Justice contractor (\u201cContractor 1\u201d), who had been approached by , Puerto Rican Elected Official 1\u2019s cousin and a convicted felon, about arranging a meeting between V\u00e1zquez and Puerto Rican Elected Official 1 regarding the governorship.\" The document continues by saying that \"under the FBI's guidance, V\u00e1zquez recorded several conversations.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the document, the FBI closed the investigation in November 2019, citing difficulties in arranging meetings with V\u00e1zquez after she became governor. I have attached the document in its entirety to this communication.You can find the document here: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64868850/677/united-states-v-vazquez-garced/\r\n\r\nA news report revealed that Elected Official 1 and Elected Official 2 are former Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n. You can find the news report here: https://www.noticel.com/tribunales/ahora/top-stories/20240927/wanda-vazquez-grabo-a-rivera-schatz-y-a-gonzalez-colon-alegando-soborno-ante-fbi/\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following documents:\r\n\r\n1) The at least 16-page FBI report mentioned in both the court document and the news report in its entirety that mention an alleged \"\u201ca conspiracy between [Puerto Rican Elected Official 1] and [Puerto Rican Elected Official 2] of their intention of removing the [Governor V\u00e1zquez] so either [Puerto Rican Elected Official 1] or [Puerto Rican Elected Official 2] can become the governor.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is for all records produced between January 1, 2019 and the time this request is processed.  In the event there are multiple records, please send them to me on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nPlease do a search of main file records alongside cross-reference records and an ELSUR (electronic surveillance) records. Additionally, please search the Sentinel database, the Investigative Data Warehouse, and the Data Integration and Visualization System.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request expedited processing for this FOIA request because of significant public interest and urgency. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, one of the people reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is currently Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner and is running for Governor of Puerto Rico under the New Progressive Party. Similarly, Thomas Rivera Schatz, another person reportedly mentioned in the FBI report, is running for the Senate of Puerto Rico. The FBI report could have pertinent information relating to both of their campaigns, a highly relevant topic given the approaching November 5 election. Access to this information is crucial for informing the public about potential implications for governance and policy direction. \r\n\r\nAs a journalist, timely access to this information will enable me to report on critical issues affecting the electorate, ensuring that voters have the necessary context as they prepare to make informed decisions. Delays in obtaining this information could impede public understanding and discourse surrounding the election, which is a matter of public concern. Delaying access to this information could hinder public understanding of and trust in the electoral process and the candidates involved, which are essential for an informed electorate. The information in the document is time-sensitive  given the November 5 election, which is less than 50 days away. There is significant public interest in the information within this report, given its relevance to current events and both politician's run for elected positions, which will impact voters and Puerto Rico public policy.\r\n\r\nIf any part of this request is denied, I would appreciate a detailed explanation for the denial, including the specific exemptions being claimed. Additionally, I would be grateful for your assistance in identifying any related documents that may exist.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am a freelance journalist recognized by multiple journalists associations who has worked for multiple local, state, and international publications. Any information gathered from this request will be used in reporting about politicians in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Any/all emails sent to the Kent School District Board of Directors email address: kentboardmembers@kent.k12.wa.us\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE FOR THIS REQUEST\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 2024 - September 27, 2024\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v.

We schedule visits no more than three months in advance. Research room hours will be Monday-Friday, 9:00am-5:00pm. Please visit https://www.archives.gov/college-park for a link to our Eventbrite page to schedule a research appointment. \r\n\r\nOne cart of records may be pulled in advance if accurate and complete information is provided when a research appointment is scheduled. Please provide visit_archives2@nara.gov with the citations for the records you would like to view -- including Record Group #, Entry #, Series Title, and Container #(s) -- when confirming your appointment. Please note that due to the high demand of ad hoc (day-of) pulls, advance pulls are not guaranteed. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you schedule a virtual consultation prior to scheduling a research appointment, particularly if you do not know the specific boxes you would like to request; working with a reference consultant will help you better prepare for your visit.
