        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Department of State (DOS) records, documents, and communications responsive to Project Brain Wave, aka Operation Brain Wave. This was a program proposed and implemented by the DOS between 1950 and 1955. An undated memorandum sent by someone within the DOS to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council states: \"10. 'Project Brain Wave'. The Department of State is developing and has reported to the Board a project designed to stimulate display of indigenous anti-Communist sentiment in the countries of Western Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorandum is number 57 in a group of memos declassified by the DOS and can be found on page 109 of a document made accessible at: https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/96783.pdf.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorandum was sent, someone associated with the Office of International Information and Educational Exchange Programs, Bureau of Public Affairs sent or received an undated draft memorandum, written at some point between January 1, 1951 and December 31, 1952, titled \"Implementation of Operation Brain Wave\".  This document, attached, states as follows: \"I recommend that steps be taken to form a private foundation or organization with an appropriate title, which would in effect be usable as a direct arm of the State Department, which could be used to channel ideas to, and which would on its own initiative promote projects consistent with our objectives in a given country; an organization so eminently respectable that, in the conduct of projects, even though supported financially by the Department of State, the hand of the Department need not appear at all. Such organization could recruit and send people to Europe for example to get Operation Brain Wave underway.\"\r\n\r\nThis draft memorandum can be found at the National Archives and Record Administration, Archives II, College Park, Maryland, and its catalog information can be found at: https://catalog.archives.gov/id/3857396.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Information about Project/Operation Brain Wave has been declassified previously, as shown in the two examples provided above, and additional information about this program might help clarify the role of the DOS in managing tensions during the Cold War. The attached draft memo which references the creation of a \"private foundation or organization\" later identifies this entity as a \"front organization.\" During the Cold War, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established such an organization, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, and it carried out many of the same functions described in the draft memo. Clarifying any overlap between DOS and CIA activities can help historians, journalists, and lay scholars in better contextualizing the Cold War for the public.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and psychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988. During this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he used this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson. Mr. Hurkos was himself arrested by the FBI on February 9, 1964, for impersonation of an FBI agent; he was found guilty and fined $1,000.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Hurkos's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to CONBRIBE (58-5205). \r\n\r\nAt least two prior requests have been made for these records: on July 11, 2011, the FBI opened FOIPA request number 1169380-000, for \"CONBRIBE (1963 & PRIOR)\",  and on August 22, 2020, it opened FOIPA request number 1292493-000, for \"CONBRIBE - Nationalities Intelligence\". The CONBRIBE records deal with Congressional bribery investigations handled by the FBI. CONBRIBE was assigned a Bureau file number of 58-5205.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media.

In addition to the prior FOIPA requests, which demonstrate a continuing public interest in the subject, the CONBRIBE records involve investigations into public corruption targeting members of Congress by foreign agents. These investigations, and their outcomes, would contribute greatly to public understanding of how, historically, the FBI has handled investigations into public officials, especially with regard to the involvement of foreign nations and their agents, along with providing insight into attempts by foreign nationals to influence American officials. There should be no concerns for public privacy or ongoing investigations, as most, if not all of the subjects are now deceased; CONBRIBE investigations occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100.

Mr. Parris, who went by numerous aliases and pseudonyms including \"Professor de Herbert\" and \"Professor Uriah Konje\" was a Barbadian-born, Harlem-based writer of mystic numerology. Born in 1893, died in 1973. \r\n\r\nIn May of 2022, \"The Success Dream Book\" was banned from distribution to the prison population of the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York State. \r\n\r\nParris published numerous books including \r\nThe H.P. Dream Book (as Professor Uriah Konje)\r\nThe Combination Dream Book \r\nThe Lucky Star Dream Book\r\n\r\nThe publication of these materials made Parris an exceptionally wealthy Afro-Caribbean in New York by the late 1930s. Parris pontificated in his writings about the Ku Klux Klan and Marcus Garvey. According to information online, Parris hired FBI informant HERBERT S. BOULIN as an employee. There is likely to be agency documentation related to Parris in files related to: the Ku Klux Klan, Marcus Garvey, Herbert S. Boulin. \r\n\r\nMore information about Herbert Gladstone Parris and his affiliation with FBI information Herbert S. Boulin can be found here: https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/67/vandegrift.php\r\nMore information about his birth and death can be found here: https://www.luckymojo.com/professorkonje.html\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Herbert Gladstone Parris from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Herbert Gladstone Parris held by the New York, Philadelphia or Washington field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Herbert Gladstone Parris. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases (\"Professor de Herbert\"), nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms (\"Professor Uriah Konje\") or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Herbert Gladstone Parris. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Herbert Gladstone Parris. \r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together on this request, no matter how long it takes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request includes records addressing allegations of systemic constitutional violations, ADA non-compliance, whistleblower retaliation, and associated governance issues.\r\n\r\nScope of Request\r\nComplaint Review and Processing:\r\n\r\nAll internal records, including memos, emails, meeting notes, decision logs, and evaluations, documenting the review and disposition of complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nAny workflows or internal task assignments related to this complaint, including timelines and responsible personnel.\r\nExternal and Interagency Communications:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence between DOJ and external entities, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Connecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office, and other federal or state agencies concerning the subject matter of the complaint.\r\nInteragency directives or advisories relating to oversight or collaboration on systemic issues identified in the complaint.\r\nPolicy, Procedure, and Action Records:\r\n\r\nDocumentation of DOJ protocols, policies, or operational guidelines used in assessing, addressing, or dismissing complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nRecords of enforcement actions, case follow-ups, or formal referrals stemming from the complaint.\r\nPersonnel Involvement:\r\n\r\nIdentification of all DOJ personnel involved in processing or overseeing this matter, including their roles, decision-making authority, and communication logs.\r\nLegal and Procedural Basis:\r\n\r\nAny legal analyses, internal opinions, or statutory references justifying the decision communicated to me in your letter dated December 2, 2024, indicating no further action would be taken.\r\nSupporting documentation outlining the DOJ's compliance with whistleblower protection standards, ADA obligations, and constitutional governance in this decision.\r\nADA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nAll DOJ records, policies, and communications addressing ADA accommodations or whistleblower protections as applied in this case.\r\nDocumentation of any DOJ awareness, training, or application of ADA-compliant processes related to this complaint.\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the significant public interest in transparency regarding whistleblower retaliation, ADA compliance, and constitutional violations, expedited processing is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E).

This request includes records addressing allegations of systemic constitutional violations, ADA non-compliance, whistleblower retaliation, and associated governance issues.\r\n\r\nScope of Request\r\nComplaint Review and Processing:\r\n\r\nAll internal records, including memos, emails, meeting notes, decision logs, and evaluations, documenting the review and disposition of complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nAny workflows or internal task assignments related to this complaint, including timelines and responsible personnel.\r\nExternal and Interagency Communications:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence between DOJ and external entities, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Connecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office, and other federal or state agencies concerning the subject matter of the complaint.\r\nInteragency directives or advisories relating to oversight or collaboration on systemic issues identified in the complaint.\r\nPolicy, Procedure, and Action Records:\r\n\r\nDocumentation of DOJ protocols, policies, or operational guidelines used in assessing, addressing, or dismissing complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nRecords of enforcement actions, case follow-ups, or formal referrals stemming from the complaint.\r\nPersonnel Involvement:\r\n\r\nIdentification of all DOJ personnel involved in processing or overseeing this matter, including their roles, decision-making authority, and communication logs.\r\nLegal and Procedural Basis:\r\n\r\nAny legal analyses, internal opinions, or statutory references justifying the decision communicated to me in your letter dated December 2, 2024, indicating no further action would be taken.\r\nSupporting documentation outlining the DOJ's compliance with whistleblower protection standards, ADA obligations, and constitutional governance in this decision.\r\nADA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nAll DOJ records, policies, and communications addressing ADA accommodations or whistleblower protections as applied in this case.\r\nDocumentation of any DOJ awareness, training, or application of ADA-compliant processes related to this complaint.\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the significant public interest in transparency regarding whistleblower retaliation, ADA compliance, and constitutional violations, expedited processing is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Immediate access to these records is essential to addressing ongoing harm and systemic governance issues.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nAs this request is made in the public interest and not for commercial purposes, I request a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).
