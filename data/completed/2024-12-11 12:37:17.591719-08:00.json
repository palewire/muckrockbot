FBI, 633 F. Supp. 336 (C.D. Cal. 1986), regarding the limits of Glomar responses.\r\nCiting Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), and Department of Defense v.

Cir. 2013), which clarifies the limits of Glomar responses following public acknowledgment.\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nEnclosed is a Fee Waiver Request [attach Fee_Waiver_Letter.pdf], as the information sought is for public knowledge and understanding, and not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nResponse Expectations:\r\nA timely response within the 20-working-day statutory period as outlined in FOIA is expected. In the event of any denial or partial fulfillment, a detailed justification referencing specific FOIA exemptions is required.\r\n\r\nLegal Preparedness:\r\nThis request is structured for use in potential legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the FOIA.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Kinda, yeah, but not exactly.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting you run the search again but only with that parameter returning larger files, with the intent of seeing how many files are of the kind that might fit the \"1 GB of data can contain anywhere from 16,000 individual pages to over 60,000 pages\" estimate. Using size:1048568..1074000000 returns all the results that are between about a megabyte and a gigabyte. I'm making an educated guess that a very small number of files are responsible for the majority of the on disk space.\r\n\r\nI suspect that some files are very large on disk (like powerpoints with uncompressed images), but have very few pages that need to be reviewed. As an example, a scientist colleague of mine once had a powerpoint presentation that was more than a gigabyte in size, with something like only 50 slides. She'd included some videos that had never been compressed, which drastically inflated the file size.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly what features the city pays for (the licensing agreement with Microsoft is the subject of another ongoing FOIL request of mine!), but one possible option is you may be able to export a report to see more information about the documents the search returns:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-export-a-content-search-report\r\n\r\nAn alternative that I provided was to simply download a copy of the larger search results and spot check them to see if there are just a few files that account for the majority of the on-disk space. That's very easy with some common free software, but if you wish to do it manually, increasing the parameter to something like size:52430000..1074000000 should reduce the volume of files even further.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that using size:1048568..1074000000 might return several hundred files, and size:52430000..1074000000 might return a few dozen. If you run the 50 MB-1GB search and the size of the responsive records are like 10GB, that means we've found the culprit! And I can ask you to either review the number of pages in that files when estimating the voluminousness of the request as a whole. If it's just a few powerpoints, neither of us have to worry about days  spent redacting 16,000 pages, it may only be a hundred.",

Will the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency be met?\r\n\r\nI would like to assume the agency is being forthright with me about meeting a date they propose, and have no knowledge of anything that they might be able to reasonably foresee preventing them from producing the requested and agreed upon records. I struggle to fathom how a pre-existing and ongoing backlog could surprise anybody by causing delays in records production - some agencies have abused this with me in a downright rude manner to delay requests more than a dozen times. \r\n\r\nI have no personal animus with any individual employed by the department - in a likely understaffed role - who is following routine agency procedures, and I presume they have no issue with me. We're all working with unfair systems run by people we have no contact with! Indeed, the records access officer I dealt with earlier was exceptionally helpful and more technically competent than the majority of records access officers that I've interacted with.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have learned that such agency-proposed records production dates are more often missed than met, and it's no more likely the agency will meet the next date they propose than the one they've missed. On muckrock, this agency is a bit better than the average NYC agency, and returns records with an average of 113 days, so we're just on the edge of meeting this date! That's good news - I just want to rely on something better than crossed fingers.\r\n\r\nI am pre-emptively appealing on grounds of constructive denial of records. I am asking the agency to provide guarantees that the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency will be met, and if it cannot be met under current circumstances, that the agency shall either provide a date for which they will provide such records absent circumstances a reasonable person cannot reasonably forsee delaying production of records, or assign sufficient staff to meet the agency proposed records production date. \r\n\r\nI look forward to this appeal being moot upon production of records by the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date.",

DDS enables the secure delivery of files, documents and other electronic information while providing tracking and reporting capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDDS secure file transfer involves three simple steps:\r\n\r\n1.   Create a package of files and deliver it to a pre-approved external email address.\r\n\r\n2.   Recipients are notified of their secure delivery in an email message.\r\n\r\n(Recipients must have an account in this system otherwise they will not be able to get files)\r\n\r\n3.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm. Incident number or other unique identifier for each arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nn. Offender number or other unique identifier for each individual arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until\r\n\r\nthe day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D. Research Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration k.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n617-373-5862\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front (NWLF). The NWLF was a radical left-wing terrorist group that formed on or around November 23, 1973, with the bombing of a Pacific Gas and Electric utility substation in Cupertino, California. Over the next six years, the NWLF was credited with bombings throughout the United States; one instance, in 1976, involved members of the organization placing an explosive device on a windowsill at the home of then-San Francisco Supervisor (and later United States Senator) Dianne Feinstein. NWLF membership overlapped with another organization the FBI monitored in this same period: the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). SLA members Bill and Emily Harris claimed membership in the NWLF at the time of their arrests, in 1975.\r\n\r\nThe FBI, at various points during the 1970s, identified the NWLF as a subject of interest in ongoing investigations. Page six of a memorandum located in the FBI's HEARNAP records (dated October 11, 1974; HEARNAP Part 21, page 41) contains what appears to be a Bureau file number for the NWLF at its Los Angeles Field Office: \"LOS ANGELES IS CONDUCTING INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE CASE CAPTIONED 'UNSUB; BOMBING OF SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL, 9750 AIRPORT BOULEVARD, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, OCTOBER 5, 1974' EID - NEW WORLD LIBERATION FRONT, 00: LOS ANGELES, LOS ANGELES FILE 174-2103.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a September 7, 1978 bulletin created by the FBI Terrorism Research Center outlined a detailed history and methodology of the NWLF, stating, in part: \"[I]ncidents, over 70,  have ... occurred in Seattle, Washington; Rainier, Oregon; and Aurora, Colorado. Victims of NWLF attacks have included Federal, state and local governmental functions, diplomatic establishments, corporate facilities, and public utilities. Communiques claiming responsibility for the incidents state the actions were staged to protest against governmental policies and the intervention of the U.S. corporations into the internal affairs of foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nBoth items indicate that the FBI created HQ and field office files for the NWLF in the course of investigations into terrorist attacks carried out by the organization. Therefore, I am requesting copies of all FBI records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front, aka the NWLF.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of investigations into left-wing terrorism. The FBI has already made public records related to the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst in its HEARNAP collection. Contained in these records are numerous references to then NWLF, yet the FBI has not released any records on this group. Contemporaneous and postmortem accounts of the NWLF identify that Ms. Hearst interacted with NWLF members before her capture, thus the release of all NWLF records would contribute significantly to public understanding of the FBI's handling of the HEARNAP case.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the NWLF carried out attacks on public officials and public services for almost a decade. Understanding how the FBI responded to these attacks is a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nWe do not have access to Class Dojo as it isn't something we own or manage.

This email is of particular interest, and as Rowen's parent under FERPA and given these are also public records, I would appreciate receiving these communications electronically.\r\nIf electronic delivery of all responsive records presents any technical challenges, I would be happy to receive them in batches, starting with the March 2024 communications.\r\nI understand there were system issues due to power outages affecting older records, but the March 2024 communications should not be affected by those winter break outages.\r\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information from me to process this request for electronic delivery.\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "Given your role in the Office of Legal Services, I\u2019m seeking clarification regarding district policy on recommending school-based counseling for a student who, according to official school records, displays no behavioral or academic concerns in school and is described as a role model to her peers.\r\n\r\nAs a parent, I am curious about how such a recommendation aligns with district procedures, particularly in a Title 1 school setting where resources are often allocated based on immediate, school-related needs. Specifically, I\u2019d appreciate insight into:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tDistrict Procedures and Resource Allocation: What is the district\u2019s stance on using Title 1 resources, like school-based counseling, for students who do not display in-school issues? How is this type of intervention typically justified and documented in such cases?\r\n\t2.  Compliance and Liability: Could recommending school-based counseling under these circumstances pose any compliance or liability concerns for the district, particularly if the recommendation is based on observations outside of the school environment?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in clarifying the district\u2019s policy on these matters. I look forward to your guidance on how this aligns with established procedures and legal obligations.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichael Locke\r\n",

While the note reflects the meeting date of March 7, 2024, it does not indicate the date and time when the note was actually created or entered into the school\u2019s record-keeping system.\r\n\r\nI was informed of this meeting only after it had occurred and subsequently spoke with Ms. Tubbs (now Mrs. Woltman) via ClassDojo. In that conversation, I expressed my views on the subjects discussed during the meeting; however, these views were not reflected in the conference note. To ensure complete transparency and accuracy in my child\u2019s educational records, I am requesting the following under FERPA:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInitial Entry Date and Time: Documentation or metadata showing when the March 7, 2024, conference note was first entered or saved in your electronic records system.\r\n\t2.\tAudit Trail: An audit log or record of access, including any modifications, views, or retrievals of this document, along with the associated dates and times. This information will help verify when and by whom the document has been accessed or modified within the school\u2019s system.\r\n\t3.\tExplanation of Record Creation Process: Any policies or procedures relating to how records like conference notes are entered, saved, and generated from your system, specifically addressing any delays between the meeting date and the creation date of the document.\r\n\r\nAs a parent with rights to review and access my child\u2019s educational records under FERPA, I am seeking this information to verify the accuracy and integrity of the documentation in Rowen\u2019s records. I would appreciate a prompt response within the time frame required under FERPA regulations, and I am open to receiving these records in electronic format via email.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees associated with providing these records, please inform me in advance. Should you require further clarification or additional information to process this request, feel free to contact me at the phone number or email address provided above.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\r\n",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link. Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks-simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into small, medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track extra-small requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days, medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the [complex] request [large] processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is [September, 2026].  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

All IHSC or ERO SENs and SIRs relating to medical issues at the Aurora ICE Processing Center just outside Denver, Colorado, created between April 2022 and the present (which, under applicable FOIA law, means \u2018the date on which the agency tasks an adequate search\u2019). \r\n\r\n3.

On October 14, 2022, ICE announced the death of a 39 year-old man inside Aurora ICE Processing Center. \r\nB. ICE subsequently posted a Detainee Death Report describing his medical treatment and care at Aurora. \r\nC. In the wake of his death, significant questions have arisen as to the safety and appropriateness of the medical services he received in the weeks preceding it. \r\nD. These concerns directly impact humans currently imprisoned inside AIPC, and the medical system serving it. \r\nE. Failure to obtain timely, comprehensive information on IHSC and ICE\u2019s capacity to ensure timely and appropriate medical care may put the health and safety of people inside at further risk. \r\nF. The case has been the subject of widespread media attention, and Congressional demands for preservation of records and a thorough, independent investigation. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we respectfully request expedited processing of this request. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

You have requested All Significant Event Notifications (SENs) and Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) created by ERO Field Office detention staff or Immigrant ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) staff and transmitted to IHSC\u2019s Medical Quality Management Unit or other custodians responsible for monitoring the quality and timeliness of detained immigrants care in custody, between January 1, 2021, and the present, that satisfy all of the following criteria: (a) Detainee - Involves a detained immigrant in any U.S. ICE facility; (b) Needing Care \u2014 Who required emergent care, chronic care, or a referral for a higher level of care; (c) Based on DVT or PE or Clot \u2014 For one or more of the following conditions, whether a formal diagnosis exists or not: (i) deep vein thrombophlebitis (DVT); (ii) pulmonary thromboembelism; _or_ (iii) blood clot. \r\n\r\n2. All IHSC or ERO SENs and SIRs relating to medical issues at the Aurora ICE Processing Center just outside Denver, Colorado, created between April 2022 and the present (which, under applicable FOIA law, means \u2018the date on which the agency tasks an adequate search\u2019). \r\n\r\n3. Any record showing the number of chronic care patients, special medical needs, or significant detainee illness patients IHSC Headquarters or the IHSC Regional Health Services Administrator was aware of on the morning of October 12, 2022. We will accept a total number in lieu of a redacted list.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request produced 65 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 59 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAngela Flores \r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009 \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\t65 Pages \r\nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.",

        "communication": "Dera Ms. Feldman:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your October 24 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) request for records related to package theft trends across major U.S. metropolitan areas. Specially, your requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Statistics on reported package thefts from Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Denver and Portland between January 1, 2019, and the present.\r\n  2.  Policies and protocols for investigating package theft involving USPS deliveries.\r\n  3.  Communication or agreements between the USPS Postal Inspection Service and local police departments regarding theft investigations and prevention.\r\n  4.  Public outreach materials or initiatives addressing package theft prevention.\r\n\r\nThe OIG FOIA case number shown in the subject line above has been assigned to your request. Your request will be processed in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides agencies 20 working days from receipt to respond to requesters. While this office routinely meets this requirement, current workloads may require additional time to provide our final response.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA is about records we have in our possession. The FOIA provides only for disclosing federal agency records and does not require government agencies to answer questions, conduct unreasonably burdensome research, or create records. FOIA does not let you appeal any investigative decisions or ask us to research aside from searching for responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The FOIA provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, unless such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgment is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and employment/personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the law enforcement, crime prevention, and security arm of USPS, and is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Additional information regarding the USPIS FOIA program can be found at Terms of Service and Legal | USPIS<https://www.uspis.gov/terms-of-service#freedom-of-information-act>.\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG\u2019s mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \u201coversight authority\u201d for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control. Likewise, the OIG Deputy General Counsel has no authority to review FOIA determinations issued by the Postal Service or USPIS.\r\n\r\nBecause records related to external mail theft are maintained by the USPIS, we are forwarding a copy of your request to their FOIA office. They will issue a separate FOIA case number and respond to you directly. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them via email at foia@uspis.gov<mailto:foia@uspis.gov>, or in writing at:\r\n\nOffice of Counsel\r\nU.S. Postal Inspection Service FOIA/PA Unit\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Room 3301\r\nWashington, DC  20260\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

In accordance with Chapter 119.07(1), Florida Statutes and Section 1.7, Internal Management Policies and Procedures of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission we have reviewed your request. \r\nDue to the size of your request, this will take extensive staff time to complete. Pursuant to Section 119.07(4)(d), Florida Statutes, and Section 1.7, Internal Management Policies and Procedures of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, I have compiled an estimate of the associated charges, as indicated in your electronic invoice. \r\nFor your convenience you can now go online and pay for your records in the request portal. \r\nIf you wish to pay via check, please submit a check payable to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. You may mail your check, with a copy of this invoice, to the Finance and Accounting Section, 620 South Meridian Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32399. Once we have received payment, we will begin processing your request. For State Agencies, please reach out to us for the appropriate Journal Transfer Information. \r\nSince this is an estimate, should we find that additional charges apply, you will be advised in advance. Should this estimate exceed the time required, you will be eligible for a refund. If you require further assistance, please let us know. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSamantha Ganey",
