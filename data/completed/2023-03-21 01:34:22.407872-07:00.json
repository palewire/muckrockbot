        "communication": "Dear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et. seq.) for documents that detail how your community\u2019s water system functions, including details on utility terminations, restorations, and rates.\r\n\r\nAs context for this request, I am requesting these records on behalf of the People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization that advocates for equitable access, protection, and affordability of utility services, and water conservation. We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files).\r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level.\r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA.\r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area.\r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

Muckrock, the company we are working with, does send automated responses until a response is received. You asked to connect by phone or email. The numbers you left in your email did not answer. Happy to set up a time to talk this week.\r\n\r\nA few times:  4 pm Wednesday, Thursday 3:00. or Friday 4 pm. Are any of these times good for you?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nRev.

Number of youth on Grants of Conditional Liberty by race and gender, both statewide and by DYS regions.\r\n2. Number of revocations of youth on Grants of Conditional Liberty by race and gender, both statewide and by DYS regions.\r\n3. The average number of days revocated youth are held before they are returned to the community on a new Grant of Conditional Liberty, by race and gender, both statewide and by DYS regions.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBetsey Chace",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Dr. Harry Charles Steinmetz (December 8, 1898 - February 15, 1981). Dr. Steinmetz was Professor Emeritus of Psychology at San Diego State University. Between 1942 and 1980 the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitored the actions of Dr. Steinmetz as part of an ongoing program devoted to investigating suspected communists. Dr. Steinmetz sent a Freedom of Information Act request for his file in the seventies, resulting in his receiving 934 pages of documents in or about 1978.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all responsive records issued previously to Dr. Steinmetz and any that may not have been released before his death. As verification of Dr. Steinmetz's prior FOIPA release, I am attaching correspondence between Dr. Steinmetz and the Bureau. First is a February 11, 1977 response letter from the Bureau identifying 658 pages of documents responsive to Dr. Steinmetz, and second is a response to an appeal made by Dr. Steinmetz identifying an additional 276 pages of Bureau documents. These two page counts total 934 pages of documents. This correspondence can be found in the special collections archive at San Diego State University, under Dr. Steinmetz personal effects and papers (MS-0305).\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Steinmetz's privacy, as he passed away in 1981. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Dr. Steinmetz's obituary, taken from the The Los Angeles Times, as verification. As this is information the Bureau has released to other parties, there should be no further concerns over making this information public.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.

The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.

The District has assigned this request the number R000176-111622. Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nThen on November 15, 2022, the District received another records request from you.  In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

The District has assigned it the number R000177-111622.

Richland School District Policy 4040 \u2013 Public Records Request provides in part, \u201cWhen the same requester simultaneously submits multiple, separate requests or makes one or more additional requests when previous requests are open, the District may queue the requests in the order in which they were received. The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, seeking records related to law enforcement officer certification in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including ABC News, KQED, MuckRock and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking two categories of certification records:   \r\n\r\n* All certified officers \r\nAll law enforcement officers who are actively certified as of the date of this request (or when the request is processed). If your system maintains historical records of previously certified officers who are no longer active, please include them as far back as possible. If correctional officers are certified by your agency, please include them as well.  \r\n\r\n* Decertified officers\r\nAll law enforcement officers who have been decertified through revocations, voluntary surrenders, suspensions or any other actions going back as far as possible. Please include records for decertified correctional officers if available. \r\n\r\nData elements for certified officers:\r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST or state certification ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency start date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s previous departments/agencies (employment history), with start and end dates\r\n* Officer\u2019s positions and/or ranks at previous departments or agencies\r\n* Officer\u2019s original date of certification\r\n* Current status of certification (active, lapsed, expired, suspended, etc.)\r\n* Last action taken on certification\r\n* Date of last action on certification \r\n* Disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Dates of disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Training history/additional certifications of this officer, if available\r\n\r\nData elements for decertified officers: \r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence.\r\n* Officer\u2019s last department/agency, with start and end date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Decertification action taken (revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, etc.)\r\n* Date decertification action taken\r\n* POST case number, if applicable\r\n* Reason for decertification or similar action\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time.

As you have discovered, since we engineered the public portal more recently versus when our back office functionality was created 7 years ago, it does capture some search items better than our back office reporting.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that between the two, you are getting all of the responsive public data and there is no additional data responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nErik Misselt - Executive Director\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D958B0.CAD62320]\r\nBoard of Peace Officer Standards and Training\r\n1600 University Avenue, Suite 200, Saint Paul, MN 55104\r\nMain: (651) 643-3060  |  www.post.state.mn.us<http://www.post.state.mn.us>\r\nDirect # 651-201-7789\r\nerik.misselt@state.mn.us<mailto:erik.misselt@state.mn.us>\r\n\r\nNOTICE: The information contained in (and attached to) this e-mail is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the designated recipient(s) named above.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Copies of the potentially responsive documents found in response to the FOIA\r\n    1439032 I filed previously.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing the\r\n    convicted killer Charles Friedgood.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I would say the thing I'm most interested in was referenced in the article at https://caughtindot.com/nothing-like-losing-power-on-the-hottest-day-of-the-year/ and involved the manhole cover explosion near N St (where I live). I am most specifically interested in any records that relate to fixes and improvements as a result of this incident.\r\n\r\nI also am more broadly interested in, if available, information on the state of repair of the grid in my neighborhood. Records that communicate or relates to the age, condition, and capacity versus utilization of the grid in City Point would be helpful here.  In lieu of specific records on this question I would be ok with a short summary that indicates that information along with some sort of context as to the likelihood of repeat outage events this coming summer.\r\n\r\nThank you again for taking the time to tend to this.\r\n\r\n-Matt",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",
