Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\u201d \nThe City is committed to providing you with the information you are seeking. However, in order to locate the records responsive to your request, the City would need to search the files and e-mail accounts of over 7,500 City employees. Because of the broad scope of the request, there would likely be a very substantial fee associated with locating, compiling, and providing the requested information to you, as authorized by the Texas Public Information Act. Therefore, rather than just sending you a very high cost estimate for the information you have requested, we would like to see if you might be interested in narrowing the scope of your request in order to decrease or potentially eliminate any costs to you while also ensuring that you receive the specific information you would like from the City. \nFor example, you could narrow your request to include only the Mayor and Council Members. You could also limit the scope to include only certain specific employees of the City, either by name or by title, whose files you would like the City to search for responsive records. I offer these ideas only as examples of ways that you could limit the scope of your request in order to make things more expedient for you. There certainly may be other approaches that you could take to limit that scope. \nPlease be advised that if the City does not receive a written response from you by the 61st day after the date this letter is sent to you, your request for public information is considered to have been withdrawn by you. \nYou may send your response using one of the following methods: Open Records Portal: https://www.fortworthtexas.gov/departments/citysecretary/records Email: PIC@fortworthtexas.gov In person:  \nOfficer for Public Information OR Public Information Administrator \n100 Fort Worth Trail, 7th Floor, City Secretary's Service Window \nFort Worth, Texas 76102 Mail:  \nOfficer for Public Information OR Public Information Administrator \n100 Fort Worth Trail, 7th Floor \nFort Worth, Texas 76102 \nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter. The City looks forward to working with you to provide you with the information you are seeking. \nSincerely, \nJaclyn Shepard \nPublic Information Coordinator \nCity Secretary's Office \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the",
