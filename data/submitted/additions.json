All Appeals filed by McLennan County to recent non compliance. All interoffice memos, reprimands, or correspondence between Sheriff McNamara, Cody Blossman, Major Pam Whitlock and others concerning recent failure to take prisoner to dialysis and subsequent complaint and activities surrounding the Complaint to Jail Standards and results. THIS will probably go to the AG's office once again and if they charge you people, well, it's because they don't want this known and the subsequent coverups. JAIL NON COMPLIANCE is not gossip by the way considering the severity of kidney disease AND the known lack of supervision at the jail.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
