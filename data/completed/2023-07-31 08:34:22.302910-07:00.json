        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMeghan Leong",

We are providing the list kept by the Prosecuting Attorney's Office (PAO) in an excel spreadsheet. Most of the entries in the list are violations reported from other agency's such as the Washington State Patrol (WSP). There are only four entries concerning Jefferson County employees. All of them are from the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). Please log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve your responsive documents: County Public Records Request - C002010-071323  The PAO maintains documentation files for some or all of the four JCSO entries in the list we have provided. If you would like to receive the records in those documentation files, please let us know and we will provide them to you. But since, in your records request, you have only asked for a \"list\", we consider our response to this records request to be complete.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

This request seeks a copy of any communications between the Solicitor's office and/or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the East Collier Property Owners and their lawyers at the firm Hunton & Williams/Hunton AK concerning this white paper or SOL's review of said white paper.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur regulations require that your request must explicitly state that you will pay all fees associated with processing the request, that you will pay fees up to a specified amount, and/or that you are seeking a fee waiver.  Your request does not fulfill this requirement because you have stated \u201cIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\u201d Therefore, we are unable to process your request at this time.  If you wish to pursue your request, please provide fee clarification as it is unclear if you will pay fees.\r\nAccording to our regulations, if we do not receive your written response clarifying these points within 20 workdays from the date of this communication, we will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request. In such circumstances, we will not be able to comply with your request and will close our file on it.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.6(c)<http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=0fc3ab3499768eebc2e3691c8cf88dec&rgn=div5&view=text&node=43:1.1.1.1.2&idno=43#se43.1.2_16>and \u00a7 2.51(c)<http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=0fc3ab3499768eebc2e3691c8cf88dec&rgn=div5&view=text&node=43:1.1.1.1.2&idno=43#se43.1.2_151>.\r\n\r\nIn the future if you would like to address fees in your initial request, we could perfect your request upon receipt unless of course we need clarification regarding something else.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our response to your request, you may contact Tiffany McClurkin by email at foiar4@fws.gov<mailto:foiar4@fws.gov> or by phone at (404) 679-4104.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\nTiffany McClurkin\r\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service\r\nHeadquarters Information Resources & Technology Management\r\nAtlanta Regional Office\r\nFOIA Coordinator",

As a reporter who plans to use the public records I have requested to publish newsworthy articles of interest to the American public, I request a fee waiver for this FOIA request. Specifically, the records that I am requesting from your agency will significantly contribute to the American public's understanding of whether and how the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is protecting the endangered Florida panther's habitat in southern Florida, including its approach to private landowners who are seeking an incident take permit in Collier County, Florida. It will also shed light on which business interests and lobbyists are influencing the agency's decision making, including the agency's administration of FOIA. The Florida panther's survival, and the general implementation of the ESA, is an issue of the utmost importance, as it pertains directly to the U.S. government's commitment to mitigating the extinction crisis that threatens wildlife around the country. As such, I request all fees in this matter be waived.\r\n\r\nI have a long track record of publishing important stories of public interests on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and intend to continue doing this work with the help of the documents your agency provides. You can find an example of my work here: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-administration-us-endangered-species-discussions-secret\r\n\r\nIf the agency denies me a fee waiver, I am willing to pay up to $50 in fees.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, please contact me at 248-763-0088.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias\r\n",

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Mr. Tobias,\r\n\r\nThanks for your response.\r\n\r\nYou have asked us to waive the fees for processing your request.  Our FOIA regulations state that bureaus will waive, or partially waive, fees if disclosure of all or part of the information is (1) In the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, and (2) Not primarily in your commercial interest. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.45(a).  Our FOIA regulations also provide four specific criteria that are used to determine whether these two requirements are met.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.48(a).  Your request meets the requirements and your fee waiver has been granted.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our response to your request, you may contact Tiffany McClurkin by email at foiar4@fws.gov<mailto:foiar4@fws.gov> or by phone at (404) 679-4104.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\nTiffany McClurkin\r\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service\r\nHeadquarters Information Resources & Technology Management\r\nAtlanta Regional Office\r\nFOIA Coordinator",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

This was to ensure that all inmates experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 would seek immediate medical attention. On September 1, 2021, the health care fee was reinstated.  No inmate is ever denied medical services due to a lack of funds.\r\n\r\nYour request is now closed.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Due to the number of reference requests received -- including virtual consultation requests -- and the limitation of staff time available to answer correspondence, requests may take approximately 3 weeks to receive a response.\r\n\r\nOur research room is open on a limited basis. Research visits are by appointment only. At this stage in our reopening, we are scheduling visits no more than three months in advance as we are closely monitoring local public health metrics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research room hours will be Monday-Friday, 9:00am-5:00pm. Please contact visit_archives2@nara.gov to request a research appointment. \r\n\r\nOne cart of records may be pulled in advance if accurate and complete information is provided when a research appointment is scheduled. Please provide us with the citations for the records you would like to view -- including Record Group #, Entry #, Series Title, and Container #(s) -- when confirming your appointment. Please note that due to the high demand of ad hoc (day-of) pulls, advance pulls are not guaranteed. \r\n\r\nIt is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you schedule a virtual consultation BEFORE scheduling a research appointment, particularly if you do not know the specific boxes you would like to request; working with a reference consultant will help you better prepare for your visit. Contact archives2reference@nara.gov to schedule a virtual consultation. \r\n\r\nPlease monitor our web page (https://www.archives.gov/college-park) for details and updates, as the situation can change quickly.

We\r\nreceived it in this office on July 7, 2022.\r\n\r\nWe have identified two files designated as Third Army Operations Diary\r\nfiles. Attached is a Reproduction Service Order for copies of the file and\r\ninstructions for payment.\r\n\r\nYour request for field reports, hand notations, photographs and\r\nintelligence reports and lists of all German prisoners taken by the 3rd\r\nArmy and its units, listed by name and location of capture is for topics\r\nrather than specific identifiable documents. We make reasonable efforts to\r\nassist researchers with their work. As a matter of policy, the National\r\nArchives is staffed to assist researchers with their work, including but\r\nnot limited to pointing researchers to helpful finding aids to begin their\r\nresearch. However, given the limitations on staff resources, we do not\r\ngenerally conduct substantive research in response to requests filed under\r\nthe Freedom of Information Act, except in circumstances where documents are\r\neasily locatable.\r\n\r\nThe materials you are requesting are already open for public viewing in our\r\nresearch room at the National Archives in College Park, MD, located at 8601\r\nAdelphi Road, College Park, MD.  Since there are no access restrictions on\r\nthese documents, there is no need to file a Freedom of Information Act\r\nrequest with the National Archives.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this an adverse response, you may appeal by writing to the\r\nDeputy Archivist (ND), National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi\r\nRoad, College Park, Maryland, 20740-6001, and explain why you think our\r\nsearch does not meet the requirements of the FOIA. You also may email your\r\nappeal to foia@nara.gov. Please note \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" in\r\nthe subject line of your email and be sure to include your case number.\r\nYour appeal must be sent within 60 days of the date of this letter.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. R. E. Cookson, Archivist\r\nTextual Records (RR2RR)\r\nNational Archives II at\r\nCollege Park, Maryland\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to: David Van Cortlandt Crosby; David Crosby; The Byrds; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 2023, I submitted Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request number 1580835-000 via MuckRock seeking all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records on David Crosby, aka David Van Cortlandt Crosby (August 14, 1941 \u2013 January 18, 2023). The Bureau responded on February 3, 2023, stating officials had conducted a main entity search of the Central Records System and could not locate any responsive records, and advising that I could file an additional request should I identify new information pertinent to Mr. Crosby and the Bureau. I am attaching a PDF file outlining instances in which Mr. Crosby or associates of Mr. Crosby interacted with FBI agents, or were surveilled by the Bureau more broadly. I will summarize the contents herein:\r\n\r\nIn December 1985, Mr. Crosby turned himself in to the Bureau's West Palm Beach field office in relation to an outstanding warrant issued by the state of Texas for a parole violation. The violation was connected to charges stemming from a 1983 arrest for possession of cocaine and a .45-caliber pistol. An FBI agent identified as a supervisor at the West Palm Beach field office, Bob Neumann, publicly commented on the case to the press, stating that Mr. Crosby turned himself in because he had learned from his lawyer that the FBI was going to \"look for him\"; Agent Neumann also told reporters that Mr. Crosby looked \"to be under the influence of something ... and extremely uptight\" at the time he turned himself in. The year prior, Mr. Crosby's then-girlfriend, Jan Dee Dance, was brought up on federal charges connected to a separate case involving drugs and a handgun. A September 1984 story sent out nationally by wire service United Press International states that Ms. Dance submitted an affidavit to the Bureau identifying Mr. Crosby by name and explaining her relationship with him between the years of 1977 and 1984.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Bureau created files on a number of friends and associates of Mr. Crosby in the late 1960s, including the rock acts Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead. A Bureau memorandum, dated September 5, 1969, can be found in the FBI files of all three groups. The memo identifies that an informant or person used as a source of information attended the Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly shortened as simply Woodstock, and submitted a report by mail on the event. Mr. Crosby is identified as one of the entertainers that performed at the festival, with information in the report stating his band Crosby, Stills, and Nash played on the night of August 17, 1969. That Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead, among others, are listed in the Woodstock report, and the Bureau created files on all three parties, would suggest the Bureau created a file on Mr. Crosby and/or one of his many bands from that period, to include: The Byrds; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting the Bureau conduct an additional search for all of the following: David Van Cortlandt Crosby; David Crosby; The Byrds; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Crosby's privacy, as he passed away on January 18, 2023. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. In addition to the aforementioned PDF file, I am also attaching a reproduction of Mr. Crosby's obituary in the New York Times. For expediency's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/arts/music/david-crosby-dead.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

The Bureau responded on February 3,\r\n    2023, stating officials had conducted a main entity search of the Central\r\n    Records System and could not locate any responsive records, and advising\r\n    that I could file an additional request should I identify new information\r\n    pertinent to Mr. Crosby and the Bureau. I am attaching a PDF file outlining\r\n    instances in which Mr. Crosby or associates of Mr. Crosby interacted with\r\n    FBI agents, or were surveilled by the Bureau more broadly.\r\n    \r\n    In December 1985, Mr. Crosby turned himself in to the Bureau's West Palm\r\n    Beach field office in relation to an outstanding warrant issued by the state\r\n    of Texas for a parole violation. The violation was connected to charges\r\n    stemming from a 1983 arrest for possession of cocaine and a .45-caliber\r\n    pistol. An FBI agent identified as a supervisor at the West Palm Beach field\r\n    office, Bob Neumann, publicly commented on the case to the press, stating\r\n    that Mr. Crosby turned himself in because he had learned from his lawyer\r\n    that the FBI was going to \"look for him. The year prior, Mr. Crosby's\r\n    then-girlfriend, Jan Dee Dance, was brought up on federal charges connected\r\n    to a separate case involving drugs and a handgun. A September 1984 story\r\n    sent out nationally by wire service United Press International states that\r\n    Ms. Dance submitted an affidavit to the Bureau identifying Mr. Crosby by\r\n    name and explaining her relationship with him between the years of 1977 and\r\n    1984.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, the Bureau created files on a number of friends and associates\r\n    of Mr. Crosby in the late 1960s, including the rock acts Jimi Hendrix,\r\n    Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead. A Bureau memorandum, dated\r\n    September 5, 1969, can be found in the FBI files of all three groups. The\r\n    memo identifies that an informant or person used as a source of information\r\n    attended the Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly shortened as simply\r\n    Woodstock, and submitted a report by mail on the event. Mr. Crosby is\r\n    identified as one of the entertainers that performed at the festival, with\r\n    information in the report stating his band Crosby, Stills, and Nash played\r\n    on the night of August 17, 1969. That Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, and\r\n    the Grateful Dead, among others, are listed in the Woodstock report, and the\r\n    Bureau created files on all three parties, would suggest the Bureau created\r\n    a file on Mr. Crosby and/or one of his many bands from that period, to\r\n    include: The Byrds; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and\r\n    Young.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll video recorded in a series of September 2018 drone flights near Point Lay, Alaska that sought to conduct a walrus survey.  Remote pilot is Anthon Fischbein.  The RIDs are listed as:\r\n\r\n  *   RID 18-4161\r\n  *   RID 18-4160\r\n  *   RID 18-4159\r\n  *   RID 18-4158\r\n  *   RID 18-4157\r\n  *   RID 18-4140\r\n  *   RID 18-4138\r\n  *   RID 18-4135\r\n  *   RID 18-4133\r\n  *   RID 18-4141\r\n  *   RID 18-4137\r\n  *   RID 18-4136\r\n  *   RID 18-4134\r\n  *   RID 18-4139\r\n  *   RID 18-4095\r\n  *   RID 18-4094\r\n  *   RID 18-4090\r\n  *   RID 18-4093\r\n  *   RID 18-4092\r\n  *   RID 18-4091\r\n  *   RID 18-4043\r\n  *   RID 18-4042\r\n  *   RID 18-4031\r\n  *   RID 18-4030\r\n  *   RID 18-4026\r\n  *   RID 18-4025\r\n  *   RID 18-4014\r\n  *   RID 18-3986\r\n  *   RID 18-3985\r\n  *   RID 18-3984\r\n  *   RID 18-3960\r\n  *   RID 18-3959\r\n  *   RID 18-3962\r\n  *   RID 18-3961\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/part-2#2.39>.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g)<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/part-2#2.37>.\r\n\r\nYou have agreed to pay up to $200.00 for the processing of your request.  If we find that this will not cover the cost of processing your request, we will stop processing your request at the point this amount has been reached and will let you know before we incur additional charges. You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track.  There are 12 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue.  Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by July 25, 2023.\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly by communicating with us at foia@usgs.gov<mailto:foia@usgs.gov>.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requests and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\nCollege Park, Maryland  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:  (202) 741-5770\r\nFax:  (202) 741-5769\r\nToll-free:  1 (877) 684-6448\r\nEmail:  ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nWeb:  https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department's FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.\r\n\r\nContact information for the Department's FOIA Public Liaison, who you may also seek dispute resolution services from, is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about your request, you may contact me by email at foia@usgs.gov<mailto:foia@usgs.gov> or jewilson@usgs.gov<mailto:jewilson@usgs.gov>.
