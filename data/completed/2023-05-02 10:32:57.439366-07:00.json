This documentation should include, where available: executive summaries of the algorithm/model's purpose, lists of the data sources, breakdowns of how the model weights various input data, descriptions of the statistical or machine learning techniques employed, the results of validation and accuracy testing, disparate impact studies, and algorithmic impact reports.\r\n\r\n3) A data dictionary/library for each predictive or detection model or algorithm identified in response to items 1 and 2 of this requests.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of any internal or independent audits of the identified models or algorithms.\r\n\r\n5) Aggregate or disaggregated data, if any exists, breaking down the risk scores or outputs of the fraud model.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The Sherriff\u2019s Office provided me with the incident number 2107220284/case number 21015344 and incident number 2301220136/case number 23001556. If you have any additional case numbers or information, let me know.\r\n\r\nFirst we have to see from the law enforcement agency if we are authorized to release the audio. If we are authorized to release it, we will have your request done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by Florida State Statute Section 365.171(12)(a) and 401.30 to redact certain information from 911 calls. Section 365.171(12)(a), F.S., provides that any record, recording, or information, or portions thereof, obtained by a public agency for the purpose of providing services in an emergency which reveals the name, address, or telephone number or personal information about, or information which may identify any person requesting emergency service or reporting an emergency by accessing an emergency communications E911 system is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), F.S.  Additionally, under 401.30, records of emergency calls which contain patient examination or treatment information are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and may not be disclosed without the consent of the person to whom they pertain, but appropriate limited disclosure may be made without such consent to the person\u2019s guardian, to the next of kin if the person is deceased, or to a parent if the person is a minor.\r\n\r\nOnce your request is complete, we could email over an invoice. You could be charged for labor at a rate of $29.94 an hour if the request takes longer than 30 minutes to pull the audio. We will let you know if it reaches that point. As long as the audio is redacted, the audio file is small enough to be attached to an email and there isn't a labor charge we must receive payment for first, we can send it over email as soon as your request is complete, free of charge. If you prefer the audio be burnt onto a CD, the cost will be $0.30 for the CD and $1.76 for postage if mailed. We accept cash and checks.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa\n",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a Freedom of Information Act appeal regarding FOIA request No. 2020-03749.\r\n\r\nI. The Request\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 2020, Reason Magazine reporter C.J. Ciaramella submitted a FOIA request to the Bureau of Prisons (hereafter \u201cBOP\u201d) seeking \u201cany mortality reviews conducted regarding inmate deaths at FMC Carswell between Jan. 1, 2015 and May 4, 2020\u201d and \u201cany mortality reviews conducted regarding inmate deaths at FCI Aliceville between Jan. 1, 2015 and May 4, 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe request was received and assigned tracking number 2020-03749. On March 30, 2022 the BOP issued a final response, releasing 288 pages, 84 of which were withheld in part under the following exemptions: (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7)(C).\r\n\r\nII. The argument\r\n\r\nA. BOP did not respond to the request for records concerning FCI Aliceville\r\n\r\nBOP\u2019s final response (see attached) misstates the original request, mentioning only the request for records from FMC Carswell but not FCI Aliceville. Please inform the requester if there are responsive records from Aliceville or conduct the required search.\r\n\r\nB. BOP has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the responsive documents are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.\r\n\r\nInformation redacted from the multi-level mortality review reports under (b)(5) includes the review committee\u2019s findings on the timeliness and appropriateness of diagnostic and treatment regimens; problems encountered during the medical emergency, such as transportation and communication; whether there was adequate documentation in the patient\u2019s medical files; and whether the patient received appropriate and adequate medical care per BOP\u2019s policies. Also withheld were the committee\u2019s findings regarding the strengths and weaknesses of care delivered, and recommendations for improving future care under BOP's policies.\r\n\r\nTo qualify for FOIA\u2019s deliberative process privilege, an agency must demonstrate, not simply declare, that the withheld documents are both \u201cpre-decisional\u201d and \u201cdeliberative.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A document is pre-decisional if it was \u201cgenerated before the adoption of an agency policy\u201d and deliberative if it reflects the \u201cgive-and-take of the consultative process.\u201d Id. The privilege does not protect material that is \u201cpurely factual\u201d or \u201can agency\u2019s final opinions, statements or policy and interpretations definitively adopted by the agency, and any document having \u2018the force and effect of law.\u2019\u201d Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 861 F.2d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 1988). Nor does the privilege shield records that merely describe or explain decisions that have already been made. E.g., Taxation With Representation Fund, Inc. v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677-78 (D.C. Cir. 1981). \r\n\r\nCourts regularly order agencies to disclose final assessments of their performance under existing policy, even if officials might someday draw on those evaluations in future policy decisions. See, e.g., Cowdery, Ecker & Murphy, L.L.C. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 511 F. Supp. 2d 215, 221 (D. Conn. 2007) (requiring an agency to disclose an employee\u2019s \u201cself-assessment and his supervisor\u2019s recommendations and assessment of his performance\u201d because they were not \u201cdeliberations or recommendations on Department policy\u201d); Chicago Tribune Co. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., No. 95-C-3917, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2308 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 26, 1997) (requiring disclosure of factual assessments by agency auditors reviewing an outside study). \r\n\r\nThe multi-level mortality review reports at issue are created as a matter of routine in the event of any death in BOP custody. The reports constitute conclusions and facts found by the review committee regarding compliance with BOP policy, but they are not in any way related to the shaping or drafting of those policies. Because the withheld information was created independent of any particular legal or policy matter, and because it concerns BOP\u2019s compliance with existing policies,  the records are neither predecisional nor deliberative. BOP\u2019s withholding is erroneous because it applies Exemption 5\u2019s deliberative process privilege to final, objective assessments of the agency\u2019s compliance with existing policy in a manner that is contrary to settled law.\r\n\r\n***\r\nFor the reasons above, the requester respectfully requests that the BOP produce the withheld portions of the reports, fulfill the request for similar records from FCI Aliceville or inform the requester that no responsive records were located, and respond to this appeal within 20 days. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this appeal, please contact me directly at 503-951-9863.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nCJ Ciaramella",

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the 'Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request' link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 115 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 653 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,432 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,008 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is July 2021.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

State and local agencies that spent less than $100,000 may voluntarily submit reports (RCW 40.14.026(5)).\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2021 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2020.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\nThis public records request is being made via email.

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Siobhan.  I am in receipt of your Right to Know request.  In New Hampshire we have two types of medical and residential facilities: those that are licensed only and those that are both licensed and certified.  Certified means that the facility is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to participate in those programs.  Examples of facilities that are licensed only include Residential Care Facilities, Supported Residential Health Care Facilities and Walk-in Care Facilities.  In other words, these are facilities that do not receive reimbursement from CMS.  Examples of facilities that are both licensed and certified include Hospitals, Nursing homes and most Ambulatory Surgical Centers.  Information relative to fines imposed against facilities that are licensed only is confidential under RSA 151:13 and is exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A:5,IV.  RSA 151:13 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n 151:13 Information Confidential. \u2013 Information received or created by the department of health and human services, through inspection or otherwise, authorized hereunder shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed publicly except in a proceeding involving the question of licensure or revocation of license pursuant to RSA 541-A. The department may disclose such information after it denies, suspends or revokes a license pursuant to RSA 151:7, II.\r\n\r\nDHHS does not impose fines against facilities that are certified.  Rather it is CMS that does that.  For the above reasons, your Right to Know request is denied due to the fact that DHHS does not have any public records that are responsive to your request.  Below is a link to the Enforcement Actions page of the CMS website.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnforcement Actions | CMS<https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency/enforcement-actions>\r\nPart C and Part D Enforcement Actions | CMS<https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Compliance-and-Audits/Part-C-and-Part-D-Compliance-and-Audits/PartCandPartDEnforcementActions->\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn B.
