I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request all records within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice (DOJ) within the time frame of 2017 to 2023, to be the day on which this request is processed, and with respect to the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Records that detail if or what manner the fourth amendment may apply in the context of a private employer compelling employees to submit to reasonable suspicion testing given the direct nexus of SAMHSA, when it is known that such private employer complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, if such records exist within the DOJ\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the volume (ie, numerically) of civil rights complaints in the context of employment that fall outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n3. Records that detail how the DOJ Civil Rights Division separates out potential civil rights violations in the context of employment if such civil rights violations fall outside the scope of the EEOC. Additionally, I request, if known to the DOJ, what agency is most appropriate if a civil rights violation occurs in the context of employment but falls outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail how a private employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the federal government, or acting under the direction of the federal government under the pretense of reasonable suspicion testing per the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and given the direct nexus to SAMHSA under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. Records related to the handling of fictitious or materially false statements to federal government agencies made by private employers.\r\n\r\n3. Records related to if or in what manner a private employer, if such private employer can be proven to be acting on behalf of the federal government, can conspire against rights (in oppressing an employee\u2019s civil rights) and the distinction between a civil and criminal manner pertaining to conspiracy against rights, if any such record exists.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to a private employer and consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions to such private employer when intentionally abusing or defrauding the United States (ie, a Federal Government Agency) and in what manner it can be said to be so, according to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n5. Records related to remedy available to employees when civil rights can be meaningfully construed to have been violated by a private employer, if such records exist.\r\n\r\n6. The most appropriate agency for which an employee may seek remedy for civil rights violations by a private employer, if not the DOJ Civil Rights Division, and if known to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate an approximate time frame for this request to be processed. Depending on the time frame for the request to be fulfilled and any fees that may be incurred, I may revise the criteria.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Robert Lowell Moore, Jr., aka Robin Moore (October 31, 1925 \u2013 February 21, 2008). He was an author of such books as The Green Berets, The French Connection, and Court Martial. All or some of this file has been released to a prior requestor(s); a portion was published by a now defunct blog, Entropic Memes, in 2008. Mr. Moore's case file number is identified by that requestor as 94-61092. Please see attached documents and the following link archived by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165610/http://www.slugsite.com/archives/897\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting any parts of Mr. Moore's file that have been released previously and those not yet released.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search for Mr. Moore. This would include any files the bureau may have on the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana, or JURE (Bureau file number 105-114543; Miami file number 105-6661).\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Moore's privacy, as he passed away on February 21, 2008. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. Please see attached documents and the following link, for an obituary published by the New York Times on February 23, 2008: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/books/23moore.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Per the bureau's prior release of Mr. Moore's file, at least one bureau memo, dated May 5, 1965, states of The Green Berets, \"classified information is contained in Moore's book.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored Mr. Moore in this period as well. Please see a clip of press coverage about The Green Berets, attached, which was archived by the CIA shortly after the May 5, 1965 bureau memo. This document can found in the CIA's CREST system and in the Reading Room on its website: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00149R000700610012-8.pdf\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how the bureau and other agencies handled investigations into journalists and writers who covered or disclosed the actions of American intelligence agencies is in the public's interest.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Under the Louisiana Public Records Act, I am requesting an opportunity to obtain the records of communications between city officials and representatives of Airbnb rental homes from March 1, 2020 to the date of this request. With specific regards to the agreement referred to in the New York Times article titles: \u201cNew Orleans Becomes New Model for Airbnb to Work With Cities.\u201d The said article acknowledges how Airbnb reached a deal with the City of New Orleans to legalize short-term rentals. I am requesting documents that support the terms of the deal presented in the article. \r\n\r\nOne excerpt of the article that we request documents for emphasizes the statement \u201cIn New Orleans specifically, Airbnb agreed to share data \u2014 such as the names and addresses of its hosts \u2014 with the city, something the company has balked at doing elsewhere. Airbnb also agreed that its hosts must operate with a permit, with hosts automatically being registered with the city when they sign up to the service. In a nod to the local hotel industry, Airbnb will also ban almost all listings in the city\u2019s historic French Quarter and set a 90-day annual cap for hosts who rent out entire homes.\u201d\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records onto a compact disc, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50 (including any associated delivery/postage fees). This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 44:32(D) of the Louisiana Public Records Act requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect electronic copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nPlease feel free to call or email me with any questions on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The hurricane and levee system failure were disastrous, but were followed by the stock market crash of 2008, so I would additionally request data about how that affected the rebuilding and rebranding of New Orleans during the market failure in 2007. I would appreciate receiving feedback in a timely manner and look forward to receiving a\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonah Rosenstein",
