Sholly (For reference, please see the attached record, obtained through a records request, stating the occurrence of this incident).\r\n\r\nIf there are any datasets or tables pertaining to the requested information, please provide them in Microsoft Excel files rather than PDFs. For any relevant emails, please include all attachments to all messages.\r\n\r\nPlease do send records as they become available.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to modify this request if doing so would reduce the time it will take you to comply. Do let me know if this would be necessary.\r\n\r\nIf any aspect of this request is unreasonable pursuant to FOIL, exempt from the law, or unavailable, that should not slow provision of the rest of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf your agency finds a part of the request to be exempt from public release, the law requires that you do not withhold the document entirely but rather redact that part of the record.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny any portion of my request, please provide a written explanation for the denial, including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) authorizing the withholding of all or part of the record, as well as an explanation of why you believe disclosure is prevented by law (Article 6 Section 87.) Please also provide me with an email where I may send any appeals.\r\n\r\nPlease communicate with me by email rather than regular mail regarding my request. I would be happy to answer any questions that you have.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSanjana Bhambhani",
