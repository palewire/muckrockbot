        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDocuments pertaining to DOCCS policy or documentation about inter-prison transfers of incarcerated people (see below for a note about what is meant by \u201cinter-prison transfers,\u201d in case the term is unclear or does not align with DOCCS terminology). Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n\r\n1) All policies, procedures, memorandums of understanding, intergovernmental agreements, any other sort of agreement, and all related directive materials regarding the transfer of incarcerated persons between different facilities within New York state. \r\n\r\n2) From 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2021 specifically: all documents, papers, letters, email correspondence, memoranda, training materials, presentations, directives, guidance, press releases, or other communications (both internal and external) about transfers and COVID-19. This includes \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss transfer procedures and mention COVID-19, health precautions, and/or respiratory illness. It also includes (but is not limited to) any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss changes to the frequency of transfers in response to the virus (e.g., halting transfers, minimizing transfers, transferring at-risk incarcerated people, etc.). \r\n\r\n3) Any contracts or agreements regarding inter-prison transfers, including but not limited to a contract with a private transfer company, vehicle purchasing or leasing, and so on.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON DEFINITION: By inter-prison transfer, I am referring to any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility,\u201d as recorded in DOCCS\u2019s \u201cIncarcerated Lookup\u201d database. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. If the records provided refer to movements more broadly than this definition of transfers, that is acceptable and please send them. However, if there are records that refer ONLY to types of movements that would not include inter-prison transfers as defined here, they fall outside of this request. If there is any question about this, please feel free to reach out and I am happy to clarify.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIolanthe Brooks",

I understand that this information might be collected in different ways and have outlined specific requests in relation to what I anticipate might be possible below. If none of the below is possible or if records pertinent to prison transfers (i.e., movements) are collected/saved in a way that I have not captured, please contact me with more information. I am flexible and can modify my request to be responsive to the records that exist.\r\n\r\nREQUEST: \r\nI request information on movements/transfers between DOCCS facilities conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. This would include any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility\u201d as listed on DOCCS's \"Incarcerated Lookup,\" for example. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. This would not include movements such as: a temporary transfer to a hospital for a medical procedure; a temporary transfer to court for a court appointment; or a one-night or few-hour \u201cstop-over\u201d at a DOCCS facility on the way to another facility. \r\n\r\nIf movements/transfers are recorded in such a way as to distinguish movements that result in changes in housing facility from temporary movements, then I request records of every inter-facility, non-temporary (as described above) transfer made in 2020 and 2021. For each, I request the following insofar as is possible: \r\n\r\na)\tThe name of the sending facility \r\nb)\tThe name of the receiving facility\r\nc)\tThe date of the transfer\r\nd)\tThe reason for transfer \r\ne)\tAny transfer considerations, as recorded/described\r\nf)\tAny additional explanation of the causes for transfer, as recorded/described\r\ng)\tUnique identifier for each person transferred, if possible \r\n\r\nCONTINGENCIES: \r\nIf transfers are not disaggregated between temporary movements and non-temporary movements, then I request the above information for all movements. \r\n\r\nHowever these records are available is acceptable, with the priority being records that include the information listed above (including if this means requesting multiple types of records). \r\n\r\nFor example, if the information above is available in a summary table organized by day, week, month, or another unit of time, I request that summary table. Or, if it is available as redacted versions of transfer forms for each transfer, then I request those forms (such as form 8.6, \u201cTransfer Referral,\u201d KITSM86; or form 4.5.1 \u201cTransfer Review,\u201d KGNCM4B). In other words, I\u2019m flexible with what is available based on DOCCS record-making and record-keeping systems. If the above is impossible, please contact me to discuss what is available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is an expedited request by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, MuckRock, and the California Newsroom (\u201cBrown Institute,\u201d\u201cMuckRock,\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Newsroom\u201d) under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, for all submitted, denied and confirmed exceptional events related to criteria pollutants in EPA Region 1. A partial list of Example Submissions, Demonstrations and EPA responses prepared under the 2016 Exceptional Events Rule has been publicly posted by the EPA here: https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/example-demonstrations-and-epa-responses-prepared-under-2016-exceptional\r\n\r\nDocument Request\r\n\r\nWe seek copies of the following records submitted to and prepared by the EPA Regional Office between September 30, 2016, through May 08, 2023:\r\n\r\n1. All initial notification packages created by state, local, or tribal agencies now held by the EPA Regional Office. By this language, we intend to include emails or any other records of communication containing, for example, the potential date of event, relevant criteria pollutant, location, and potential regulatory decision affected (such as designation, classification, attainment determination, attainment date extension, or finding of SIP inadequacy leading to SIP call). An example of an Initial Notification Summary for PM2.5 from EPA Region 9 has been attached to this request.\r\n2. Any acknowledgement or response from EPA to initial notifications or notification packages, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14 (Table 2).\r\n3. All submissions of demonstrations of exceptional events related to criteria pollutants, as submitted by state, local, or federal authorities.\r\n4. All subsequent responses and decisions communicated by the EPA, including approvals, denials or requests for more information, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14.\r\n\r\nWe request that all of these records be produced in their native electronic formats with any attached metadata included, so long as such electronic files can be opened using standard commercially available software. If the files cannot be produced in this manner, we request that records be produced in an alternative electronic format that is text-searchable. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B)\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in the Brown Institute, MuckRock, or California Newsroom\u2019s commercial interest, 45 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nDisclosure Is in the Public Interest\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the regulation of air pollution, which is harmful to human health. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(1). In particular, the requested information will shed light on exceptional events, a mechanism used by regulators to account for and exclude air pollution, information which is not \u201calready in the public domain.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(i). As a nonprofit organization assisting other news media organizations on coverage of federal government policy, we have demonstrated our \u201cability and intention to effectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees\r\n\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are a member of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are \u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nWe also ask that the information requested be disclosed on an expedited basis. Expedited processing is appropriate here because a \u201ccompelling need\u201d exists for disclosure of the requested information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public, there is \u201can urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a75.27(b)(2).\r\n\r\nAs a news organization, we are primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. Over the last several years, wildfires have grown, and with them, so has pollution from particulate matter and ozone. Climate change is a significant factor in the understanding of five of the six criteria pollutants, and understanding how criteria pollution overall is excepted is crucial to public understanding of the management of health risks. The information requested thus concerns \u201ca matter of exigency to the American public\u201d and \u201cthe consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest.\u201d Bloomberg, L.P. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 310 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). We therefore request that if the EPA determines that an exemption applies that it also provide specific reasons why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the EPA release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you have any questions or concerns about what we are seeking, please do not hesitate to contact us at the email address below. Pursuant to the applicable FOIA provision and departmental regulations, we expect a response regarding this request within the ten (10) working day time limit set by law. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.27(c); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrown Institute, MuckRock, and California Newsroom\r\n\u2105 Brown Institute for Media Innovation\r\n2950 Broadway\r\nNew York NY 10027\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC and/or its parent entity, The Johns Hopkins Univeristy (UEI: FTMTDMBR29C7)\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into the physical effects of directed energy attacks, as currently there is a concern among the members of the media and the public about so-called anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2016, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents under the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC has been awarded contracts or grants covering similar research areas by the Department of Defense; award IDs N0002420F8124 and N0002421F8162 are active with the Naval Sea Systems Command as of May 2023 for work on \"directed energy bio effects.\" This request would contribute to public understanding of how the government is handling research on anomalous health incidents and unconventionally acquired brain injuries.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

For example footage of Aaron at a gas station before the murder, footage of Odin Lloyd being picked up by Aaron as well as footage of Aaron arriving home with a gun on him.\r\n\r\nI also kindly ask for the footage of his police interview as well as the CCTV footage of him breaking his phone.\r\n\r\nAll in all I\u2019d like every single video exhibit that was presented at the Odin Lloyd trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I am asking for all of this is because I believe that there are important life lessons to be learned from this appalling crime.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
