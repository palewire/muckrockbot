I am currently a student journalist at Emerson College and have reported about the South River encampment in the past. As these records pertain to the transparency of our public officials in the treatment of homeless community members on public grounds, I would request the fees for this request be waived on the grounds of clear public interest as is suggested by the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. As section 24-31(g)(vii) lays out how fees should not be charged in regards to processing claims in filing appeals to recover property pursuant to the \"City Storage Program Policy,\" I would ask that this standard be extended to this request as it is not made in the commercial interest but in the interest of transparency regarding the same policy. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and will not be made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Nu\u00f1ez",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission is in receipt of your request under the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law (RTKL). You requested, \"any records reflecting a complaint, charge, or disciplinary action concerning any violation (or alleged violation) of scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy.  Any records reflecting any warning issued to any employee concerning the scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy.  Any policy, guidance, regulation, or handbook concerning the scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy.  This request is limited to records generated on or after May 5, 2024.\"  A complete copy of your request is below for your ease of reference.\r\n\r\nYour request is denied, in-part, and granted, in-part, as described below.\r\n\r\nYour request is denied, in-part, as the RTKL provides that certain investigative records are exempt from public access or disclosure.  For example, a record of an agency relating to a non-criminal investigation is exempt from disclosure. See, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(17); and, Pennsylvania Game Comm'n v. Fennell, 149 A.3d 101 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016) (holding complaints submitted to agency non-public).  The non-criminal investigative exemption covers, \"[i]nvestigative materials, notes, correspondence, and reports; and, a record that, if disclosed, would...reveal the institution, progress, or result of an agency investigation.\"  65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.708(b)(17)(ii) and 67.708(b)(17)(vi)(A).  Therefore, to the extent any documents concerning the above-referenced matter(s) exists, such records are investigatory and the request is denied.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your request is denied, in-part, as written criticisms of an employee; grievance material, including documents related to discrimination or sexual harassment; and information regarding discipline, demotion or discharge contained in a personnel file are exempt from disclosure.  See, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.708(b)(7)(vi)(vii)(viii).\r\n\r\nAlthough records of a final action from an agency that results in a demotion or discharge are presumed public, the PGC performed an extensive search of its systems and determined it does not have records of a final action that resulted in a demotion or discharge for any violation of the scandalous or disgraceful conduct policy. The PGC does not possess these records.\r\n\r\nYour request is granted in the remainder.  Attached hereto, please find one (1) responsive record.  I have also provided three (3) links below for your reference.\r\n\r\nCriminal Conduct | Human Resources | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<https://www.pa.gov/agencies/hrmoa/programs/employee-relations/criminal-conduct.html#:~:text=The%20Governor%27s%20Code%20of%20Conduct,must%20be%20suspended%20without%20pay.>\r\n\r\nDiscipline | Human Resources | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<https://www.pa.gov/agencies/hrmoa/programs/employee-relations/discipline.html>\r\n\r\nEmployee Relations Policies and Laws | Human Resources | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<https://www.pa.gov/agencies/hrmoa/programs/employee-relations/policies-laws.html>\r\n\r\nPlease know that you have the right to appeal this response by writing to the Office of Open Records, 333 Market Street, 16th Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17101-2234.  Should you wish to file an appeal you must do so within fifteen (15) days of the mailing date of the agency's response.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nZachary Fahnestock\r\nAgency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Chief Counsel\r\nPennsylvania Game Commission\r\n2001 Elmerton Avenue\r\nHarrisburg, PA 17110",

However, based on some of the web search results I found, it seems that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries, unless there is a clear causal link between the two\u00b2. For example, in Minnesota, a mental injury that results from a physical injury (such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder) may be compensable, but a mental injury that does not have a physical component (such as emotional distress or anxiety) may not be\u2074. Similarly, in product liability cases, courts have been more likely to award damages for mental anguish if the plaintiff suffered a physical injury or was exposed to a substantial risk of physical harm by the defective product\u00b2. Therefore, it seems that courts have generally favored a more objective and tangible approach to assessing damages, rather than a subjective and intangible one. However, this may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each case, as well as the applicable law and precedent.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Damages & Compensation for Mental Anguish in a Personal Injury ... - AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/damages-compensation-mental-aguish.html.\r\n(2) Mental vs. Physical Work Injuries (How Do They Differ?). https://mottazsiskinjurylaw.com/physical-vs-mental-work-injury/.\r\n(3) Damages and Compensation in a Personal Injury Lawsuit | AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/types-of-compensation.html.\r\n(4) Bodily Injury vs Personal Injury (Differences Explained). https://www.schmidtandclark.com/bodily-injury-vs-personal-injury.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. \u201cThen-Chief Judge Howell recently used an \"objective metric\"-Veterans Affairs disability ratings-to guide her in departing from the Heiser awards. See Schooley v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 17-cv-1376, 2019 WL 2717888, at ~7475 (D.D.C. June 27, 2019). VA disability ratings are \"a specialized agency s official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\" Id. at 74 ( cleaned up). Because VA ratings roll mental and physical injuries into one number, they facilitate a more objective approach to awarding damages. This is so because courts need not weigh whether certain injuries merit more money than others. See id.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for your message. It seems that you are interested in the use of VA disability ratings as a way of determining damages for mental and physical injuries in cases involving terrorism. Based on the web search results I found, VA disability ratings are a system that evaluates the degree of disability caused by service-connected conditions for veterans. The ratings range from 0% to 100%, and they affect the amount of monthly compensation and other benefits that veterans receive\u00b9\u00b2. VA disability ratings are based on the evidence submitted by the veterans or obtained from military records, and they may include a VA medical examination in some cases\u00b2.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using VA disability ratings as an objective metric for awarding damages is that they provide a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the veterans' ability to function and earn income. They also avoid the need for courts to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify\u00b3. Furthermore, VA disability ratings reflect the official determination of a specialized agency that has expertise and experience in dealing with service-related disabilities\u2074.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may also be some limitations and challenges in applying VA disability ratings to non-veterans or to injuries that are not service-connected. For example, VA disability ratings may not capture the full extent of the pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of enjoyment of life that victims of terrorism may experience. They may also not account for the differences in individual circumstances, such as age, education, occupation, or family situation, that may affect the severity and duration of the injuries. Additionally, VA disability ratings may not be available or reliable for some victims, especially those who are not U.S. citizens or residents, or those who have not sought or received medical treatment or diagnosis for their injuries\u2074.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while VA disability ratings may offer a useful and objective tool for assessing damages for mental and physical injuries in some cases, they may not be sufficient or appropriate for all cases. Courts may need to consider other factors and sources of evidence, such as expert testimony, medical records, personal statements, or witness accounts, to determine the fair and reasonable amount of compensation for each victim\u2074.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) 2023 Veterans Disability Compensation Rates | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/.\r\n(2) About VA Disability Ratings | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/about-disability-ratings/.\r\n(3) VACI's 2023 VA Disability Calculator - VA Claims Insider. https://vaclaimsinsider.com/va-disability-rating-calculator/.\r\n(4) Veterans\u2019 Benefits Rating and Rates | ChooseVA. https://choose.va.gov/disability/ratings-and-rates.\r\n(5) VA Math - How Combined VA Disability Ratings Are Calculated. https://themilitarywallet.com/va-math-combined-disability-ratings/.\u201d\r\n\r\n6. \u201cgiven \"that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries\" could it be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is incredibly significant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is an interesting question. I am not a legal expert, but based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b9 awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant in several ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, it shows that the court recognized the severity and impact of the mental injuries suffered by the plaintiffs, who were victims of a terrorist attack, and did not discount or diminish their claims based on the lack of physical injuries or evidence. The court stated that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are no less real than their physical injuries, and no less deserving of compensation.\\\"\u00b9 The court also noted that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are not merely transient or fleeting, but rather chronic and enduring, affecting their daily lives and relationships for years after the attack.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nSecond, it shows that the court applied an objective metric, namely the VA disability ratings, to determine the relative degree of injury suffered by each service-member plaintiff. The court explained that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating is a specialized agency's official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\\\"\u00b9 The court also stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating provides a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the plaintiffs' ability to function and earn income.\\\"\u00b9 The court further stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating avoids the need for this Court to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nThird, it shows that the court followed the precedent set by other cases involving victims of terrorism, such as Akins v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b2, where the court also awarded damages based on the VA disability ratings. The court in Schooley cited Akins as an example of a case where \\\"the plaintiffs' mental injuries were compensable even though they did not suffer any physical injuries as a result of the terrorist attack.\\\"\u00b9 The court in Schooley also noted that \\\"[t]he use of VA disability ratings as a measure of damages is consistent with other cases in this district involving victims of terrorism.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nTherefore, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant because it demonstrates the court's recognition, objectivity, and consistency in compensating victims of terrorism for their mental and physical injuries.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Schooley v.

The handbook establishes workplace policies, procedures and protocols for creating and implementing guidance for all VA programs and activities consistent with the changes to the Rehabilitation Act required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008, which reinstated the broad scope of individuals protected under the ADA and Section 504\u00b9. The handbook also outlines the roles and responsibilities of various VA offices and officials in ensuring compliance with Section 504, as well as the procedures for handling complaints, appeals, and enforcement actions related to disability discrimination\u00b9. The handbook is intended to help VA foster optimal organizational environments to protect the rights of beneficiaries, with disabilities, of VA programs or activities\u00b9.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTING SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1134&FType=2.\r\n(2) Department of Veterans Affairs VA DIRECTIVE 6500 February 24, 2021 VA .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1254&FType=2.\r\n(3) Blind Justice-VA Vet Center Update - Auditors United. https://auditorsunited.org/a/2023/03/25/blind-justice-va-vet-center-update/.\r\n(4) Department of Veterans Affairs VA HANDBOOK 6500 February 24, 2021 RISK .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1255&FType=2.\u201d\r\n\r\n8. \u201ccould it be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a hypothetical question that may depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. However, based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination if it results in denying or limiting the access, benefits, or opportunities of qualified individuals with disabilities to any program or activity operated by the federal agency. According to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u2074, which prohibits discrimination based on disability in any program or activity operated by recipients of federal funds or conducted by a federal agency, discrimination may include:\r\n\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Denying a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services;\r\n- Affording a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services that is not equal to that afforded others;\r\n- Providing a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Otherwise limiting a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefits, or services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if an employee of a federal agency intentionally provides false or misleading information about a program or activity that affects the rights, privileges, advantages, or opportunities of individuals with disabilities, it could be considered a form of discrimination under Section 504. However, this would have to be proven by evidence and may be subject to legal defenses and exceptions.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) HHS Issues New Proposed Rule to Strengthen Prohibitions Against .... https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/07/hhs-issues-new-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-prohibitions-against-discrimination-on-basis-of-disability-in-health-care-and-human-services-programs.html.\r\n(2) Employment Laws: Disability & Discrimination - U.S. Department of Labor. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/publications/fact-sheets/employment-laws-disability-and-discrimination.\r\n(3) Disability Discrimination: Overview of the Laws - U.S. Department of .... https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/guid/ocr/disabilityoverview.html.\r\n(4) Disability Discrimination - U.S. Department of Education. https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/pro-students/disability-pr.html.\u201d\n",

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?\r\n\r\n26.   The VA already has a similar option called a \u201crefunding.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx\r\n\r\n27.   Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.

From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n30.   As I understand it, the VASP is set to be introduced at \u201c\u2026.the beginning of October\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n31.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ubxwuoe4rxoc2j80mrfo/Automated-Decision-Support-VBA-Home-Loans.pdf?rlkey=rs0pnc6x8j9lmm194fgiq9ez9&dl=0\r\n\r\n32.   There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct.

You said \u201c\u2026we can only discuss loss mitt options vaguely\u2026\u201d and I can only surmise you\u2019re pulling from the m26-3(4.03)(c) as it says \u201cTechnicians should determine if contact with a borrower is required during the AOS process.  If contact information in VALERI is no longer valid or numbers provided are not in service, the loan technician must attempt to locate a working number using an online search engine or other available search options and document the case notes.  If a borrower is in active bankruptcy or was active in bankruptcy during the default, no contact should be initiated with the borrower.  If the borrower initiates contact with VA, the technician should only discuss general information regarding the loan and the VA Home Loan Program and document a summary of the conversation in the case notes.\u201d Given the full context of m26-3(4.03)(c), speaking \u201cvaguely\u201d or \u201cgenerally\u201d only applies when a VA Home Loan technician is conducting an Adequacy of Servicing review.

Your loan is in active bankruptcy with Plant Home Lending and while you are under the protection of the Bankruptcy Courts and engaging with Planet Home Lending through the legal process of Bankruptcy we are unable to interfere with that legal process.  If you have questions regarding your loan while it is in bankruptcy we encourage you to discuss it with your bankruptcy attorney and the judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou did get a Relief of Stay from the courts to discuss loss mitt options, we can only discuss loss mitt options vaguely because your loan is still under the protection of the Bankruptcy Court.  We have tried to discuss loss mitt options with you, by inquiring if your ex-wife would be willing to execute/sign an agreement. You had previously informed the USB office that she is unwilling to sign which does impact your loss mitt options.

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys96eAuPQ$>\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys96eAuPQ$>\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys-d0gD9U$>\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysC7e0pl8$>?\r\n\r\n26.

Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.   He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n29.   From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys2Kd6U-g$>\r\n\r\n30.

The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims.

There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct.

From what I can tell, the additional commentary period was requested due to MBA/HPC being completely in the dark regarding a \u201cwritten program description, outline or framework\u201d for VASP.  The request for an additional commentary period is interesting considering it could be argued that MBA/HPC have commented on VASP already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing from Brendan Kelleher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Juan Valdez <jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org<mailto:jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 1:32 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: RE: GCR Referral - VASP Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with you on both things; first, mandatory means required, and second, this is a huge deal for the community. However, I don\u2019t believe the link to the \u201cLoss-Mitigation Options for Guaranteed Loans\u201d link is the correct link for the VASP. Mainly because MBA is asking for a period of public comment instead of a reopening of it. Moreover, the link already had the comment period close in January of 2023. Meanwhile, MBA is asking for a public comment period in their July 26 letter. I noticed that you copied Brendan Kelleher; did he respond to your e-mail outside of what you\u2019ve sent me thus far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding your question about the 147,000 default home loans, unfortunately, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d speculate that not very many of them are equipped to handle this given that they\u2019re already in a stressful financial situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to say thank you for handing me this puzzle.

It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysq8bMT2w$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysWFVPPRk$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYyspIx6wwc$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The VA already has a similar option called a \u201crefunding.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4*20Chapter*209*20Refunds*20-*205-2017.docx__;JSUlJSU!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysH4oxF-o$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to recap, the program was supposed to be implemented on 7/1/2023, but wasn\u2019t. The VA hasn\u2019t shared anything specific with the groups representing mortgage companies. There are potentially as many as 147,000 veteran homeowners at risk of losing their homes and are most likely completely unaware of this new program.  The number of loans/mortgages potentially considered under the program is a number the VA (in my opinion) is not at all equipped to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Juan Valdez <jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org<mailto:jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org>>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2023 4:22 PM\r\nTo: mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com> <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: GCR Referral - VASP Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://app.salesforceiq.com/t.png?c=outlook&t=AFwhZf2HRzOX2wavcs3oNbv6sa5Jyt-GRZO48MjO7-Pj-WPNiS-nRWkHyHdNeOy-N01bNHcnxBPK2JVwqonW3JtFJo-jY4iajTm16ug2RCFrFeMhZwk9C5lTrvCVlz539f2GMQGesXKT]Hi Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you\u2019re having a great week.

Specifically, the portion that states \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  My understanding is that based on the plain writing,  \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d is a compound-complex sentence that has two independent clauses (VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy and VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim) joined by a coordinating conjunction (however) and one dependent clause (if the borrower reaches out to VA) that modifies the second independent clause. The second independent clause means that VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement if the borrower reaches out to VA. The phrase \u201cshould the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u201d is a conditional clause that describes a possible scenario that would result in the loss of entitlement for the borrower. It does not imply that VA will only discuss options and entitlements in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The VA employee I\u2019ve engaged with to this point has stated \u201cAt this this time, your loan has not terminated and therefore we cannot \u2018discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. When pressed for further clarification on the provided interpretation, the employee declined to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan this office (or someone within the VA with expertise regarding \u201cplain writing\u201d) please provide input on the plain writing meaning of \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 24, 2023 10:45 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>; Krejci, Louis, VBAPHNX <Louis.Krejci@va.gov<mailto:Louis.Krejci@va.gov>>\r\nCc: SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>; VA Hotline <VAHotline@va.gov<mailto:VAHotline@va.gov>>; Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; Jeffrey Badgley <jbadgley@badgleylawgroup.com<mailto:jbadgley@badgleylawgroup.com>>; Jon Masters <jmasters@badgleylawgroup.com<mailto:jmasters@badgleylawgroup.com>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Case No. 11190053 Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

You say \u201cVA\u2019s system was unable to reflect all the necessary changes for the COVID pandemic.  Unfortunately, VA had to spend it resources building out the Partial Claim program.  So, while the servicer was updating the VA regarding the forbearances, unfortunately our system is not able to identify if was a CARES Act forbearance or a regular forbearance.  Home Lending reported to VA a special forbearance was added from 8/19/20 \u2013 11/1/20. This doesn\u2019t mean more special forbearances weren\u2019t completed with Planet Home Lending, this is all that was reported to VA during this time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Further, I know your statement is nonsense (if not an outright lie) based on the VALERI loan information and notes provided pursuant to my 5/17/2022 FOIA request. Said records clearly demonstrate whatever forbearance entered by Planet Home Lending in VALERI was done in accordance with VA Circular 26-20-17. You're free to review those records via the link below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysSLjR8Lw$> [https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

VA will be unable to assist as this appears to be an action against your servicer and we are unable to participate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The U.S. Congress has put in place a number of laws and practices to favor veterans as it relates to receiving benefits from the VA. This includes 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which requires the VA to help the claimant develop their claim for benefits. Furthermore, under Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed.2d 462, any interpretive doubt is to be resolved in favor of the veteran, as seen in the case of Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. On one hand you say that the VA is unable to discuss loss mitigation options, yet here you attempt to indirectly discuss loss mitigation options by stating and asking \"You had advised 'The Veteran said that even if his loan servicer provided him a package to keep the home his ex-wife would not sign off on that because she wants him to sell the home.'  Is this still the case?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Why does the apparent CARES ACT information in VALERI as provided by Marcus Young not align with the information provided by servicer Planet Home Lending in their CFPB complaint response?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Will the VA please uphold it\u2019s duty to assist and obtain copies of servicer Planet Home Lending\u2019s \u201ccollection records\u201d from 5/01/2020 to 8/16/2022?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Is the VA a servicer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 6. Is the VA a servicer to my home loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Does the \u201cguidance\u201d you provided directly state the VA is prevented from speaking with a veteran borrower with a home under the protection of a bankruptcy court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Are you saying the \u201cguidance\u201d states the only time that the VA can engage with a veteran borrower regarding a home loan subject to the protection of the bankruptcy courts is after that loan terminates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. How is it possible for a loan to terminate that\u2019s subject to the protection of the bankruptcy court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d is a compound-complex sentence that has two independent clauses (VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy and VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim) joined by a coordinating conjunction (however) and one dependent clause (if the borrower reaches out to VA) that modifies the second independent clause. The second independent clause means that VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement if the borrower reaches out to VA. The phrase \u201cshould the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u201d is a conditional clause that describes a possible scenario that would result in the loss of entitlement for the borrower. It does not imply that VA will only discuss options and entitlements in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysq8bMT2w$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysnT2_ixo$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysC7e0pl8$>?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiduciary relationships may be implied in law and such relationships are premised upon the specific factual situation surrounding the transaction, as well as the relationship of the parties.

Of course, you may disregard this request but moving forward we will only be responding to this communication chain.\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the 46 items that you have identified below, and we determined responded to them previously in prior responses (which we can provide again) or there is no action for us to respond.  If there are ones that are new that we have not responded to feel free to let us know the specific ones and we will review and respond.\r\n\r\nAs for the inquiry in the Bankruptcy guidance, you have failed to provide the full guidance.  Please review the full guidance below and understand that we must comply with the full guidance.\r\n\r\nWhen a borrower files for bankruptcy protection, servicers are typically prevented from making contact.  Servicers must report the bankruptcy events in VALERI to include the type of bankruptcy (Chapter 7, 11 or 13 filing) and provide updates such as relief filed, relief granted, dismissed, or discharged.  VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\r\n\r\nAt this this time, your loan has not terminated and therefore we cannot \u201cdiscuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs for your request to engage with our attorneys, they do not engage directly with Veterans but through us.  If you have a specific question, we can reach out to them and request them provide us guidance.\r\n\r\nWe are also in receipt of your inquiry into the VASP program.  VA has not publicly announced this program and does have not a confirmed date for which a new program will be announced.  Implementation of new programs may take many months as the mortgage industry has to adapt policies and technology to any changes made to the VA Home Loan program.\r\n\r\nAgain, as we have advised you before you can either continue to argue our policies with us or you can begin to work with us and try to resolve your home loan delinquency once the debt is out of the protection of the Bankruptcy courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 8:58 PM\r\nTo: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSubject: Re: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a technical legal question that I don\u2019t know the answer to, but since it requires a servicing transfer (which is a highly technical process that requires cooperation), and the purchase of the loan from the servicer, the servicer would almost certainly need to consent to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe servicer or the VA-assigned technician may initiate the refund consideration process at any time during the life of the loan.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4*20Chapter*209*20Refunds*20-*205-2017.docx__;JSUlJSU!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysH4oxF-o$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDefinitely not my understanding as the program currently works.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce all required documentation is received from the servicer and borrower, and the VA appraisal has been completed, VA will conduct an analysis and complete a refund decision process.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the previous link. Granted, federal courts have found federal agency manuals have no \u201clegal force\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, but my understanding is that there are currently no loss mitigation options that a servicer must offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA circular 26-20-12 was rescinded on 7/1/2021, so it's not in effect anymore. For the time that it was, technically the VA Disaster Loan Modification and VA Streamline Modification would be an issue based on the wording that servicers were to \u201c\u2026ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current.\u201d They both use a trial payment plan in the place of a traditional loan modification packet.The streamline \u201cModification must realize at least a 10% reduction in principal and interest portion of the payment,\u201d so it\u2019s a little more strenuous than the disaster. I think part of the difference between the refund and VASP is servicers being \u201cmade whole,\u201d but it seems like the VA would have a good argument against making a servicer whole if a servicer failed to follow VA Circular 26-20-12. Granted, based on my experience, the VA seems deferential to what \u201cyou guys\u201d want, but it\u2019s still the federal government and I imagine they don\u2019t want to pay out money if they don\u2019t have to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe new program would be mandatory, and instead of a couple dozen of loans a year, it could be tens of thousands. There are a whole lot of other changes, but those are two big ones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you say \u201cmandatory,\u201d do you mean that the VA will require servicers to refer defaulted home loans where no other loss mitigation options are possible to the VA for VASP consideration? I know the VA started using \u201cAI\u201d to process disability benefit claims about a year before chatgpt was introduced, had considerable success, and expanded the \u201cpilot program.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019d be that hard to extend that to processing VASP consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nd From: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 7:48 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nCc: Kelleher, Brendan <bkelleher@mba.org<mailto:bkelleher@mba.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow in red are my best answers to your questions.

Your July 26, 2023 joint letter states in part \u201c\u2018As we understand VASP, the decision to modify a borrower's loan rests with the VA,\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Yet, servicers continue to evaluate their borrowers for all available options. In other words, servicers continue to communicate and engage with their delinquent borrowers until the VA approves the purchase of the loan and accepts transfer of the loan from the servicer.\u2019 This dynamic \u2018dislocates the traditional regulatory relationship between the servicer and the borrower.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan\u2019t the current VA refund process be initiated by the VA without the consent of the servicer? That is a technical legal question that I don\u2019t know the answer to, but since it requires a servicing transfer (which is a highly technical process that requires cooperation), and the purchase of the loan from the servicer, the servicer would almost certainly need to consent to it.\r\n\r\n Ultimately, isn\u2019t it solely the decision of the VA as to whether or not a loan will be refunded? Definitely not my understanding as the program currently works.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s different between the old refund and VASP? The new program would be mandatory, and instead of a couple dozen of loans a year, it could be tens of thousands. There are a whole lot of other changes, but those are two big ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d That\u2019s right, but my understanding is that there are currently no loss mitigation options that a servicer must offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Subsection c of section 5 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on # 2 and 3, do you guys have any information detailing compliance with VA Circular 26-20-12? Nope-no information on this.\r\n\r\nVA Circular 26-20-12 was in place from 4/9/2020 until 7/1/2021. In that time, what number of defaulted VA home loans were referred to the VA for possible refunding pursuant to 26-20-12? Haven\u2019t seen a number on this, but based on verbal information from the VA I would guess less than 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, do you guys represent Planet Home Lending? The Housing Policy Council does not represent Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 1:49 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nCc: Kelleher, Brendan <bkelleher@mba.org<mailto:bkelleher@mba.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they have not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.

The VA has a disaster loan mitigation option that could have been applied, but Planet Home Lending did not offer it. The CARES Act was signed in March 2020 and offered protection to homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government who are facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explicitly states that mortgage assistance must be provided regardless of delinquency status. The VA then issued a circular on April 8, 2020 that stated servicers have to give borrowers the opportunity to pursue all loss mitigation options to bring their loan current. The VA also issued a circular in July 2021 that introduced the COVID- 19 Refund Modification which allows for significant payment reductions and does not require a financial evaluation. Despite this, Planet Home Lending began court proceedings to obtain a foreclosure, and only offered a loan modification with a trial payment period in December 2021, which could have been done at any point during the default period. I rejected the modification offer due to the applicable laws and regulations that favor the veteran, such as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A and Brown v. Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I currently have a VA home loan through Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n2. In September of 2019 the area the property is located was under a mandatory evacuation due to Hurricane Dorian. The area was declared a federal disaster area in December of 2019.\r\n\r\n3. In 10/1/2019 I missed the first home loan payment.\r\n\r\n4. In December of 2019 I submitted an incomplete loss mitigation package to Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n5. On 1/3/2020 I was denied consideration for any loss mitigation options by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n6. The VA has a disaster loss mitigation option that allows for a loan modification absent a complete loss mitigation package.\r\n\r\n7. The VA disaster loan modification specifies a trial payment plan is used to verify income in lieu of a complete loss mitigation package.\r\n\r\n8. Planet Home Lending had the ability to offer a VA Disaster Loan Modification and/or a special forbearance at this point, but does not.\r\n\r\n9. In early 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic begins.\r\n\r\n10. On 3/27/2020, THE CARES ACT is signed into law.\r\n\r\n11. The CARES Act offers protection to homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government who are facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explicitly states in section 4022(b)(1) that mortgage assistance provided pursuant to the CARES ACT was to be provided \"...regardless of delinquency status.\"\r\n\r\n12. The Department of Veterans Affairs makes use of circulars issued via the official VA website to provide current policies and procedures to VA-approved lenders and servicers.\r\n\r\n13. The VA explicitly states via their official website that circulars are supplemental to VA home loan regulations.\r\n\r\n14. On 4/8/2020, the VA issues \u201cCircular 26-20-12\u201d via the official VA website in response to the CARES ACT.\r\n\r\n15. Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n16. I was eligible for a disaster loan modification for the entirety of my default period, but at no point was I offered a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n17. As a result of section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12, Planet Home Lending was required to offer a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Planet Home Lending continues to maintain that I was ineligible for any loss mitigation options, then the following applies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Section 3 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cThe borrower, not the servicer, is entitled to determine the period of the forbearance...\u201d\r\n\r\n19. Planet Home Lending stated the following regarding forbearance applied to my home loan:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n20. Subsection c of section 5 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n21. No such review was conducted or documented within the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI).\r\n\r\n22. The VA via 38 CFR \u00a7 36.4301 defines \u201chome equity\u201d as \u201c...the difference between the home's reasonable value and the outstanding balance of all liens on the property.\u201d\r\n\r\n23. The VA via 38 CFR \u00a7 36.4301 defines \u201creasonable value\u201d as \u201c...that figure which represents the amount a reputable and qualified appraiser, unaffected by personal interest, bias, or prejudice, would recommend to a prospective purchaser as a proper price or cost in the light of prevailing conditions.\u201d\r\n\r\n24. Per the applicable appraisal on file with the VA and Planet Home Lending, the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the home was/is $292,000.\r\n\r\n25. At the time of default, the principal balance of the home was $263,329.99.\r\n\r\n26. If the first forbearance period expired in August of 2020 and no loss mitigation options were possible, in July of 2020 Planet Home Lending was required to refer the home loan to the applicable VA Regional Loan Center for possible refunding, as there was no way the outstanding balance of the home exceeded the \u201creasonable value\u201d of $292,000.\r\n\r\n27. At no time did Planet Home lending refer the home loan to the applicable VA Regional Loan Center for possible refunding.\r\n\r\n28. On 7/1/2021, VA Circular 26-20-12 is rescinded.\r\n\r\n29. On 7/23/2021 the VA issues Circular 26-21-13.\r\n\r\n30. The purpose of VA Circular 26-21-13 is to provide \u201c...VA\u2019s waterfall of home retention options for helping borrowers affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\r\n\r\n31. VA Circular 26-21-13 also \u201c...announces the COVID-19 Refund Modification, a type of loan modification specific to those borrowers needing payment reductions when exiting COVID-19 forbearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n32. While section 5 of VA Circular 26-21-13 identifies eligibility criteria for borrowers to whom the home retention waterfall will apply, no such eligibility criteria is provided for the COVID-19 Refund Modification. It should be noted that Planet Home Lending presently reflects the last payment received on the loan as 1/1/2020.\r\n\r\n33. The COVID-19 Refund Modification is a type of loan modification that allows for significant reductions in a borrower's monthly payments. The indebtedness is secured as a junior lien in favor of VA that does not accrue interest or require monthly payments, and only becomes due when the property is sold, the loan is paid off, or the loan is refinanced. VA can purchase indebtedness up to 30 percent of a borrower's unpaid principal balance, and does not require a financial evaluation for every case.\r\n\r\n34. On 9/30/21 Planet Home Lending begins court proceedings to obtain a foreclosure.\r\n\r\n 35. On 11/4/2021 Isubmits a complete loss mitigation package to Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n36. On 12/27/2021 Planet Home Lending puts forth an offer for \u201cStandard Modification\u201d (ie Traditional Loan modification) with a trial payment period.\r\n\r\n37. Besides in name, the offer is a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n38. Due to the proceeding facts, I rejected the loan modification as it could have been offered at any time within the default period.\r\n\r\n39. The U.S. Congress has put in place a number of laws and practices to favor veterans as it relates to receiving benefits from the VA. This includes 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which requires the VA to help the claimant develop their claim for benefits. Furthermore, under Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed.2d 462, any interpretive doubt is to be resolved in favor of the veteran, as seen in the case of Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\n40. Per 38 USC \u00a7 5103A, the VA \u201c...shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant\u2019s claim for a benefit under a law administered by the Secretary.\u201d\r\n\r\n41. The VA home loan benefit is authorized by Title 38, Chapter 37 of the United States Code.\r\n\r\n42. The VA has a duty to assist my claims for benefits related to my home loan.\r\n\r\n43. The VA was and is aware of the issues described herein.\r\n\r\n44. The VA failed and refused to act concerning those issues.\r\n\r\n45. I was forced to declare bankruptcy due to the VA\u2019s failure and refusal to act.\r\n\r\n46. The home is in delinquency due to the VA\u2019s failure and refusal to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>\r\nSent: Friday, July 8, 2022 9:35 AM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will follow up with the Phoenix Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, July 7, 2022 11:06 PM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, the following hasn\u2019t been explained by the VA:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom: Michael Locke\r\n\r\nSent: Thursday, June 23, 2022 3:04 PM\r\nTo: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@VA.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@VA.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov> <marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain the discrepancies between what VA Phoenix Regional Loan Center Loan Administration Officer Marcus Young is saying and what my servicer is saying? I will most likely have further questions based on the answers I receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cYour loan was reported in default to the VA and due for the 10/1/19 installment. The reason for default was martial difficulties. When we talked to you on August 14, 2020, you confirmed that the reason for default was martial difficulties. According to our notes, you submitted a loss mitigation assistance application in 2019, however the servicer deemed the application incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlanet\u2019s investigation revealed that you initially submitted an online portal inquiry on December 3, 2019. The submission was partially completed, however, did not indicate whether the disaster hardship was resolved or ongoing. Planet issued both acknowledgement and missing items letters (enclosed) on that same date. To proceed with a Disaster Modification, Planet must verify that the hardship was resolved, the borrower returned to work and with no negative long-term change in the household income occurring. Despite numerous attempts, we did not receive the required information. Therefore, on January 3, 2020, a loss mitigation denial letter (enclosed) was issued.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. I responded to the proceeding as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the above what is reflected in VALERI? If so, does this mean I have CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance eligibility remaining? If so, why didn\u2019t the VA intervene at the time Planet Home Lending filed for foreclosure and say I had eligibility remaining? Planet Home Lending has provided conflicting information regarding the forbearance dates. Will the VA please clarify with Planet Home Lending the dates where CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance was applied to the property, as well as request and provide all documentation substantiating as much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Mr Young responded to the proceeding with the following:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2022 Repayment Plan: Approved: 8/19/20, start date: 5/1/20 estimated cure date: 10/1/20\r\n\r\n\u2022 Special Forbearance Plan: Approved: 8/19/20 estimated cure date: 11/1/20.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u2018In May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, July 5, 2022 11:26 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll loss mitigation package documents were submitted to Planet Home Lending as of 6/26/2022.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, July 5, 2022 10:22 AM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning Mr. Locke,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have responded to this inquiry previously in the official correspondence that has been sent to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Locke you have two options, 1) you can start working with VA and your servicer to resolve your delinquency or discuss an alternative to foreclosure, or 2) you can continue to argue with VA about policies and regulations at which we will not be responding because we have already provided you our response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Saturday, July 2, 2022 10:05 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer Marcus Young \u201cUnderstand at this point they have allowed for the authorized amount of time under the COVID FB requirement, they can consider extending forbearance if you qualify for an extended FB.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Planet Home Lending version of events is accepted, Planet Home Lending was required and failed to refer the loan to the VA for refunding in July of 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current.

During the COVID-19 national emergency the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through its home loan program, continues to work toward keeping Veterans and stakeholders safe. On March 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), Public Law 116-136. The CARES Act protects borrowers with Federally backed mortgage loans who are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 national emergency. These protections are outlined below. The servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer. The Cares Act preempts section 3 of Circular 26-20-7, 'Special Relief for those Potentially Impacted by COVID-19.'\" See VA Circular 26-20-12(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

So what gives?\r\n[image/jpeg]\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would logically follow if these questions had been answered previously, you would have simply said as much, like you did with the first question asked on 11/16/2023.\r\n\r\nI take your non-response concerning the duty to assist request to mean VBA Loan Guaranty is refusing the request.\r\n\r\nBecause they didn\u2019t follow VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe my servicer anything, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to figure out.\r\n\r\nI was married to a former DCF/CPS investigator/supervisor. You read that and you think whatever,  but what I mean is that child abused investigators for the state have no legal authority and generally have to BS to close out cases. When a report comes in and they go out to investigate, they generally don\u2019t have a warrant or enough to get a warrant, but they still have to close out their cases. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is or what their socioeconomic status is, no one is initially cooperative when a child abuse investigator shows up at their doorstep. So truth be told, they have to be pretty good at BSing. From what I experienced and what the spouses of other child abuse investigators substantiated, it\u2019s hard to turn off the exploitative BS when you come home. They have to do it so much, it becomes second nature. Most child abuse investigators burnout within a year. My ex did it for 9. Beyond that, she\u2019s 99.99th percentile IQ. Way smarter than me, and I imagine you as well. All of this is to say, I\u2019ve been well trained to deal with this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASP is still going to be a thing, correct? Even so, I\u2019m not counting on that. I\u2019m counting on the circumstances that spurred the NPR investigation aren\u2019t going to change. \u201cA tiger can\u2019t change its stripes,\u201d as the saying goes.\r\n\r\nBecause my servicer didn\u2019t follow VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe my servicer anything, and because you guys didn\u2019t ensure my servicer followed VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe the VA anything either.\r\n\nMichael Locke",

According to a study by Casetext and Stanford CodeX, GPT-4 scored approximately 297 points on the UBE, which is higher than the passing threshold for all UBE jurisdictions. This score places GPT-4 in the 90th percentile of test-takers.\r\n\r\nI am a pro se litigant who is interested in using Casetext's CoCounsel to prepare and file legal documents for my case. I understand that Casetext's CoCounsel does not provide legal advice or representation, and that I am solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of my documents.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned that using Casetext's CoCounsel may be considered the unlicensed practice of law under Rule 10-2.1 of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, which defines the practice of law as \"the giving of legal advice or legal assistance to another person\". I am also aware that Rule 10-9.1 allows the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law to issue proposed formal advisory opinions concerning activities which may constitute the unlicensed practice of law.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I respectfully request that the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law issue a formal advisory opinion on whether pro se use of Casetext's CoCounsel would constitute the unlicensed practice of law in Florida.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n127 Delvalle St.\r\nMelbourne Beach, FL 32951\r\nMbl22885@msn.com<mailto:Mbl22885@msn.com>\r\n(321)506-9557<tel:(321)506-9557>\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm reaching out to propose an enhancement to the legal support services offered to our veterans through VA hospital legal clinics. Since 2019, Thomson Reuters has provided their legal research products to the Federal Judiciary. Recently, on January 3, 2024, their contract was updated to incorporate Westlaw Precision, a tool enriched by AI capabilities, suggesting that its innovative AI-assisted features were a significant factor in the contract's renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe integration of Westlaw Precision has revolutionized legal research by enabling professionals to conduct searches using conversational language and receive comprehensive, AI-generated responses. This has greatly improved the efficiency of legal research, drawing from a robust collection of legal documents for accurate, authoritative results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the apparent reliability of Precision due to its use by the federal courts, I believe our veterans would greatly benefit from similar access through the VA's legal clinics. This would provide them with unparalleled support in navigating their legal challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how we could extend this advanced legal research capability to our veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke",

Given that the VA recognizes the necessity of such a comprehensive legal research tool for its own use in adjudicating claims and legal analysis, it could be argued that veterans should also have access to similar resources to adequately prepare and support their claims.

        "communication": "The argument that the VA's use of specialized legal research tools like those provided by West Publishing Corporation is essential for resolving benefits issues and that similar resources should be made available to veterans to ensure equity and informed decision-making is compelling. This approach aligns with the VA's duty to assist veterans in preparing and substantiating their claims, as outlined in 38 USC \u00a7 5103A. Here are excerpts from relevant case law that support various aspects of this argument:\r\n\r\n  1.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA): The VCAA, codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, mandates the VA to assist veterans in developing their claims for benefits. This assistance includes obtaining records relevant to the claim and providing medical examinations when necessary for decision-making on the claim. The case of David R. Gagne v. Robert A. McDonald illustrates the VA's obligation under the VCAA to make reasonable efforts to assist claimants, highlighting the importance of access to comprehensive resources for claim development??.\r\n\r\n  2.  Duty to Assist in Obtaining Evidence: The VA's duty to assist includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records that can help substantiate a veteran's claim. This principle is further elaborated in Golz v. Shinseki, where the court affirmed the VA's duty to assist as found in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, emphasizing the pro-claimant system and the requirement to develop the veteran's claim fully and sympathetically??.\r\n\r\n  3.  Relevance and Reasonable Efforts: The case of Sullivan v. McDonald discusses the VA's duty to assist in obtaining records, noting that this duty extends only to potentially relevant records. This underscores the necessity for access to tools that can help identify and analyze relevant legal and factual information to support claims??.\r\n\r\n  4.  Empowering Veterans with Information: The argument for providing veterans with access to legal research tools mirrors the VA's duty to assist, as it equips veterans with the necessary information to actively participate in the adjudication of their claims. Cases like Charles v. Principi highlight the VCAA's impact in eliminating the well-grounded-claim requirement and expanding the VA's duty to assist, which can be seen as supporting the broader principle of empowering claimants with information and resources??.\r\n\r\nThese cases illustrate the legal framework underpinning the VA's duty to assist veterans in preparing and substantiating their claims and highlight the importance of access to comprehensive information and resources, both for the VA and veterans. Extending access to specialized legal research tools to veterans can be seen as a natural extension of the VA's duty to assist, promoting equity and informed participation in the claims process.\n",

It is a direct and unavoidable consequence of the court-ordered sale, which itself was based on the inaccurate assertion that my property was at imminent risk of foreclosure. As I've repeatedly explained, this inaccurate assessment resulted from the VA's failure to properly oversee Planet Home Lending and to investigate discrepancies in the reported forbearance timelines. Please note that I have filed a formal appeal with the Board of Veterans' Appeals on June 12, 2024, challenging these and other failures by the VA. A copy of my appeal is attached for your review.\r\nThe June 13, 2022 court order (Exhibit 10, p. 5, para. G) explicitly states that the sale proceeds are to be used to satisfy the remaining balance of the equalizing payment owed to my ex-wife due to the pending foreclosure. This payment would not be required if not for the court-ordered sale, which itself would not have occurred had the VA fulfilled its oversight and assistance obligations.\r\nFurthermore, my ex-wife has stated in writing (Exhibit 11) that she is willing to allow me to retain the home if the $27,000 payment is made. This demonstrates that the payment is the only obstacle preventing me from keeping my home.\r\nAdditionally, your letter refers to a \"special forbearance\" being approved in August 2020. To be clear, my requests for forbearance during this period were specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It appears the VA is not properly recognizing or documenting these COVID-19 forbearances, further demonstrating their failure to comply with their own regulations and guidance.\r\nFrankly, I'm deeply disturbed by the VA's attempt to rewrite the history of my loan and to downplay the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on my situation. Until the VA demonstrates a genuine commitment to accuracy, transparency, and accountability in its oversight of my loan, I cannot engage in any further discussions or attempts to resolve this matter in good faith. I expect the VA to acknowledge and address its failures, not to obfuscate the truth and shift blame.\r\nI request a prompt and thorough review of this matter, in light of my attached BVA appeal, and a response that directly addresses the specific points I have raised.\r\nSincerely,\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSent: Tuesday, June 25, 2024 2:09 PM\r\nTo: mattw@wasingerlawoffice.com <mattw@wasingerlawoffice.com>; LMTC@planethomelending.com <LMTC@planethomelending.com>\r\nCc: Marcus.Young@va.gov <Marcus.Young@va.gov>; Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>; VAVBAWAS/CO/Office of the USB VBA <OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov>; Tanielian, Terri L. EOP/WHO <Terri.L.Tanielian@who.eop.gov>\r\nSubject: Notice of Filed Board of Veterans' Appeals Appeal, Outstanding Information Requests, and Resulting Hardships\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wassinger,\r\nI am writing to formally notify you that on June 12, 2024, I filed an appeal with the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) regarding decisions made by the Department of Veterans Affairs concerning my VA-guaranteed home loan. This appeal addresses several critical issues, including:\r\n\r\n  1.  The VA's oversight of Planet Home Lending's compliance with VA regulations\r\n  2.  The application of COVID-19 forbearance protections\r\n  3.  The VA's duty to assist and apply the benefit of the doubt principle\r\n\r\nYou are specifically mentioned in this appeal regarding your testimony at the May 25, 2022 hearing in my divorce case, where you asserted an imminent risk of foreclosure on my property. I want to emphasize that this assertion, which my appeal demonstrates was inaccurate, has resulted in significant personal and financial hardships for me. These hardships include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n  *   A court order to sell my home based on the perceived imminent foreclosure risk\r\n  *   An immediate obligation to pay $27,000 to my ex-wife\r\n  *   Severe emotional distress and financial strain\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in July 2022, I submitted interrogatories and a request for records to Planet Home Lending which remain unanswered. This lack of response has further compounded my difficulties in resolving the issues with my loan.\r\nA copy of my complete BVA appeal is attached, detailing these issues and their impact.\r\nI also draw your attention to VA Circular 26-24-12 and its Change 1, issued on May 29, 2024, and June 21, 2024, which implement a targeted foreclosure moratorium through December 31, 2024.\r\nGiven my pending BVA appeal, the outstanding information requests, the new VA policies, and the severe hardships I've endured, I demand that you immediately cease any foreclosure actions related to my property. Please confirm receipt of this email and your understanding of the gravity of this situation.\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me directly.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, June 20, 2024 1:20 PM\r\nTo: Rep, Oversight (Veterans Affairs) <oversight@vetaff.senate.gov>\r\nSubject: Fw: VASP and Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024 and/or VA Home Loan Program Reform Act of 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSent: Friday, June 14, 2024 2:24 PM\r\nTo: derrick.vanorden@mail.house.gov <derrick.vanorden@mail.house.gov>\r\nCc: HVAC Info <hvacinfo@mail.house.gov>\r\nSubject: Fw: VASP and Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024 and/or VA Home Loan Program Reform Act of 2024\r\n\r\nDear Chairman Van Orden,\r\nI am writing to express my deep concern regarding both your line of questioning during the recent subcommittee hearing on June 12, 2024, concerning the Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024 and the content of the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act of 2024, which you recently introduced alongside Chairman Bost. While I commend the subcommittee's efforts to address the urgent foreclosure crisis facing veterans, I believe your approach to the VASP program was confusing, potentially misleading, and ultimately counterproductive. Moreover, I have serious reservations about the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act, specifically as it relates to veterans\u2019 due process rights, and your stance on VASP in light of existing statutory authority.\r\nRegarding your questioning about VASP during the hearing:\r\nYour repeated emphasis on the figure of 16 billion dollars as the potential cost of the VASP program, without providing clear context or supporting evidence, created an atmosphere of unwarranted alarm. While this figure is likely derived from estimations of potential taxpayer losses due to foreclosures, it's unclear if it represents a worst-case scenario or a realistic assessment of the program's risks. Conflating this number with the size of a typical mortgage company portfolio, as you did when questioning Ms. Karen Kretzschmar Paul, further muddled the issue. This conflation disregards the unique challenges and complexities associated with managing a program as large and multifaceted as VASP.\r\nFurthermore, your focus on a perceived contradiction between Mr. John Bell\u2019s earlier testimony and Secretary McDonough\u2019s statements regarding potential foreclosures under VASP, while understandable, lacked the necessary follow-through to gain clarity. While you rightly pressed Mr. Bell for a direct answer, his subsequent vague response and your immediate shift to another topic left the discrepancy unresolved and the subcommittee without a definitive understanding of the VA's position on this crucial matter.\r\nYour line of questioning seemed to center on an implied argument that the VASP program is poorly conceived, hastily implemented, and potentially disastrous for both veterans and taxpayers. This argument, while fueled by valid concerns about the VA's competence and transparency, was not effectively articulated or substantiated with concrete evidence during the hearing.\r\nEqually concerning are provisions within the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act that threaten to strip veterans of their due process rights. Declaring certain VA decisions \"final and not subject to judicial review\" removes a crucial avenue for veterans to challenge potentially unfair or inaccurate decisions. This lack of accountability could lead to situations where veterans are denied relief they rightfully deserve, with no opportunity for independent review.\r\nMy concern is further amplified by your apparent disregard for the existing authority granted to the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720. Subsections (3) and (4) of this statute explicitly empower the Secretary to \u201cpay, or compromise, any claim\u201d related to VA loan guarantees and to \u201crelease any right, title, claim, lien or demand, however acquired, including any equity,\u201d These provisions, through their ordinary meaning, grant the Secretary the authority to implement programs like VASP without the need for new legislation. Every Member of the majority has previously emphasized that the best way to respect congressional intent is to adhere to the ordinary understanding of the terms Congress uses. See, e.g., Jam v. International Finance Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 209 (2019); Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009); Wall v. Kholi, 562 U.S. 545, 551 (2011); BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S. 230, 237 (2021); Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651, 723, 727 (2023); Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U.S. 69, 77, 83 (2023).\r\nIf your intention is to fundamentally challenge the existing authority granted to the VA Secretary under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720, I implore you to explicitly state as much and provide a clear and reasoned justification for this departure from established legislative intent.\r\nTo address the concerns surrounding VASP and the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act, I urge you to prioritize:\r\n\r\n  *\r\nTransparency and Evidence: Provide clear and detailed explanations of the VASP program's design, implementation, and potential risks, supporting your assertions with concrete evidence and data.\r\n  *\r\nClarity and Consistency from the VA: Demand clear and consistent answers from VA officials regarding potential foreclosures under VASP and other loss mitigation programs.\r\n  *\r\nProtection of Due Process: Revise the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act to ensure veterans retain their full right to appeal VA decisions. This includes removing the limitations on judicial review and ensuring veterans have access to the same procedural safeguards afforded to them in other benefit cases.\r\n\r\nThe foreclosure crisis facing veterans demands a careful, data-driven approach and a commitment to upholding veterans' fundamental rights and honoring Congressional intent. By focusing on transparency, accountability, and due process, we can work together to develop effective and sustainable solutions that protect veterans and ensure the integrity of the VA Home Loan Program.\r\nMichael Locke\r\nFrom: NoReply@MyFax.com <NoReply@MyFax.com>\r\nSent: Wednesday, June 12, 2024 4:28 PM\r\nTo: mbl22885@msn.com <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSubject: Successful transmission to 18446788979<tel:18446788979>.

I believe these provisions constitute a clear violation of veterans' constitutional right to due process and will inevitably be challenged in the courts.\r\nRestricting veterans' rights to appeal VA decisions concerning home loans is a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. This clause, adopted in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, was intended to protect individuals from arbitrary actions by the federal government. It ensures that the government must follow legal procedures and respect all legal rights owed to a person according to the law. This includes fair notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. Denying veterans the ability to appeal VA decisions, especially those that could result in the loss of their homes, directly contradicts these fundamental principles.\r\nThe VA, like any government agency, is not infallible. Mistakes happen, and there is always a risk of bias or abuse of discretion. Veterans deserve a fair and impartial process for challenging VA decisions that could lead to the loss of their homes.\r\nThe proposed restrictions on appeal rights create a dangerous imbalance of power, stripping veterans of essential protections while granting the VA unchecked authority in these critically important matters. This will undoubtedly lead to protracted and costly litigation as veterans are forced to seek redress through the courts to defend their constitutional rights.\r\nI urge the Committee to reconsider these deeply flawed provisions and to prioritize the due process rights of those who have served our nation. Failure to do so will not only harm individual veterans facing foreclosure but will also erode the integrity of the VA Home Loan Guaranty program and undermine public trust in the agency's commitment to veterans' well-being.\r\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I implore you to uphold the Constitution and defend the rights of our nation's veterans.\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSent: Saturday, June 8, 2024 1:13 PM\r\nTo: Tanielian, Terri L.

I am writing to bring to your attention the broad authority granted to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a) and to request that the Secretary exercise this authority to implement a partial claim program and a foreclosure moratorium to provide much-needed relief to veteran homeowners facing hardship.\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a), the Secretary has the power to consent to the modification of the terms of any loan guaranteed, insured, or made under Title 38, including modifications to the rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest, security, or other provisions. This broad authority has been recently exercised through the issuance of VA Circular 26-24-8, which introduced a 40-year loan modification option for VA-guaranteed loans.\r\n\r\nCircular 26-24-8 specifically cites 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a)(2) as the statutory basis for the VA's authority to offer this expanded loan modification option. This provision empowers the Secretary to \"consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest or any portion thereof, security or other provisions of any note, contract, mortgage or other instrument securing a loan which has been guaranteed, insured, made or acquired under this chapter.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the VA has had the ability to offer a 40-year modification for almost three years, as evidenced by Ginnie Mae's announcement in June 2021, the VA only recently allowed for this option through the issuance of Circular 26-24-8 in April 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven the broad authority granted under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(a), I am respectfully requesting that the Secretary use this power to implement a partial claim program and a foreclosure moratorium to provide critical assistance to veteran homeowners impacted by the current economic crisis. These measures would prevent avoidable foreclosures, keep veterans in their homes, and mitigate losses to the VA loan program.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am copying VA leadership on this email, including VA Under Secretary for Benefits Joshua Jacobs and Deputy Director of Policy at the VA Loan Guaranty Service Michelle Corridon, as I intend for this request to be treated as a formal request for benefits subject to appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. If the VA Loan Guaranty Service is going to charge me their day rate, I believe it is only fair that I have the opportunity to fully assert my rights and hold them accountable in kind.\r\n\r\nI urge you and the copied VA leadership to take swift action under the Secretary's existing statutory authority to implement these crucial relief measures for veteran homeowners.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this critical issue. I appreciate your commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of our nation's veterans.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/LrHTR22pIhw?si=6BTiRfxcwtYsojx0\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSent: Friday, June 7, 2024 12:29 PM\r\nTo: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>\r\nSubject: Question Regarding VASP Eligibility and Loan Modifications\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Douglas,\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the Housing Policy Council's understanding of the eligibility criteria for the Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase (VASP) program, specifically as it relates to veterans who may qualify for other loan modifications.\r\n\r\nAccording to the VA Servicer Handbook M26-4, Chapter 9, Section 9.04(b), servicers are instructed to follow the VA Home Retention Waterfall to determine the most appropriate home retention option for veteran borrowers. The handbook states that if the waterfall review leads to VASP, the servicer should then review the qualifying loan criteria outlined in Section 9.04(b)(1-9).\r\n\r\nHowever, the handbook also notes that \"VASP is the final home retention option available in the VA Home Retention Waterfall.\" It further states that if the loan does not meet the VASP qualifying criteria, the servicer should evaluate and offer any appropriate alternatives to foreclosure.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of these guidelines is that if a veteran qualifies for another home retention option besides VASP during the waterfall review process, they would not be offered VASP. In other words, qualifying for a different loan modification would likely disqualify a veteran from receiving assistance through VASP.\r\n\r\nI am particularly concerned about this issue in light of the recent NPR article titled \"The VA tells banks not to foreclose on veterans' homes this year,\" published on June 7, 2024, by Chris Arnold and Quil Lawrence. The article features the stories of two veterans, Edward O'Conner and Josiah Mena, who seem to be under the impression that they might qualify for VASP despite apparently qualifying for other loan modifications. This apparent discrepancy between the veterans' understanding and the guidelines outlined in the VA Servicer Handbook is troubling and may lead to confusion and false hopes among veteran borrowers.\r\n\r\nCan you please confirm if the Housing Policy Council's interpretation of the VASP eligibility requirements aligns with the understanding that qualifying for a loan modification other than VASP would disqualify a veteran from participating in the VASP program? Additionally, I would appreciate any insight you can provide on how the VA and mortgage servicers can work together to ensure that veteran borrowers receive clear, accurate, and consistent information about their eligibility for various home retention options, including VASP.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any additional information you can provide to help clarify this important issue for our nation's veterans.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMichael Locke\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Tanielian, Terri L.

The current crisis facing veterans struggling to keep their homes demands immediate attention and a bold response from the White House.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the VA's decision to end the Partial Claim Payment (PCP) program, coupled with rising interest rates and a lack of adequate loss mitigation options, has created a perfect storm for veteran foreclosures. Thousands of veterans, through no fault of their own, are now at risk of losing their homes, despite having faithfully served our nation.\r\n\r\nI understand you are incredibly busy, but I believe this situation is reaching a critical point, demanding immediate intervention. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bost has publicly stated he is eager to \"fix the VA's mess through legislation in the coming weeks,\" indicating that the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" is moving forward rapidly. Unfortunately, it appears that the bill is being driven more by the interests of the mortgage industry than the needs and rights of veterans.\r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\n  *   Industry's Preferred Solution: The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) has stated their preference is for a permanent partial claim program.\r\n\r\n  *   VASP Implementation Concerns: While the MBA and Housing Policy Council (HPC) publicly express concerns about the VASP program's implementation, I believe their actions are a calculated tactic to delay and ultimately weaken the program. The supposed lack of details and preparedness conveniently serves their interests by pushing back the implementation of a program they don't truly support.\r\n\r\n  *   Congressional Priorities: Chairman Bost's statement highlights the political motivations behind the Act, seemingly focusing on \"election year politics\" despite claiming the contrary and protecting the VA from \"a financial burden of billions of dollars in bailouts for lenders.\" There is no mention of ensuring veteran protections or holding the VA accountable for its past failures.\r\n\r\nBased on these observations, I believe the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act\" is a deeply flawed piece of legislation that will do more harm than good. It prioritizes the interests of the lending industry over the rights of veterans and will likely result in:\r\n\r\n  *   Weakened Loss Mitigation Programs: The VASP program, even if implemented, will be watered down and less effective than it could be due to industry influence and political maneuvering.\r\n\r\n  *   Erosion of Due Process Rights: The provision stripping judicial review and redefining \"provision of benefits\" will leave veterans with fewer options for challenging the VA's actions and holding them accountable for misconduct or negligence.\r\n\r\nThis push for the Act is a direct response to increased scrutiny of the VA's handling of the Home Loan Guaranty program. As a VA Loan Guaranty employee told me in 2023:\r\n\r\n\"Nearly every policy in place at the home loan guaranty office is about risk mitigation for the loan, not keeping people in homes. From the 'waterfall' process to the newly proposed ability for the VA to take on non-performing loans as a servicer, most of the positions come from the mindset 'happy lenders will be more likely to offer VA loans.' There's a reason there is a yearly VA lenders conference but almost no outreach to Veterans.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes it clear that the VA prioritizes lenders over veteran borrowers, and the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act\" is an attempt to further cement this imbalance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tanielian, I urge you to advocate for President Biden to issue an Executive Order directing the VA to take the following actions, all possible under existing legal authorities:\r\n\r\n  1.  Institute an Actual Immediate Moratorium on VA Home Loan Foreclosures : This will provide immediate relief and buy time for more effective solutions. The VA has the authority to enact a moratorium under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720.\r\n\r\n  1.  Reinstate the Partial Claim Payment Program: This program provided a lifeline for veterans, and the VA has the authority to reinstate it using existing funds and resources.\r\n\r\n  1.  Direct the VA to Proactively and Meaingfully Engage with Veteran Borrowers: The VA must reach out to veterans facing hardship and provide clear information about available options.

I previously anticipated that this bill would move forward in its current form, and unfortunately, it seems my prediction was accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAllow me to make another prediction: Any bill that arguably weakens veterans' benefits is a significant misstep, especially in light of the recruiting challenges currently faced by all service branches. It is well-documented that military families make up a substantial portion of the volunteer force, with 40% of new recruits having a close family member who has served. This tradition of service is vital to maintaining the strength and readiness of our military.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakening veterans' benefits not only undermines the sacrifices made by our service members but also dissuades potential recruits from considering a military career. In a time when the Department of Defense is struggling to meet recruitment quotas , it is crucial to support and honor those who serve, ensuring they and their families receive the benefits they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and ensure that it strengthens, rather than weakens, the support provided to our veterans. Our nation's security and the future of our volunteer military depend on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Bass Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Sunday, June 2, 2024 11:45 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov> <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>; VAVBAWAS/CO/Office of the USB VBA <OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov<mailto:OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Fw: New Claim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue 3: The VA Should Broadly Interpret \"Obligation\" Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732 and Cover the $27,000 Payment Owed to My Ex-Wife as a Direct Consequence of Its Oversight Failures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's failure to properly oversee Planet Home Lending's compliance with VA regulations, coupled with the servicer's potentially biased actions, directly led to the court-ordered sale of my home. Specifically, the June 13, 2022, court order in my divorce case (Exhibit 15, p. 5, para. G) states that, due to the pending foreclosure, \"...the closing proceeds shall be held in escrow until the Court can make a determination as to the correct amount\" of the equalizing payment owed to my ex-wife. This sale triggers an immediate payment obligation of approximately $27,000 to my ex-wife, representing the remaining balance on this equalizing payment, which was secured by the property as part of our divorce settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, the court order to sell my home was based on the assertion that the property was at imminent risk of foreclosure. This assertion, presented through the testimony of Planet Home Lending's attorney, Mr. Wasinger, at the May 25, 2022 hearing (Exhibit [Exhibit Number for Hearing Minutes]), appears to have been inaccurate. VALERI records, as well as my own recollection of when I requested forbearances (and servicer Planet Home Lending's refusal to provide applicable collections records, as well as the refusal of VA employees with direct oversight to intervene and compel Planet Home Lending to provide said collection records), strongly suggests that PHL misrepresented the actual forbearance timeline. The VA failed to apply the benefit of the doubt principle (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b)) in my favor when evaluating this information, despite the clear evidence supporting my position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Planet Home Lending, I was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan in May 2020, which was extended multiple times from August 2020 through August 31, 2021 (Exhibit [Exhibit Number for PHL CFPB Response]). However, the VALERI records do not show any special forbearance reported for May 2020 (Exhibit [Exhibit Number for VALERI Records]). Furthermore, I do not recall requesting a forbearance except for May 2020, August 2020, and October of 2021. Despite my requests and the intervention of the VA, Planet Home Lending has refused to provide the applicable collection records that would clarify this discrepancy. Worse yet, the VA being fully aware of this refusal has refused to assist in obtaining these records that would clarify this discrepancy .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA Circular 26-20-12(3) states that \"The borrower, not the servicer, is entitled to determine the period of forbearance...\" (Exhibit [Exhibit Number for VA Circular 26-20-12]). However, Planet Home Lending appears to have unilaterally determined the forbearance periods without my input. This, combined with the VA's lack of engagement and their failure to present evidence contradicting the servicer's claims, demonstrates a disregard for their duty to protect my interests and ensure a fair and accurate assessment of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the VA failed to properly monitor and inform me of my remaining COVID-19 forbearance eligibility, which directly contributed to the court order to sell my home. Despite having 18 months of potential COVID-19-related forbearance available, the VALERI records as of June 2022 (Exhibit [Exhibit Number for VALERI Records]) indicate that I had only utilized 11 months. The VA did not inform me of this remaining eligibility, nor did they intervene to ensure Planet Home Lending considered this option as a means to avoid foreclosure. Had the VA fulfilled its duty to assist and properly tracked my forbearance usage, I could have potentially utilized those remaining 7 months of forbearance to stabilize my financial situation and avoid the court order to sell my home. Their failure to do so represents a direct violation of their obligation to assist me in obtaining the full benefits and protections available under the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a well-established link between homelessness and increased suicide risk that the VA is fully aware of. Veterans who have experienced homelessness are almost twice as likely as non-Veterans who have experienced homelessness, and 11 times as likely as other Veterans, to report lifetime suicide attempts. Even after controlling for other risk factors, Veterans who have experienced homelessness in their lifetime are nearly four times as likely as other Veterans to have ever attempted suicide. Housing instability is also associated with suicide. In one study, Veterans with past-year housing instability were six times as likely as those who did not experience housing instability to report suicidal ideation. Reducing the likelihood that an individual will experience a suicidal crisis requires addressing factors such as increased financial strain and lack of housing that may contribute to or increase risk for suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA has repeatedly stated that preventing Veteran suicide is one of its top priorities. Given this, it follows that the VA should be taking all appropriate actions to prevent unnecessary foreclosures and resulting homelessness among Veterans, knowing the strong association with suicide risk. My situation is a prime example of where the VA failed to intervene and exercise proper oversight despite being notified of the loan servicer's potential violations of VA regulations designed to protect Veterans from foreclosure. This directly led to the court-ordered sale of my home and the triggering of the $27,000 payment to my ex-wife, putting me at greater risk of housing instability and the associated suicide risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's inaction has not only resulted in the potential loss of my home but has also created a significant financial burden in the form of the $27,000 payment, exacerbating my stress and anxiety. This financial strain, directly caused by the VA's failures, is a known risk factor for suicide among veterans, further highlighting the VA's moral and ethical obligation to mitigate the harm they have caused and provide financial relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the court has ordered the sale of the property, my ex-wife has expressed her willingness to allow me to pursue other options to keep my home, contingent upon receiving the $27,000 payment. In a message dated May 30, 2024 (Exhibit [Exhibit Number for OFW Message]), she states: \"If I am paid the remaining obligation owed to me in the amount of $27,000, I will sign a quit claim deed giving you exclusive ownership of the property at 127 Delvalle St. Melbourne Beach, FL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI contend that the VA should assume responsibility for this $27,000 payment based on the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect Consequence of VA Failures: This debt, while stemming from my divorce settlement, is inextricably tied to the property and functions as a secured interest. The court-ordered sale, a direct result of the VA's failure to properly oversee the pending foreclosure proceedings, makes this payment immediately due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's failure to properly monitor my forbearance usage and inform me of my remaining eligibility directly resulted in the court's perception of an imminent foreclosure risk. This inaccurate assessment, fueled by the VA's inaction, was the primary basis for the court order to sell my home, which, in turn, triggered the immediate need for the $27,000 payment to my ex-wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's failure to investigate the discrepancies in the forbearance dates reported by Planet Home Lending and to obtain the servicer's collection records, despite my repeated requests, prevented me from demonstrating that the foreclosure risk was not imminent and that alternative solutions were available. This failure to act directly contributed to the court's decision to order the sale of my home and the resulting financial obligation to my ex-wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's failure to fulfill its statutory duty to assist me under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A (Exhibit 3) is a direct cause of this situation. The VA received clear notice of Planet Home Lending's potential violations of VA Circular 26-20-12 (Exhibit 4) through my repeated requests for assistance, documented in emails from August 20, 2023, to March 19, 2024 (Exhibit 1, pp. 4, 5, 10, 53, 57, 65). Despite this, the VA failed to take concrete action to investigate these concerns, obtain relevant documentation from Planet Home Lending, or ensure the servicer was adhering to the circular's mandates. These failures directly led to the imminent risk of foreclosure and the subsequent court order to sell the property, which triggered the immediate need for the $27,000 payment to my ex-wife. Furthermore, the VA's failure to apply the benefit of the doubt principle, as mandated by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b), directly contributed to the need for this payment. Had they resolved ambiguities in my favor and taken a more proactive approach to assisting me, including properly monitoring my forbearance usage and challenging PHL's claims about imminent foreclosure risk, the court order to sell my home could have been avoided, and this financial obligation would not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBroad Interpretation of \"Obligation\" under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732: The VA has the authority under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(a)(2)(A) to cover \"the unpaid balance of the obligation plus accrued interest\" upon loan default. I argue that this \"obligation\" should be interpreted broadly to encompass financial obligations directly stemming from the VA's failure to properly oversee the loan, including the payment owed to my ex-wife. This aligns with the statute's intent to protect veterans from financial losses caused by the mishandling of their VA-guaranteed loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, this provision could cover legal fees incurred due to my need to defend against the foreclosure action, which was a direct result of the VA's failure to enforce Circular 26-20-12 and hold Planet Home Lending accountable. It could also encompass additional mortgage payments that accrued due to the VA's delay in processing my loss mitigation application and their failure to ensure that Planet Home Lending offered me all eligible options, including the VA Disaster Loan Modification. Furthermore, moving expenses and other costs associated with finding new housing, should I be unable to retain my current home due to the VA's failures, should also be considered under this broad interpretation of \"obligation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquitable Relief is Warranted: The VA has a moral and ethical obligation to provide equitable relief when its failures contribute to a veteran's financial hardship. By covering this $27,000 payment, the VA can mitigate the harm caused by their inadequate oversight and prevent further financial burden on me, a veteran facing the loss of his home due to failures within the VA Home Loan program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis payment should be considered a direct consequence of the VA's failure to uphold its responsibilities under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732. Covering this cost would not only rectify the financial harm caused by the VA's actions but also demonstrate a commitment to fulfilling their duty to protect veterans from undue hardship stemming from their programs. The VA's responsibility goes beyond a mere technical obligation regarding the loan guarantee - it failed to uphold its fundamental mission and duty to protect the well-being of a veteran under its purview. This should compel the VA to interpret its obligations broadly and provide the equitable relief I am seeking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's failure to uphold its responsibilities has placed an undue financial and emotional burden on me, jeopardizing my housing stability and well-being. Given the clear connection between the VA's actions and the necessity of this $27,000 payment, I urge the Board to order the VA to cover this cost, demonstrating a commitment to protecting veterans from the harmful consequences of their own administrative failures.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Friday, May 31, 2024 3:27 PM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov> <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: VAVBAWAS/CO/Office of the USB VBA <OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov<mailto:OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: New Claim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnically I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever made this claim, so do you guys mind providing a decision by the end of the day?

The VA actually had something in place to help borrowers and reduce government loss before the partial claim program via VA Circular 26-20-12. Do you guys mind mentioning it in any future coverage? It was in effect from 4/8/2020-7/1/2021, so roughly the same amount of time as the partial claim program. Most of the vets that should of been assisted by VA Circular 26-20-12 have probably long since been foreclosed on, but who knows, and maybe someone so inclined brings suit against applicable servicers under the False Claims Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA Circular 26-20-12 basically said \u201cServicers must ensure that borrowers are given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. If no loss mitigation options are possible, and in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d In that sense, it was kind of like the current VA loss mitigation waterfall that includes VASP, but with the force of law due to the use of \u201cmust.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the time of this email exchange, I was receiving inpatient treatment for PTSD through the VA Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Program:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[image/jpeg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At the time (1/14/2021), no loss mitigation options were possible, but my home loan was never referred to the VA for possible refunding. Unfortunately for me, the VA employee charged with overseeing the servicing of my home loan was apparently unaware of the refunding referral requirement, despite providing me with VA Circular 26-20-12 five months earlier:\r\n\r\n[image/jpeg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, May 28, 2024 1:58 PM\r\nTo: Pmurray@vfw.org<mailto:Pmurray@vfw.org> <Pmurray@vfw.org<mailto:Pmurray@vfw.org>>\r\nCc: Katz, John, VSOPHIL <John.Katz@va.gov<mailto:John.Katz@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Urgent Follow Up: VFW's Position on Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024 - Request for Reconsideration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Murray,\r\n\r\nI am writing to follow up on my previous email dated May 10, 2024, expressing my concerns about the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" (S. 3728) and respectfully requesting that the VFW reconsider its support for the bill in its current form. I am forwarding the original email chain for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs I attempted to contact you by phone today, I was advised by your receptionist to reiterate my concerns via email. I understand you are incredibly busy, but I believe this issue is of paramount importance to veterans facing foreclosure and warrants your urgent attention.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in my previous email, I am deeply troubled by Section 3723(f)(3) of the Act, which could be interpreted as stripping veterans of crucial legal protections, including:\r\n\r\n  1.  The VA's Duty to Assist (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A): This vital protection ensures the VA actively aids veterans in gathering evidence and presenting their claims for benefits. Removing this duty in the context of home loans would leave veterans vulnerable and navigating complex legal proceedings alone.\r\n\r\n  1.  The Benefit of the Doubt principle (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b)): This bedrock of veterans' law mandates that the VA give veterans the benefit of the doubt when evidence is balanced or unclear. Eliminating this protection could unfairly disadvantage veterans in disputes with the VA or loan servicers.\r\n\r\n  1.  The Right to Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals: This provision could bar veterans from appealing decisions related to the new Partial Claim Program, denying them an avenue for independent review and redress for potentially unjust or erroneous decisions.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience with the VA Home Loan Guaranty program, outlined in the attached email chain, demonstrates the devastating consequences of a lack of oversight, inconsistent application of regulations, and disregard for veterans' due process rights. This situation is not unique to me, as evidenced by the alarming rate of veteran foreclosures and the VA's ongoing struggles to address this crisis effectively.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe the VA already possesses the authority to implement a foreclosure moratorium and a partial claim program without new legislation. The agency could utilize existing authorities under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720 to provide immediate relief to veteran borrowers facing hardship.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I urge the VFW to reconsider its support for the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" in its current form. Instead, I believe the VFW should advocate for:\r\n\r\n  *   Amendments to the Act: Remove the limitations on judicial review and appeal rights, ensuring veterans retain their full legal protections and access to due process.\r\n\r\n  *   VA Action Utilizing Existing Authority: Urge the VA to implement a foreclosure moratorium and a partial claim program using its existing authorities under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720 to provide immediate relief to struggling veterans.\r\n\r\nThis approach would better protect veterans and ensure their access to justice while addressing the urgent foreclosure crisis.\r\n\r\nI hope the VFW will prioritize the rights and well-being of our nation's heroes and take a strong stance against any legislation that could erode their hard-earned protections.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Sunday, May 26, 2024 12:22 PM\r\n\r\nTo: VAVBAWAS/CO/Office of the USB VBA <OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov<mailto:OfficeoftheUnderSecretaryforBenefits@va.gov>>; joshua.jacobs@va.gov<mailto:joshua.jacobs@va.gov> <joshua.jacobs@va.gov<mailto:joshua.jacobs@va.gov>>\r\n\r\nCc: SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov> <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\n\r\nSubject: VA Home Loan Loss Mitigation Requests - Question Regarding Claimant Status and VA Duties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to inquire whether VBA Loan Guaranty employees are aware of the status of individuals requesting loss mitigation assistance for their VA home loans and the corresponding duties of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in processing these requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), specifically 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5100, a \"claimant\" is defined as \"any individual applying for, or submitting a claim for, any benefit under the laws administered by the Secretary.\" As VA home loan benefits, including loss mitigation options, are benefits administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the laws governing the VA, an individual requesting to qualify for such benefits is considered a \"claimant\" for the purposes of the VCAA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the plain text of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a) establishes that decisions concerning VA home loans are decisions under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans. This statute states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or the dependents or survivors of veterans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA home loan benefits, including loss mitigation options, are clearly benefits provided to veterans under laws administered by the Secretary. Therefore, any decision made by the Secretary or their designees concerning these benefits, such as whether to grant loss mitigation assistance, is a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits to veterans. The broad language of \u00a7 511(a) encompasses all such decisions, as it refers to \"all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary\" under these benefits laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the inclusion of subsection (b)(3) in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511, which specifically lists \"matters arising under chapter 37 of this title\" as an exception to the general rule of finality of the Secretary's decisions, strongly supports the interpretation that VA home loan decisions, including those related to loss mitigation, are decisions under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans. Chapter 37 of Title 38, U.S. Code, covers housing and small business loans for veterans, including VA home loan benefits. By explicitly carving out an exception for matters arising under this chapter, Congress has acknowledged that decisions made pursuant to this chapter are, in fact, decisions under a law that affects the provision of benefits to veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently, when a veteran or other eligible individual requests loss mitigation assistance for their VA home loan, the VA has specific duties under the VCAA to assist the claimant in developing their claim. These duties, as outlined in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5102 and 5103, include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Furnishing all necessary forms and instructions upon request (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5102(a));\r\n\r\n2. Notifying the claimant of any incomplete application and the information needed to complete it (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5102(b)); and\r\n\r\n3. Upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application, notifying the claimant of any information or evidence needed to substantiate the claim and indicating which portion is to be provided by the claimant and which portion the VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is crucial to note that in the VA benefits system, the standard of proof is a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which is a lower and more easily met standard compared to other legal contexts. If the evidence supporting a claim is ever so slightly more than the evidence against it, the claim should be granted. This principle is further reinforced by the \"benefit of the doubt\" rule, codified in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b), which states that when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of these statutory requirements and the unique evidentiary standards in VA benefits cases, are VBA Loan Guaranty employees aware that applicants for VA home loan loss mitigation are considered claimants, and are they taking the necessary steps to fulfill the VA's duties to assist them in developing their claims? Failure to apply the benefit of the doubt rule or to set forth clear reasons for not applying it may constitute error (see O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, 367 (1991); Sussex v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 526, 529 (1991)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any information you can provide on the training and practices of VBA Loan Guaranty employees in this regard. It is essential that they understand their obligations under the law when processing these requests to ensure that veterans and other eligible individuals receive the full benefits and protections to which they are entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, May 22, 2024 4:14 PM\r\n\r\nTo: HVAC Info <hvacinfo@mail.house.gov<mailto:hvacinfo@mail.house.gov>>; oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov> <oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov>>\r\n\r\nSubject: \"Outstanding or Unsatisfactory?: Examining Whether the Biden Administration is Holding VA's Leaders Accountable\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Audo,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to urgently request the attention of the HVAC Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations regarding the VA's inadequate response to my FOIA request (No. 23-12977-F). This matter is directly relevant to the postponed oversight hearing, \"Outstanding or Unsatisfactory?: Examining Whether the Biden Administration is Holding VA's Leaders Accountable,\" as it raises serious questions about the VA's accountability and potential negligence in addressing systemic problems within the Home Loan Guaranty Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs detailed in my previous communications, I have raised significant concerns about the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" and broader issues within the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program. My FOIA request seeks critical information directly related to these concerns, specifically email correspondence regarding the VA's internal assessment of risks to borrowers in its disaster loan modification program. This program serves as a revealing case study for potentially widespread issues affecting countless veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA has denied my FOIA request citing Exemption 5 (deliberative process privilege), but their justification lacks the specificity and concreteness required under current legal standards. As emphasized in recent court decisions like Machado Amadis v. U.S. Department of State and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press v. FBI, agencies must provide detailed and focused reasons demonstrating how the release of particular information would cause foreseeable harm. The VA's generalized assertion that disclosure could negatively impact frank discussions fails to meet this exacting standard. Moreover, the compelling public interest in transparency surrounding this program, especially given the potential impact on vulnerable veterans, far outweighs the VA's tenuous arguments for withholding this information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VA's denial of my FOIA request raises grave concerns not just about the disaster loan modification program, but also about the VA's broader handling of potential risks within the Home Loan Guaranty Program. The 2019 VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) report (VAOIG-18-03979-204), which revealed an alarming 45% error rate in a sample of disaster-area loan modifications and evidence of a servicer pushing borrowers into unfavorable terms, exemplifies this concern. Despite these red flags, the VA's Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) conducted only a superficial \"preliminary assessment\" and claimed no further action was needed, without disclosing their methodology or findings. The OIG's deference to this limited response, without securing concrete corrective action commitments, is deeply troubling and deviates from the rigorous approach it took to other issues in the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis instance raises serious concerns that the VA may be employing similarly insufficient responses to other systemic problems within the Home Loan Guaranty Program, leaving veterans vulnerable to potential harm and highlighting a critical need for greater transparency and accountability. Furthermore, the VA's delay in providing the requested records under FOIA is prejudicing veterans' ability to meaningfully appeal VA decisions and seek timely relief, as exemplified by my own pending case before the Board of Veterans' Appeals regarding the VA's non-enforcement of pandemic-related protections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo provide further context, I have attached a copy of my correspondence and appeal with the VA FOIA General Counsel regarding this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, I respectfully request the HVAC Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Demand the VA immediately release the requested information in full or provide a detailed, particularized, and compelling justification for withholding any portion of it that satisfies the strict foreseeable harm standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Include the VA's mishandling of the disaster loan modification program, its inadequate response to the 2019 OIG report, and its unjustified denial of my FOIA request as specific points of inquiry for the rescheduled oversight hearing on VA leadership accountability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Investigate the potential existence of similar patterns of insufficient responses and lack of transparency from the VA regarding other systemic issues within the Home Loan Guaranty Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObtaining this information is crucial for the Subcommittee to fulfill its essential oversight responsibilities and make informed decisions about the VA's performance and accountability. By taking decisive action, the Subcommittee can demonstrate its commitment to transparency, restore a measure of justice for veterans who have been harmed, and ensure that the VA is truly serving the best interests of those who have served our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your prompt response and the Subcommittee's robust action on this urgent matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\nFrom: Quil Lawrence <DLawrence@npr.org<mailto:DLawrence@npr.org>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, May 15, 2024 4:34 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Chris Arnold <CArnold@npr.org<mailto:CArnold@npr.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: VA Home Loan Crisis Deepens: Flaws in VASP Rollout and Legislation Eroding Veterans' Rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for looping us in Michael -  we\u2019ve got many of the same questions,  and we\u2019ll probably be back at this story again soon.

Recent developments, including concerns raised by industry experts about\r\n\r\nZjQcmQRYFpfptBannerStart\r\n\r\nExternal Email - Use Caution\r\n\r\nZjQcmQRYFpfptBannerEnd\r\n\r\nDear Chris and Quil,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out with critical updates on the VA home loan crisis that demand further investigation and reporting. Recent developments, including concerns raised by industry experts about the implementation of the VA's new VASP program and the introduction of legislation that could severely erode veterans' appeal rights, have heightened the urgency of this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a joint letter dated May 3, 2024, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) and Housing Policy Council (HPC) expressed serious concerns about the lack of guidance and preparedness surrounding the VASP program's rollout. The letter highlights the need for clear communication with veterans and a realistic timeline for implementation, given the complex loss mitigation and servicing transfer processes involved. This echoes the issues raised by Matt Douglas from the HPC, who shared with me that despite the VA publishing some guidance on VASP, there are still significant gaps and unanswered questions that could hinder the program's effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MBA and HPC's call for an extension of the mandatory compliance date and the voluntary foreclosure moratorium underscores the depth of the challenges facing the VASP program. It's becoming increasingly clear that the VA's public messaging about the program's availability may be creating false expectations among veterans desperately in need of relief. The lack of comprehensive guidance and the VA's failure to provide timely, detailed responses to servicers' concerns raise serious doubts about the agency's readiness to implement VASP effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a veteran who has been fighting for years to hold the VA accountable and access the protections I'm entitled to under existing relief programs, I know firsthand how devastating these bureaucratic failings can be. My own correspondence with VA officials, which you can view in the attached document \"va correspondence including breakdown of evasive answers.pdf,\" reveals a pattern of evasion, contradictions, and a disturbing lack of transparency. This extensive document exists solely because I have asserted my rights under the current protections in the U.S. Code \u2013 the very same rights that Section 3723(f)(3) of the proposed \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" would eliminate. Even with my ability to invoke these protections, the VA's inability or unwillingness to provide clear answers about its actions and the options available to veterans has left my situation unresolved and countless other individuals in a state of constant uncertainty and hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo further explain the problems created by the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024,\" it's crucial to note that Section 3723(f)(3) could effectively strip away veterans' right to appeal any decisions made by the VA in response to a home loan default, not just those related to the new Partial Claim Program. By stating that such decisions \"shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits,\" this deeply concerning provision threatens to eliminate crucial legal protections and due process rights for veterans seeking relief, leaving them virtually defenseless against bureaucratic errors, delays, and abuses across the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is particularly troubling given the insights provided by Steve Sharpe, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, in your original article from November 11, 2023. Sharpe emphasized the need for a pause on foreclosures and the importance of ensuring veterans have access to a program that truly works. He also pointed out that the VA already has the authority to both restart the PCP program and implement a foreclosure moratorium. In light of this, it appears that the primary purpose of the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" is to erode veterans' ability to challenge VA decisions related to home loans, rather than providing meaningful relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this evolving crisis demands further investigation and reporting. The public needs to know about the serious flaws in the VASP program's implementation, the VA's ongoing failure to provide transparency and accountability, and the looming threat to veterans' rights posed by the new legislation. Policymakers must be held accountable for any attempts to erode veterans' hard-won protections, and the human cost of the VA's failures should be brought to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your ongoing commitment to covering these critical issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, May 14, 2024 12:56 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Clarification on VASP Program Guidance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo problem.

My name is Michael Locke, and I am a veteran homeowner who has been closely following the development of the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024.\" While I appreciate the Housing Policy Council's (HPC) efforts to advocate for expanded loss mitigation options for veteran borrowers, I am deeply concerned about the potential impact of certain provisions in the Act on veterans' due process rights.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Section 3723(f)(3) of the Act, which states that decisions made under the new Partial Claim Program \"shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits,\" raises serious concerns about veterans' ability to challenge adverse decisions and hold the VA accountable for its actions. This language could be interpreted as significantly limiting, or even eliminating, veterans' access to judicial review and appeal rights, potentially undermining crucial protections such as the duty to assist, benefit of the doubt, and the right to appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.\r\n\r\nAs a veteran who has personally experienced challenges with the VA Home Loan Guaranty program and its oversight of loan servicers, I am particularly troubled by the potential erosion of these fundamental rights. My own case, which involves the VA's failure to enforce the protections afforded to me under VA Circular 26-20-12, highlights the importance of ensuring that veterans have access to due process and a fair opportunity to seek redress for unfair or unlawful treatment.\r\n\r\nGiven the HPC's active involvement in advocating for changes to the VA Home Loan Guaranty program, I am writing to inquire about the HPC's role in the inclusion of Section 3723(f)(3) in the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024.\" Specifically, I would appreciate any insights you could provide on the following:\r\n\r\n  *   Was the HPC involved in discussions or negotiations regarding the inclusion of this provision in the bill?\r\n\r\n  *   If so, what was the HPC's position on the potential impact of this provision on veterans' due process rights?\r\n\r\n  *   Does the HPC believe that the current language in Section 3723(f)(3) adequately balances the need for expanded loss mitigation options with the importance of protecting veterans' fundamental rights?\r\n\r\nI believe that it is crucial to ensure that any expansion of loss mitigation options does not come at the expense of veterans' access to justice and fair treatment. I urge the HPC to carefully consider the potential consequences of this provision and to advocate for amendments that would clarify the limitations on judicial review and preserve veterans' full appeal rights and access to legal protections.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Friday, May 10, 2024 10:43 AM\r\nTo: Pmurray@vfw.org<mailto:Pmurray@vfw.org> <Pmurray@vfw.org<mailto:Pmurray@vfw.org>>\r\nSubject: Fw: Inquiry Regarding Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024 - Section 3723(f)(3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Murray,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Michael Locke, and I am a veteran from Florida who has been deeply impacted by the VA's failure to adequately address the foreclosure crisis facing veterans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am writing to you today to express my concerns about the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" (S. 3728) and to respectfully request that the VFW reconsider its support for the bill in its current form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the Act's intent to reestablish a partial claim program for veterans facing foreclosure, I believe that certain provisions within the bill could have unintended consequences that ultimately harm veterans and undermine their access to due process. Specifically, Section 3723(f)(3) of the Act, which states that decisions made under the new Partial Claim Program \"shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits,\" is deeply concerning. This language could be interpreted as significantly limiting, or even eliminating, crucial veteran protections such as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The VA's duty to assist veterans in developing their claims for benefits (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A).\r\n\r\n2. The benefit of the doubt principle, which requires the VA to give veterans the benefit of the doubt when evidence is balanced or unclear (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b)).\r\n\r\n3. The right to appeal adverse decisions to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a veteran who has personally struggled to navigate the VA Home Loan Guaranty program and assert my rights when faced with improper denials of assistance, I am deeply troubled by any provision that would restrict veterans' access to due process and judicial review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe that the VA already possesses the authority to implement a foreclosure moratorium and a partial claim program without the need for new legislation. As evidenced by the VA's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency has the ability to utilize existing authorities under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720 to provide relief to veteran borrowers facing hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, I urge the VFW to take a deeper look at the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" and consider the potential negative consequences of its provisions on veterans' rights. I believe that advocating for amendments to remove the limitations on judicial review and appeal rights, while simultaneously urging the VA to utilize its existing authorities to address the foreclosure crisis, would be a more effective approach to protecting veterans and ensuring their access to justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a fellow veteran, I am grateful for the VFW's commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of our nation's heroes. I am available to provide further information and documentation to support my claims and to discuss these issues in more detail at your convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\nMelbourne Beach, FL\r\n\r\n(321) 506-9557<tel:(321)%20506-9557>\r\n\r\nmbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Hahn, Kate (Tester) <Kate_Hahn@tester.senate.gov<mailto:Kate_Hahn@tester.senate.gov>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, May 7, 2024 5:09 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: RE: Inquiry Regarding Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024 - Section 3723(f)(3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Afternoon Mr. Locke,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to Senator Jon Tester with your questions and concerns about Section 3723(f)(3) of the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" (S. 3728).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have forwarded your email to my colleague with the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who deals with Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024.

I am writing to you today to express my concerns regarding Section 3723(f)(3) of the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" (S. 3728), introduced by Senator Jon Tester.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the intent of the bill to provide expanded loss mitigation options for veteran homeowners, I am deeply concerned about the potential impact of Section 3723(f)(3) on veterans' rights to appeal VA home loan decisions. The language in this section, which states that decisions made under the new Partial Claim Program \"shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits,\" could be interpreted as significantly limiting veterans' access to due process and judicial review.\r\n\r\nAs a veteran who has personally experienced challenges with the VA Home Loan Guaranty program and its oversight of loan servicers, I am particularly troubled by this provision. My own case, which involves the VA's failure to enforce the protections afforded to me under VA Circular 26-20-12, highlights the importance of ensuring that veterans have the right to appeal adverse decisions and hold the VA accountable for its actions.\r\n\r\nI am reaching out to you today to request your assistance in obtaining information about the inclusion and wording of Section 3723(f)(3) in the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024.\" Specifically, I would appreciate any insights you could provide on the following:\r\n\r\n  *   The rationale behind the inclusion of this provision in the bill.\r\n\r\n  *   Whether the potential impact on veterans' appeal rights was considered during the drafting process.\r\n\r\n  *   Whether Senator Tester's office is open to considering amendments to clarify the limitations on judicial review and ensure that veterans retain their full appeal rights for all home loan decisions.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is crucial to ensure that any expansion of loss mitigation options does not come at the expense of veterans' fundamental rights to due process and fair treatment. I am hopeful that Senator Tester's office will be receptive to addressing these concerns and working towards a solution that protects the rights and interests of all veteran borrowers.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, May 1, 2024 1:12 PM\r\nTo: oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov> <oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov>>; hvacinfo@mail.house.gov<mailto:hvacinfo@mail.house.gov> <hvacinfo@mail.house.gov<mailto:hvacinfo@mail.house.gov>>\r\nSubject: Request for VA Communications Regarding the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Austin,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring to your attention that I recently reached out to Michelle Corridon, the Deputy Director of Policy at the VA's Loan Guaranty Service, regarding my concerns about Sections 3723(f)(3) and 3732(f)(3) of the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024.\" Unfortunately, I have not received a response to my inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my correspondence with Mrs. Corridon, I asked whether the VA had provided any technical assistance or expressed views on these provisions during the drafting process, and if so, whether the potential unintended consequences of diminishing veterans' procedural protections and appeal rights were considered. I also suggested clarifying the language to ensure that the judicial review limitations only apply to the new programs created by the Act, while preserving veterans' full appeal rights for other home loan decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the lack of response from the VA, it seems that my only viable option to obtain information about the VA's role in shaping these provisions is through the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. To assist the subcommittee in their evaluation of the potential impact of Sections 3723(f)(3) and 3732(f)(3) on veterans' rights and access to benefits, I respectfully request any available communications between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs regarding the development and drafting of these specific provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn particular, I am seeking any correspondence, memoranda, or other records that reflect the VA's input on or discussion of the language stating that decisions made under the proposed Partial Claim Program \"shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits.\" This could include, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Written comments, suggestions, or feedback provided by the VA on draft versions of the bill;\r\n\r\n2. Analyses prepared by the VA discussing the potential consequences of excluding Partial Claim Program decisions from the \"provision of benefits\" definition;\r\n\r\n3. Email communications between VA officials and Committee staff regarding these provisions;\r\n\r\n4. Minutes or notes from meetings where these issues were addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess to these records would greatly enhance my understanding of the legislative intent behind Sections 3723(f)(3) and 3732(f)(3) and the VA's role in shaping these provisions. This information is crucial for evaluating the full implications of the bill and ensuring that veterans' rights are adequately protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Committee is unable to provide these records directly, I kindly request that you refer me to the appropriate points of contact at the VA or other relevant agencies who may be able to assist with this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support and attention to this critical matter. I look forward to your response and any assistance you can provide in obtaining these important records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n(321) 506-9557<tel:(321)%20506-9557>\r\n\r\nmbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: HVAC Info <hvacinfo@mail.house.gov<mailto:hvacinfo@mail.house.gov>>\r\nSent: Monday, April 29, 2024 6:08 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov> <oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov>>; HVAC Info <hvacinfo@mail.house.gov<mailto:hvacinfo@mail.house.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Concerns Regarding Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood afternoon, Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to send this information to us.

Specifically, the language stating that decisions made under these sections \"shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits\" seems overly broad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the drafting of this bill, did the VA provide any technical assistance or express views on these judicial review provisions? If so, were the potential unintended consequences of diminishing veterans' procedural protections and appeal rights considered? I would appreciate any insight you can provide on the rationale behind this language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid an interpretation that erodes long-standing veteran rights, I respectfully suggest clarifying that the judicial review limitations in Sections 3723(f)(3) and 3732(f)(3) only apply to the new programs created by this Act. Expressly preserving veterans' full appeal rights for other home loan decisions would protect against undermining the important \"duty to assist\" and \"benefit of the doubt\" standards afforded to veterans in benefit cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile expanded loss mitigation options are critical, they should not come at the expense of essential legal protections for those who have served our nation. I appreciate your consideration of these concerns and proposed amendment. Please keep me apprised of any changes made to address this issue as the bill advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your work on behalf of our veterans. I would be happy to discuss this matter further at your convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Monday, April 22, 2024 3:02 PM\r\nTo: oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov>; HVAC Info <hvacinfo@mail.house.gov<mailto:hvacinfo@mail.house.gov>>\r\nSubject: Concerns Regarding the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Members of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Subcommittees,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Michael Locke, and I am a veteran writing to express my deep concern about a specific provision in the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" (S. 3728/H.R. [bill number]). As someone who has faced challenges with my VA-backed home loan, I believe that this bill, while well-intentioned, may ultimately harm veterans more than it helps them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problematic language appears in Section 2(b) of both the House and Senate versions of the bill, which adds a new Section 3723 to Title 38 of the U.S. Code. Under Section 3723(f)(3), the bill states: \"For purposes of section 511 of this title, any decision under this section shall not be treated as a decision under a law that affects the provision of benefits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis provision appears to limit the scope of judicial review for decisions made by the VA Secretary under the new Partial Claim Program. By excluding these decisions from being treated as decisions under laws affecting the provision of benefits, the bill seemingly restricts veterans' ability to challenge the VA's actions through the normal appeals process, including appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, veterans may be left without adequate recourse if the VA mishandles their case or fails to properly administer the new program. This lack of oversight and accountability could lead to veterans being denied the very protections and benefits the bill seeks to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI strongly urge the members of both subcommittees to reconsider this provision and amend the bill to ensure that veterans retain their full rights to appeal and challenge VA decisions related to their home loans. The VA should not be given unchecked authority, especially when it comes to matters as crucial as veterans' housing stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease take action to protect veterans' rights and ensure that the \"Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2024\" truly serves the best interests of those who have served our nation. I would be happy to provide further information about my personal experiences and discuss this matter in more detail with any of the subcommittee members or their staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue and for your commitment to supporting our nation's veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, March 19, 2024 11:08 AM\r\nTo: oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov> <oversight@vetaff.senate.gov<mailto:oversight@vetaff.senate.gov>>\r\nSubject: Urgent Concern Regarding Systemic Issues in the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to bring to your attention what I believe to be serious, systemic problems within the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Home Loan Guaranty program, as evidenced by my own experiences as a veteran struggling to obtain assistance with my VA-guaranteed home loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Michael Locke, and over the past few years, I have faced significant challenges in securing the protections and relief afforded to me under the CARES Act, VA Circular 26-20-12, and other applicable laws and regulations. Despite my repeated efforts to seek assistance from the VA and my loan servicer, Planet Home Lending, I have encountered a troubling pattern of inconsistency, lack of transparency, and apparent disregard for the VA's own policies and statutory obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the key issues I have faced include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The VA's failure to ensure that my loan servicer complied with the requirements of the CARES Act and VA Circular 26-20-12, including offering appropriate forbearance options and considering all possible home retention options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Inconsistent and contradictory information provided by VA representatives regarding the agency's ability to assist veterans with loans in active bankruptcy, despite clear evidence that the VA's own policies allow for such assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The VA's apparent failure to properly notify me of my appellate rights, as required by law, which may have prejudiced my ability to seek timely review and relief through the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The VA's reluctance to fulfill its statutory duty to assist me in obtaining critical documentation from my loan servicer to support my case, as mandated by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A and 38 CFR \u00a7 21.1032.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that these issues are not unique to my case, but rather indicative of broader, systemic problems within the VA's Home Loan Guaranty program that may be affecting countless other veterans nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs such, I respectfully request that the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Investigate the VA's oversight of loan servicers participating in the Home Loan Guaranty program, with a focus on their compliance with the CARES Act, VA Circular 26-20-12, and other relevant laws and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Examine the VA's policies, practices, and training regarding communication with veteran borrowers, including the accuracy and consistency of information provided by VA representatives and the agency's adherence to its statutory duty to assist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Review the VA's compliance with its legal obligations to notify veteran borrowers of their appellate rights and the impact of any failures to provide timely and accurate information on veterans' ability to challenge VA decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Consider legislative action to enhance protections for veteran borrowers, increase accountability and transparency within the VA's Home Loan Guaranty program, and ensure that veterans receive the benefits and assistance they have earned through their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also reached out to the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee regarding these concerns, as I believe that a coordinated, bicameral response is necessary to address the full scope of these issues and to protect the rights of veteran borrowers across the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that I am prepared to provide extensive documentation to support my claims, including correspondence with the VA, relevant laws and regulations, and evidence obtained through FOIA requests. I am grateful for your attention to this matter and stand ready to assist in any way possible to ensure that the VA is held accountable and that veterans receive the support and protection they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your service and your commitment to the well-being of our nation's veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n127 Delvalle St.\r\n\r\nMelbourne Beah, FL 32951\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Saturday, March 23, 2024 7:16 PM\r\n\r\nTo: Tanielian, Terri L.

Since our last communication, there have been some significant developments that I believe underscore the urgency and importance of addressing these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, I am pleased to inform you that the American Legion has agreed to represent me in my appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) regarding the VA's mishandling of my loan and its failure to ensure compliance with VA Circular 26-20-12. The American Legion's representatives, while not attorneys, are experienced advocates who are well-versed in navigating the VA appeals process and presenting compelling arguments on behalf of veteran borrowers. Their willingness to take on my case is a testament to the seriousness and validity of my concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, I recently received an email from VA representative Andrew Post requesting that I provide updated financial information to identify potential loss mitigation options. While I appreciate the VA's stated willingness to explore solutions, I found it troubling that Mr. Post's email failed to acknowledge the VA's role in creating the hardship I am currently facing, particularly its failure to ensure that my loan servicer complied with the CARES Act and VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response, I have informed Mr. Post that I cannot in good faith provide my financial information until the VA formally acknowledges its past failures, provides a clear plan for corrective action, and works with me to find a solution that addresses the harm caused by the agency's inadequate oversight. I believe this is a necessary step to hold the VA accountable and ensure that my rights as a veteran borrower are fully protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have brought to Mr. Post's attention the striking parallels between my case and the troubling patterns of VA inaction and neglect revealed in cases like Bibby v. Mortgage Investors Corporation and the recent VA OIG report on the agency's oversight of home loan defaults. These examples, along with the VA's denial of my FOIA request seeking records related to the agency's decision-making on disaster-area loan modifications, paint a picture of an agency that consistently prioritizes the interests of lenders over its duty to protect veteran borrowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe these developments only strengthen the case for urgent reform and accountability within the VA's Home Loan Guaranty program. The agency's failure to acknowledge and address its past mistakes, both in my case and in the broader context of its oversight responsibilities, is unacceptable and demands immediate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am grateful for your continued support and advocacy on behalf of veteran borrowers like myself. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide as I navigate this challenging process and work to hold the VA accountable for its legal and ethical obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you require any additional information or if there are any further steps I should take to advance my case and shine a light on the systemic issues within the VA's oversight of the Home Loan Guaranty program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again for your dedication to ensuring justice and fairness for our nation's veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Tanielian, Terri L.

I am writing to request your help in addressing what I believe to be serious, systemic problems within the VA's Home Loan Guaranty program that may be affecting countless veterans nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, I have faced significant challenges in securing the protections and relief afforded to me under the CARES Act, VA Circular 26-20-12, and other applicable laws and regulations. Despite my repeated efforts to seek assistance from the VA and my loan servicer, I have encountered a troubling pattern of inconsistency, lack of transparency, and apparent disregard for the VA's own policies and statutory obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the key issues I have faced include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The VA's failure to ensure that my loan servicer complied with the requirements of the CARES Act and VA Circular 26-20-12, including offering appropriate forbearance options and considering all possible home retention options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Inconsistent and contradictory information provided by VA representatives regarding the agency's ability to assist veterans with loans in active bankruptcy, despite clear evidence that the VA's own policies allow for such assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The VA's apparent failure to properly notify me of my appellate rights, as required by law, which may have prejudiced my ability to seek timely review and relief through the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The VA's reluctance to fulfill its statutory duty to assist me in obtaining critical documentation from my loan servicer to support my case, as mandated by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A and 38 CFR \u00a7 21.1032.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, as a veteran with combat-related PTSD, the stress and uncertainty surrounding my home loan situation have been significantly exacerbating my symptoms, despite my active participation in treatment for over 12 years. The VA's failure to provide adequate support and protection in this matter has not only put my home at risk but has also had a profound impact on my mental health and well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have reached out to both the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee and the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs regarding these concerns, as I believe that congressional intervention and investigation are necessary to address the full scope of these issues and to protect the rights of veteran borrowers across the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven your extensive background in veteran policy, mental health policy, and your experience working with the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, I believe that you are uniquely positioned to help address these systemic problems and to ensure that veterans like myself receive the support and protection they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any assistance or guidance you could provide in navigating these challenges and in bringing these issues to the attention of the relevant authorities within the VA and the White House. I am prepared to provide extensive documentation to support my claims, including correspondence with the VA, relevant laws and regulations, and evidence obtained through FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your service and your commitment to the well-being of our nation's veterans. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss these matters further and to work together to ensure that the VA is held accountable and that veteran borrowers, particularly those grappling with the ongoing effects of their service-connected disabilities, are treated fairly and equitably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n127 Delvalle St.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMelbourne Beah, FL 32951\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(321) 506-9557<tel:(321)%20506-9557>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To: Loan Guaranty Service\r\nI am writing to express my profound disappointment and disbelief at the blatant misrepresentations contained in the unsigned letter dated August 16, 2024, regarding my VA-guaranteed home loan. The lack of a named author is telling in itself, but the content of the letter raises even more serious concerns about the integrity and honesty of the VA Loan Guaranty Service. It seems the department is more interested in evading accountability than in engaging with the legitimate issues I've raised.\r\nYou claim that I am demanding a direct payment of $27,000 from the VA. This is utterly false. I have never made such a demand in my appeal or any correspondence. My argument, clearly outlined in my appeal documents, is for the VA to cover the $27,000 payment as equitable relief, a legal concept you seem to conveniently ignore. This payment obligation arose directly from the court-ordered sale of my home, which was triggered by the very failures in oversight and mismanagement that I have meticulously detailed in my appeal.\r\nFurthermore, in your July 5th, 2024 letter you stated that Planet Home Lending was \"considering another loan modification\" when I filed for bankruptcy, implying that the servicer was acting in good faith and that bankruptcy disrupted a potential solution. How can \"you\" make such a claim when Planet Home Lending's own attorney, Matt Wasinger, testified in court that my property was at imminent risk of foreclosure with no options to save it?\r\nThis blatant contradiction, supported by the court order forcing the sale of my home, exposes the absurdity of \"your\" assertion. It is inconceivable that you are unaware of these legal proceedings, which are central to understanding the true circumstances of my case.\r\nThe contradictions and misrepresentations in \"your\" letters are particularly troubling considering that I have already provided the BVA with comprehensive documentation, including court records and correspondence, that clearly refutes your narrative. It seems that the Loan Guaranty Service is either willfully ignoring the evidence or failing to conduct even a basic review of the materials already submitted. This complete disregard for the facts of my case further reinforces the need for a thorough and impartial investigation by the Board of Veterans' Appeals.\r\nMy struggle with the VA loan guaranty is rooted in a family history marked by military service and bureaucratic challenges. From my grandfather's death due to World War II injuries to my father's tours in Vietnam, our family has been shaped by service and its aftermath. I believe these experiences have left epigenetic imprints, influencing my heightened awareness of systemic issues and determination to assert my rights. This unique perspective, born from generations of sacrifice and navigating government systems, drives my approach to the current VA process. I'm not just advocating for myself, but carrying forward a legacy of resilience, aiming to break cycles of bureaucratic neglect and ensure promises made to veterans are honored. In essence, my situation reflects a broader struggle to reconcile personal rights with a complex heritage of service and institutional interactions.\nMichael Locke",

In a limited analysis of just 11 loans from one regional loan center serviced by a single nationwide servicer, the OIG found that the servicer attempted to modify 5 of these loans (45%) at interest rates higher than allowed by VA policy following forbearance. In one example, a servicer tried to increase a fixed interest rate from 3.25% to 5%, far exceeding the VA's limit of no more than 1% above the existing rate. This high error rate suggests a potentially widespread problem that could negatively impact vulnerable borrowers in disaster areas.\r\n\r\nDespite this concerning finding, the OIG made no formal recommendations regarding disaster loan modifications. The Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) informed the OIG that it had conducted a preliminary risk analysis, which they claimed did not necessitate a formal risk assessment. However, the report provides no details on LGY's methodology or specific findings that led to this conclusion. The LGY quality assurance chief mentioned existing and new controls for reviewing suspicious loan modifications, but offered no specifics on how these controls address the high error rate identified by the OIG. This lack of transparency and the absence of a formal OIG recommendation, despite the potentially serious nature of the issue, raises questions about whether this problem is receiving adequate attention and oversight.\r\n\r\nWould you guys (VBA Loan Guaranty Service) mind obtaining copies of the incomplete loss mitigation package submitted for my home loan on 12/3/2019? For some reason, my servicer Planet Home Lending, has made it unavailable to me. It\u2019s been a while, so I\u2019m not completely sure, but feel pretty strongly it will shed light on my reason for default.\r\n\nMichael Locke",

I am writing to request assistance in obtaining a complete copy of my Borrower's Assistance Package, which I submitted to Planet Home Lending on December 3, 2019.\r\nI am in possession of the Receipt of Borrower's Assistance Package dated December 3, 2019, acknowledging receipt of the package. A copy of this receipt is included with this letter for your reference. However, despite repeated requests, Planet Home Lending has refused to provide me with a copy of the actual package contents. This refusal is particularly concerning as there is a dispute regarding the default cause of my loan. My submitted Borrower's Assistance Package included a dedicated section for \"hardship explanation\" which directly addresses this dispute and is critical to clarifying the circumstances surrounding my loan's delinquency.\r\nFurthermore, I have requested written confirmation from Planet Home Lending stating their refusal to provide the package, but they have declined this request as well.\r\nThis lack of transparency hinders my ability to understand the basis for past decisions made regarding my loan, to demonstrate the true cause of the default, and to effectively participate in any loss mitigation efforts. Access to my complete Borrower's Assistance Package, including the \"hardship explanation,\" is vital to resolving this dispute and ensuring a fair and accurate assessment of my situation.\r\nGiven the VA's duty to assist claimants under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, I request your intervention in this matter. Specifically, I ask that you:\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nDirect Planet Home Lending to provide me with a complete copy of my Borrower's Assistance Package submitted on December 3, 2019.\r\n  2.\r\nInstruct Planet Home Lending to provide me with written documentation confirming their refusal to provide the package, if they maintain their stance.\r\n\r\nAs further context for the hardship I experienced, I was subject to a mandatory evacuation order issued by Brevard County on August 31, 2019, due to the impending threat of Hurricane Dorian. A copy of this order is attached for your reference. The financial impact of this evacuation significantly affected my ability to stay current on my mortgage payments. This information is directly relevant to the \"hardship explanation\" section of my Borrower's Assistance Package, which is why obtaining a complete copy of the package is crucial to accurately representing the circumstances surrounding my loan's default.\r\nI believe that access to this documentation is essential for transparency and fairness in the handling of my loan. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\r\nMichael Locke",

In a limited analysis of just 11 loans from one regional loan center serviced by a single nationwide servicer, the OIG found that the servicer attempted to modify 5 of these loans (45%) at interest rates higher than allowed by VA policy following forbearance. In one example, a servicer tried to increase a fixed interest rate from 3.25% to 5%, far exceeding the VA's limit of no more than 1% above the existing rate. This high error rate suggests a potentially widespread problem that could negatively impact vulnerable borrowers in disaster areas.\r\n\r\nDespite this concerning finding, the OIG made no formal recommendations regarding disaster loan modifications. The Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) informed the OIG that it had conducted a preliminary risk analysis, which they claimed did not necessitate a formal risk assessment. However, the report provides no details on LGY's methodology or specific findings that led to this conclusion. The LGY quality assurance chief mentioned existing and new controls for reviewing suspicious loan modifications, but offered no specifics on how these controls address the high error rate identified by the OIG. This lack of transparency and the absence of a formal OIG recommendation, despite the potentially serious nature of the issue, raises questions about whether this problem is receiving adequate attention and oversight.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n[image/png]\r\nWould you guys (VBA Loan Guaranty Service) mind obtaining copies of the incomplete loss mitigation package submitted for my home loan on 12/3/2019? For some reason, my servicer Planet Home Lending, has made it unavailable to me. It\u2019s been a while, so I\u2019m not completely sure, but feel pretty strongly it will shed light on my reason for default.\r\n\nMichael Locke",

My case is currently being monitored by multiple offices, including the Office of the Secretary , and involves several key issues:\r\n\r\n1. Documentation discrepancies regarding my initial default reason (disaster-related hardship from Hurricane Dorian in December 2019 vs. subsequent characterization as marital difficulties)\r\n\r\n2. Questions about forbearance periods and their proper recording in VALERI\r\n\r\n3. The need to resolve a $27,000 settlement with my ex-wife to retain the property\r\n\r\nThe November 13 letter appears to suggest a potential path forward through VA's direct intervention that wasn't contemplated in earlier responses. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how we might structure a solution that addresses both the settlement amount and establishes a sustainable payment plan moving forward.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what documentation you need from me to begin this process.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "I am writing in response to the VA's letter dated November 13, 2024, which suggests the possibility of the VA directly purchasing and restructuring my loan. While I appreciate this potential path forward, I must address several concerning inaccuracies and contradictions in your letter that directly impact my ability to access appropriate relief.\r\n\r\n1. Misapplication of Disaster Modification Requirements and Systemic Oversight Issues\r\n\r\nYour letter continues to defend Planet Home Lending's (PHL) position regarding verification requirements for the Disaster Modification. This position fundamentally misunderstands the VA's own rules, regulations, and guidelines and reflects broader systemic issues in VA's oversight of disaster-related assistance.\r\n\r\nThe VA Servicer Handbook M26-4 explicitly states that \"Servicer evaluation of the borrower's financial information is not required for a disaster modification.\" Instead, the manual establishes that successful completion of a 3-month Trial Payment Plan (TPP) is the mechanism for demonstrating a borrower's ability to sustain the modified payment. This makes perfect sense\u2014what better way to verify that the \"hardship was resolved\" than through three consecutive monthly payments?\r\n\r\nThe irony of this misapplication is particularly stark given the findings of the VA Office of Inspector General's September 30, 2019, audit report (No. 18-03979-204) titled \"Oversight and Resolution of Home Loan Defaults.\" This audit, released the same month as my initial default, identified a 45% error rate in disaster loan modifications\u2014the highest specific error rate cited for any aspect of the VA's home loan program oversight. Despite this alarming finding, the OIG notably did not offer specific recommendations, instead deferring to VBA Loan Guaranty's internal \"preliminary risk assessment,\" which determined no further action was needed.\r\n\r\nMy case appears to exemplify the very issues identified in this audit. PHL created extra-regulatory requirements by demanding financial verification that the M26-4 Manual explicitly states isn't needed, while the VA failed to correct this misapplication despite having clear evidence of it. This reflects not just an isolated error but a systemic failure to implement proper disaster-related assistance\u2014a failure the VA was aware of through its own OIG audit but failed to address.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, section 5.05(e)(4)(e) of the M26-4 Manual states that submitting a complete loss mitigation application would actually make a borrower ineligible for the Disaster Modification. While PHL appears to have created barriers to accessing the Disaster Modification by demanding verification that \"the hardship was resolved, the borrower returned to work, and with no negative long-term change in the household income,\" the TPP itself was designed to serve as this verification mechanism. PHL's apparent imposition of additional requirements before offering a TPP seems to contradict the program's core design, where the TPP itself demonstrates the borrower's ability to sustain payments.\r\n\r\nCritical Questions:\r\n\r\n- How does the VA justify supporting PHL\u2019s additional verification requirements that contradict the M26-4 Manual?\r\n- What steps will the VA take to rectify the systemic oversight failures highlighted by the OIG audit?\r\n\r\n2. Persistent Mischaracterization of Default Reason and Delayed Acknowledgment of Disaster Hardship\r\n\r\nYour letter finally acknowledges the December 2019 disaster hardship that I have repeatedly documented. However, this acknowledgment comes after over two years of persistent mischaracterization of the default reason in VA records, despite clear evidence provided as early as June 22, 2022.\r\n\r\nOn that date, I submitted Planet Home Lending's CFPB response, which unequivocally confirmed the disaster hardship beginning December 3, 2019. This documentation was shared with the following VA officials:\r\n- Marcus Young, Loan Administration Officer\r\n- Andrew Post, VBA LGY Program Manager\r\n- Jennifer Toth, Assistant Director for Loan Administration Field\r\n\r\nFor over two years, despite having this evidence, the VA failed to acknowledge the documented disaster hardship. This delay contributed to significant harm, including the inability to access disaster-related assistance in a timely manner and adverse consequences for my credit and financial stability.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the VA's eventual acknowledgment, this delay raises concerns about systemic failures in updating VA records, holding servicers accountable for accurate reporting, and ensuring compliance with the counseling, forbearance, and assistance mandates outlined in 38 U.S. Code \u00a7 3720(f).\r\n\r\nCritical Questions:\r\n- What steps is the VA taking to correct the two-year delay in acknowledging my December 2019 disaster hardship?\r\n- How does the VA plan to ensure timely and accurate acknowledgment of disaster hardships for other veterans to prevent similar delays?\r\n\r\n3. Unresolved COVID-19 Forbearance Documentation and Oversight Issues\r\n\r\nThe serious discrepancies regarding my COVID-19 forbearance remain unaddressed. Your letter doesn't explain:\r\n\r\nTimeline Discrepancies:\r\n- PHL claims COVID-19 forbearance from May 2020 through August 2021.\r\n- VALERI records show different dates for special forbearance periods.\r\n- Neither VA nor PHL has provided documentation reconciling these differences.\r\n\r\nVALERI Documentation Issues:\r\n- Why wasn't my loan marked as COVID-19-affected until May 10, 2022?\r\n- How did this delay impact my access to COVID-19 relief options?\r\n- Why did Jacob Eilbert need to inquire about forbearance classification in June 2024 if proper documentation existed?\r\n\r\nPHL Response to Eilbert's Inquiry:\r\n- Has the VA received a response from Planet Home Lending regarding Jacob Eilbert's June 11, 2024, inquiry on whether the forbearances in VALERI were COVID-related?\r\n- If the VA has not received a response, what follow-up actions have been taken to obtain this information?\r\n- If a response has been received, will the VA please provide documentation demonstrating PHL's response to Eilbert's inquiry?\r\n\r\n\r\nThese aren't merely administrative oversights. The court relied on PHL's representations about foreclosure risk\u2014representations that may have been inaccurate given these documentation discrepancies. VA's failure to properly oversee and document my COVID-19 forbearance directly contributed to the court order to sell my home.\r\n\r\nCritical Questions Requiring Response:\r\n- Will the VA provide complete VALERI records showing all forbearance periods and their classifications?\r\n- Can the VA explain why its records differ from PHL's reported forbearance timeline?\r\n- What oversight actions did the VA take when these discrepancies were first brought to its attention over two years ago?\r\n- How did the VA ensure my COVID-19 protections weren't compromised by the delayed VALERI designation?\r\n- Has the VA received a response from Planet Home Lending regarding Jacob Eilbert's June 11, 2024, inquiry on whether the forbearances in VALERI were COVID-related? If not, what follow-up actions have been taken? If so, will the VA please provide documentation demonstrating PHL's response?\r\n\r\n4. Unacceptable Path Forward and Demand for Immediate Regional Reassignment\r\n\r\nYour suggestion to work with VA Loan Technician Louis Krejci is deeply concerning given the documented oversight failures detailed above. Mr. Krejci and his supervisors have been directly involved in:\r\n- The persistent mischaracterization of my December 2019 disaster hardship.\r\n- The mishandling of COVID-19 forbearance documentation.\r\n- The misinterpretation of refunding referral requirements under Circular 26-20-12.\r\n- The misapplication of Disaster Modification requirements.\r\n\r\nDirecting me back to the same officials who have demonstrated a pattern of misapplying VA rules, regulations, and guidelines and failing to acknowledge documented facts is unacceptable and will not resolve the issues at hand.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as a Florida veteran with a Florida property, it is neither practical nor appropriate for my loan to be overseen by the Phoenix Regional Loan Center. The St. Petersburg VBA Regional Office and Regional Loan Center are better positioned to handle my case given:\r\n- Geographic proximity for property-related matters.\r\n- Local knowledge of Florida disaster impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, I DEMAND the immediate reassignment of my loan servicing to the St. Petersburg Regional Loan Center. This reassignment is crucial for ensuring proper oversight, preventing further documentation discrepancies, and facilitating a resolution based on accurate and compliant application of VA rules, regulations, and guidelines.\r\n\r\n5. Misrepresentation of My Claim Regarding COVID Protections\r\n\r\nI must stress that VBA Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) continues to misrepresent the basis of my claim. My claim does not concern eligibility for the COVID-19 Partial Claim Program or the COVID-19 Refund Modification. Instead, my claim directly pertains to the substantive rights established under VA Circular 26-20-12 and the harm caused by its improper rescission.\r\n\r\nCircular 26-20-12 created binding obligations for servicers, including:\r\n- Mandatory forbearance upon borrower request.\r\n- Prohibitions on foreclosure actions during the forbearance period.\r\n- Clear instructions that missed payments would be moved to the end of the loan term.\r\n\r\nThese provisions established enforceable rights that borrowers like myself relied upon for housing stability during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rescission of Circular 26-20-12 improperly stripped veterans of these protections without justification or adequate alternative measures, leaving us vulnerable to financial harm, foreclosure, and unjust loan modifications.\r\n\r\nThe VA\u2019s continued conflation of my claim with unrelated COVID-19 programs like the Partial Claim and Refund Modification detracts from the core issue. My claim is centered on the VA\u2019s failure to uphold the mandatory protections provided by Circular 26-20-12 and the subsequent harm caused by its rescission. The VA\u2019s actions violated the principles outlined in *Fugere v. Derwinski*, 972 F.2d 331, 332 (Fed. Cir. 1992), which mandate that substantive veterans' rights cannot be dismissed through procedural changes or rescissions.\r\n\r\nTo further address this issue, I am submitting a supplemental claim to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (BVA) as part of my pending appeal. This supplemental claim argues that:\r\n- The rescission of Circular 26-20-12 violated *Fugere v. Derwinski*, 972 F.2d 331, 332 (Fed. Cir. 1992) by removing substantive rights without procedural due process or adequate replacement protections.\r\n- Circular 26-20-12\u2019s protections must be retroactively reinstated to address the harm caused during the rescission period.\r\n- Systemic reforms are necessary to ensure the VA cannot unilaterally rescind substantive rights without transitional safeguards.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that the VA:\r\n- Acknowledge that my claim is distinct from the COVID-19 programs mentioned in your 11/13/2024 letter and pertains solely to the substantive rights established under Circular 26-20-12.\r\n- Recognize the systemic harm caused by rescinding Circular 26-20-12 and take corrective action to protect veterans who were unfairly impacted.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on these substantive rights and the broader systemic implications, I aim not only to resolve my own case but also to help ensure that other veterans are afforded the protections they deserve.\r\n\r\nPath Forward\r\n\r\nI remain committed to resolving this matter in a way that allows me to retain my home while ensuring adherence to the VA's rules, regulations, and guidelines. While I welcome the suggestion of a direct purchase and restructuring, it must be implemented based on accurate documentation and compliance with the VA's rules, regulations, and guidelines. To move forward effectively:\r\n\r\n1. The VA must provide clear answers to the critical questions outlined in this letter regarding discrepancies in disaster modification requirements, forbearance documentation, and oversight failures.\r\n2. Immediate reassignment of my loan servicing to the St. Petersburg Regional Loan Center is essential to ensure proper oversight and local jurisdiction for my case.\r\n3. The VA must acknowledge and address systemic issues with oversight, including those identified in the OIG audit, to prevent future harm to veterans.\r\n4. Any resolution must explicitly recognize my rights under Circular 26-20-12, with retroactive corrections applied as necessary.\r\n5. I demand that all future communications regarding this matter be sent electronically. The November 13, 2024, letter was sent via regular mail, which caused unnecessary delays in receiving and addressing this critical correspondence.\r\n\r\nBy addressing these points, the VA can not only resolve my individual case but also demonstrate a commitment to systemic improvements that safeguard veterans' housing stability. I am available to discuss this matter further and collaborate on a resolution that protects my rights and home.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Houk,\r\n\r\nI understand you've been assigned as my new VA loan technician as of November 13, 2024. I'm following up on the VA's November 13 letter suggesting working with my loan technician to explore VA's direct purchase and restructuring of my loan.\r\n\r\nAs extensively documented in my communications with VA Loan Guaranty since July 2024 and my now-docketed BVA appeal (240612-487471), the $27,000 payment to my ex-wife stems directly from VA's oversight failures regarding my forbearance periods and servicing issues. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(a)(2)(A), this obligation falls within VA's authority to address as part of any loan resolution. While the November 13 letter proposed direct VA intervention through loan purchase and restructuring, it did not address this critical component that has been consistently raised in my communications with VA.\r\n\r\nGiven this context, I would appreciate discussing how we might structure a solution through direct VA intervention that addresses both the loan restructuring and the settlement amount needed to resolve my ex-wife's interest in the property.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what documentation you need from me to begin this process.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nMichael Locke\r\nLoan # 171761792052",

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is currently considering purchasing my loan as part of their loan refund program, as evidenced by their letter dated November 21, 2024. However, Planet Home Lending's actions are actively jeopardizing this process.\r\n\r\nBackground and Current Situation:\r\n\r\n1. The VA has confirmed they are actively reviewing my loan for purchase through their temporary Veterans Assistance Program (tVAP), as documented in recent communications from VA Loan Servicing Officer Phillip Houk dated December 17, 2024.\r\n\r\n2. This VA review is now being directly threatened by Planet Home Lending's actions stemming from misrepresentations made by your counsel, Matthew Wasinger, in Florida state court (Case #05-2017-DR-054881).\r\n\r\nSpecific Issues Requiring Immediate Resolution:\r\n\r\n1. Misrepresentation of VA Policy\r\nYour attorney, Matthew Wasinger, provided testimony in state court on May 25, 2022, that directly contradicted established VA policy regarding loan refunds. This testimony, as documented in the official Court Minutes, led to an order compelling the sale of my property. This directly conflicts with:\r\n\r\n   a) Federal Register document #2020-26964, which explicitly stated VA's policy regarding loan refunds at the time of Wasinger's testimony\r\n   b) The VA's current active consideration of purchasing my loan, as evidenced by their November 21, 2024 letter\r\n\r\n2. Incomplete Document Production\r\nYou have failed to provide:\r\n   - Collection records from November 1, 2019, through September 1, 2022\r\n   - Call logs and notes\r\n   - Communication records\r\n   - Servicing notes\r\n   - Customer service interaction records\r\n   - Hardship/loss mitigation related communications\r\n   - Information regarding forbearances and their relation to the COVID-19 pandemic\r\n\r\nRequired Immediate Actions:\r\n\r\n1. Legal Resolution\r\n   - Take immediate legal action to correct the misrepresentations made by your counsel in Case #05-2017-DR-054881\r\n   - File appropriate motions to stay any forced sale pending VA's review\r\n   - Provide accurate information to the court regarding VA's loan purchase policies\r\n\r\n2. Document Production\r\n   - Immediately provide all previously requested documents\r\n   - Include complete records of all loss mitigation efforts\r\n   - Provide full documentation of all COVID-19 related forbearance discussions\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanet Home Lending bears full responsibility for resolving this situation, which was created by your counsel's misrepresentations and your subsequent failure to take corrective action. Your actions have placed both my property and the VA's intended purchase of my loan in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThe VA's policy regarding loan refunds is clear and well-documented in Federal Register document #2020-26964. Your counsel's testimony directly contradicted this policy, and your subsequent actions have failed to acknowledge or correct this error. This situation requires immediate resolution to prevent further harm to my interests and to allow the VA's purchase process to proceed unimpeded.\r\n\r\nI expect a complete and detailed response within five (5) business days outlining the specific steps you will take to resolve these issues. Your response should include a timeline for implementation and the name of a specific point of contact who will be responsible for ensuring these actions are completed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\nLoan #91002007812\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 31, 2024 2:22 PM\r\nTo: Mitigation@planethomelending.com <Mitigation@planethomelending.com>; cs@myloansupport.com <cs@myloansupport.com>\r\nSubject: Document Request - Loan #91002007812\r\n\r\nTo whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nI was told by the VA hotline that on 9/3/2024 someone from Veterans Benefits Affairs Loan Guaranty directed Planet Home Lending to provide needed documents for my Board of Veterans Appeals appeal.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following documents for loan #91002007812:\r\n\r\n1. Planet Home Lending's response to Jacob Eilbert's (VBASPL) June 11, 2024 inquiry regarding whether my forbearances (approved 8/19/2020, extended 12/10/2020 and 4/2/2021) were COVID-related\r\n\r\n2.

The actual timeline is:\r\n\r\n- Original FOIA Request: September 11, 2023 (FOIA #23-12977-F)\r\n- Initial Agency Decision: January 16, 2024\r\n- My Appeal: March 20, 2024\r\n- OGC Appeal Remand: June 25, 2024 (OGC Case #169943, Appeal #24-00097-AR)\r\n\r\nThe VA Office of General Counsel granted my appeal and remanded the case over 7 months ago, ordering:\r\n1. A thorough reconsideration of my request\r\n2. A renewed search for responsive information\r\n3. A description of the search process\r\n4. Review of all responsive information\r\n5. Issuance of a new Initial Agency Decision\r\n\r\nYour response appears to confuse my FOIA appeal with a benefits claim. This is a FOIA request for specific records related to the FY 2019 risk assessment of home loans in disaster areas. The VA has already identified 25 pages of responsive email records.\r\n\r\nPlease provide:\r\n1. The current status of the remanded FOIA request\r\n2. An estimated completion date\r\n3. The name of the FOIA Officer handling the remand\r\n\r\nFor reference, the remand letter CC'd:\r\n- Olaiseh Wambui, VBACO FOIA Officer\r\n- Angela Davis, Supervisory FOIA Officer\r\n- Darryl L.

        "communication": "Good afternoon Ms. Miller,\r\n\r\nWe have received the request you submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for:\r\n    1. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the words \"Omicron\" and/or \"B.1.1.529\" and/or \"GR/484A\" and/or \"21K\" between the dates of 1/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n    2. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"breakthrough\" between the dates of 1/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n    3. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"effectiveness\" between the dates of 1/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\nBased on past searches of Dr. Fauci's emails, this request will be exceedingly voluminous.  Please be advised that there is an extensive backlog at this time and the FOIA requires us to process requests in the order they were received.  Also, because of Dr. Fauci's dual role, requests for his emails must also be reviewed by NIH, HHS, and the White House prior to release. Thus, defining your search parameters as narrowly as possible will assist us in getting materials to you as timely as possible.  Suggestions for narrowing this request include: amending the request to emails sent by Dr. Fauci (this will mostly exclude spam and news clips and will better target Dr. Fauci's actual communications on a subject); reducing the time frame from over a year to two to four weeks or less; and excluding attachments. Broad terms like \"effectiveness\" seldom generate useful results unless combines with other limiting terms.  Combining terms to target a request to a specific area rather than just requesting tens of thousands of pages has been an effective strategy for our successful requesters.  For example:\r\nAll emails sent by Dr. Fauci for the time period <recommend 2-4 weeks> containing the terms ((\"Omicron\" OR \"B.1.1.529\" OR \"GR/484A\" OR \"21K\") AND \"breakthrough\") excluding attachments.\r\nLastly, I again ask you to kindly provide links to material supporting your request to be classified as a \"freelance journalist\" and therefore not subject to fees.  The search fees for this search will be significant so I will await your response to request the search.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRobin L.

All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the words \"Omicron\" and/or \"B.1.1.529\" and/or \"GR/484A\" and/or \"21K\" between the dates of 10/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\n2. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"breakthrough\" between the dates of 10/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\n3. All emails sent to or from Anthony Fauci (NIAID Director/Chief Medical Advisor to the White House) that include the word \"effectiveness\" between the dates of 10/1/2021 and the date this request is ultimately processed. Please include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\nNone of the search terms cited in this request should be interpreted by your agency as being case sensitive during the search and retrieval process while fulfilling this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents and information will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a freelance journalist whose work is frequently published in print and online by news outlets and magazines at the local, regional and national levels. As a member of the media, I request a waiver of all fees. Because more than a year has elapsed since my request was submitted on 12/21/2021, I expect that your office will provide all of the requested records at no charge, as required by federal law regardless of my media status.\r\n\r\nBecause my request was filed over two years ago, I also expect that your office will provide the requested records as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlese feel free to contact me at this email address if you need any additional information, or if you have any questions. Because this request has taken so long, I prefer that all communications regarding my request be in writing moving forward, in case I need to pursue legal action against your office to obtain the requested records.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Miller",

This investigation is known to have used mail covers. The following file numbers are associated with Penetrate: 65-HQ-67842, 65-SJ-398, 65-MM-2940. The HQ file number is also cited in previously released records on MIRA, which potentially identify Penetrate as Filiberto Inocencio Ojeda-Rios, the subject of a 1970 fugitive case (https://archive.org/details/MovimentoIndependentistaRevolucionarioEnArmas/SJ-100-12315_4_04_70/page/n75/mode/2up).\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.

EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a03.3(b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i), & (j) information (automatic declassification exemption), including the particular subparagraphs claimed to be applicable, and the applicable details (such as explanations of exemption, date exempted, exempting authority, etc)\r\nm. all other classification metadata, such as \"derived from\" markers (see e.g. EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a02.1), foreign classifications (see e.g. EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a01.6(e)), etc.\r\nn. the FOIA identifiers of every request made which covered that record\r\n\r\n2. all classification guides within the meaning of EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06.1(h), together with their unique record identifiers\r\n3. all declassification guides within the meaning of EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06.1(n), together with their unique record identifiers\r\n\r\n\r\nFor item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please either substitute the text \"created before Jan. 1, 2016\" with \"classified before Jan. 1, 2016\" or ignore the text \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" \u2014 i.e. you may construe the relevant date as the date of classification rather than the date of record creation (if you don't have the latter but have the former), and you may have false positives (additionally disclosing the classification metadata of records that are from 2016 or later), but you may not have false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2016, e.g. because your search fails to include classification metadata about records whose creation date you didn't track).\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you do not have item 1 records in a spreadsheet or database format, please provide records that would most closely approximate it \u2014 i.e. comprising a bulk index of classification information that would be useful for making FOIA requests of records whose classification has expired \u2014 such as (in decreasing order of preference) records compiled for the purpose of conducting (or for the then-future conduction of) declassification or declassification review under EO 13526, such as \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03.3, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 automatic, systematic, or mandatory declassification; classification logs; record indices; record cover sheets; or the like.\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* EO 13526 requires you to already be automatically and systematically compiling and acting on the records in item 1, and to centrally store the records in items 1 & 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Sai:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on November 4, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201call other\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  Your fee waiver request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2025-DA-01536-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Gina Lee at (202) 692-5228 or electronically at Gina.Lee@usda.gov<mailto:Gina.Lee@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>.

Your request was received in this office on 8/23/2024. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-ICFO-55733.

The files I'm mentioning are:\r\nFrom November Emails:\r\nSV223390163_911_Call.wav\r\nSV223390165_911_Call.wav\r\n[...]\r\nSV223410234_911_Call.wav\r\n\r\nWhereas the second batch of calls and radio traffic you provided (December emails) came with both 911 calls as well as the radio traffic, the above batch of calls did not. For example:\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390177_911_Call.wav.m4a\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390177_Radio_Traffic.wav.m4a\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390185_911_Call.wav.m4a\r\n(Redaction)_SV223390185_Radio_Traffic.wav.m4a\r\n\r\nThe Radio Traffic portion seems to be missing. Did it hopefully get processed and saved somewhere accessible, but possibly just not attached? If the files can be found, please attach them when you can.\r\n\r\nIf the files are no longer available, I'm not going to request that you re-work this request, rest assured. However, I am hopeful that the other data may be available and that this might just have an easy resolution!\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well,\r\nTake care.",

Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file. \r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel \r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow \r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/peter.fugiel/140788/2024-08-01_C169558_Fugiel-LEG_Seattle-Council-select-metadata.csv \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-council-219%252Fselect-secure-scheduling-council-emails-170805%252F%253Femail%253Dmuckrockseattle%252540mycusthelp.net&url_auth_token=AAAbJQToMIQHI1KMRcuzZrve4-c%3A1sZjGp%3AGHU1GXum0pus9tCKOc9CIy8O4-AZfCBLGClic8gMa1s \r\nThe records being made available to you at this time include 2/3rds of the records you indicated. \r\nTo download your records, please: \r\n \r\n  * Navigate to the Public Records Request Center. \r\n  * Select 'My Records Request Center'. \r\n  * Select 'View My Requests'.

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is November 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Dear Kristopher Rios:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on June 14, 2024. The request was originally submitted to the Department of Veteran Affairs, who then routed the request to the OIA.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201call other\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2024-REE-05419-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Mr. Nicholas Mantzaris electronically at Nicholas.Mantzaris@usda.gov<mailto:Nicholas.Mantzaris@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DABE63.025B0450]\r\nNicholas Mantzaris\r\nFOIA Analyst - Contractor\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\n1400 Independence Ave., SW, Room 4049D\r\nWashington, DC 20250\r\n(202) 690-5228\r\n\u2709     Nicholas.Mantzaris@USDA.gov<mailto:Nicholas.Mantzaris@USDA.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.
