Upon arrival at the intersection of Victory Boulevard and Bellingham Avenue, officers encountered an armed man with a firearm. The man pointed his gun at the officers, leading to an exchange of gunfire as the officers exited their vehicles. The motive for the shooting is currently unclear.\r\n\r\nThe armed man fled the scene, running north on Bellingham Avenue toward a parking structure behind a gym. Officers established a perimeter around the area. The man emerged from the west side of the parking structure on St. Claire Avenue, south of Hamlin Street, where a second exchange of gunfire occurred between him and the officers.\r\n\r\nThe man then re-entered the parking structure and exited from the north side, resulting in a third gunfire exchange. The sequence of who fired first in each of the three encounters remains unclear.\r\n\r\nThe armed man was struck by gunfire and pronounced dead at the scene. Additionally, a bystander found in his car within the parking structure was discovered deceased from a gunshot wound. It is currently undetermined whether the bystander was involved in the gunfire exchange.\r\n\r\nThe identities of both the armed gunman and the bystander have not been released.\r\n\r\nFurther Investigation: The LAPD is continuing to investigate the circumstances leading up to and during the shooting. Further details will be provided as they become available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGreg Robinson",
