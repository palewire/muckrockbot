        "communication": "Dear Nathan Raybeck:\r\n\r\nUnder the West Virginia Freedom of Information Act, \u00a729-B-1-1 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that detail the use or allocation of opioid lawsuit settlement funds in Preston County and outline an application for these funds. I am also requesting any documentation related to the review or approval process for these funds, including the names of individuals involved.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting documentation of the amount of funds Preston County has received so far, the application process to apply for funding, the individuals who will review the funding applications, the process by which funds will be awarded, how much funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of West Virginia\u2019s allocations of opioid settlement funds. I am a representative of the news media and my request is related to news gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. You can call me at 304-216-6743 or send me an email at heiskell.hannah@gmail.com. My physical address is 1511 University Ave. Morgantown, WV, 26505.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nHannah Heiskell\r\n304-216-6743\r\nheiskell.hannah@gmail.com",
