(Rule 10.500(e)(8).)\r\nFinally, if the Court determines that your request seeks disclosable judicial administrative records in the Court\u2019s possession, it may provide them as they become available, rather than delaying disclosure until all are available (\u201crolling disclosure\u201d).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJessica Kellogg, MPP (pronouns she/her)\r\n\r\nCommunications Program Manager\r\n\r\nSuperior Court of California, County of Santa Clara\r\n\r\n(408) 334-9236 | jkellogg@scscourt.org<mailto:jkellogg@scscourt.org>\n",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Alexander-Mullen:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt by the Department of Corrections (the Department) of your written request for records under the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law (RTKL).  Your request was received by this office via email on March 21, 2025. A copy of your request is attached to this email.\r\n\r\nThe Department only maintains a very limited amount of information responsive to your request.  The information that the Department does maintain is available on the Department's website at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/cor/offices-and-bureaus/office-of-county-inspections-and-services/inspections-and-statistics.html\r\n\r\nOther than what is available on the Department's website at the above link, your request is denied for the following reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   The record(s) that you requested do not currently exist in the possession of the Department of Corrections.  When responding to a request for access, an agency is not required to create a record which does not currently exist or to compile, format or organize a public record in a manner in which it does not currently compile, format or organize the public record.  65 P.S. \u00a7 67.705; See Moore v. Office of Open Records, 992 A.2d 907, 909 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010)(\"The Department cannot grant access to a record that does not exist.  Because under the current RTKL the Department cannot be made to create a record which does not exist, the OOR properly denied [the] ... appeal.\"); See also Bargeron v. Department of Labor and Industry, 720 A.2d 500 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1998).  See also McGowan v. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 103 A.3d 374, 382-83 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) (\"In the absence of any competent evidence that the agency acted in bad faith or that the agency records exist, \"the averments in the [d]epartment's affidavits should be accepted as true.\").\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the County Correctional Facilities are not part of the Department of Corrections and we only maintain a limited amount of information pertaining to these facilities as explained above.  You may be able to obtain some or all the information you are seeking not included on the Department's website by submitting a request to the Lancaster County Prison.\r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above denial of information in writing to the Executive Director, Office of Open Records (OOR), 333 Market Street, 16th Floor, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17101.  If you choose to file an appeal you must do so within 15 business days of the mailing date of this response and send to the OOR:\r\n\r\n1)   this response;  2)   your request; and 3)  the reason why you think the agency is wrong in its reasons for saying that the record is not public (a statement that addresses any ground stated by the agency for the denial).  If the agency gave several reasons why the record is not public, state which ones you think were wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso, the OOR has an appeal form available on the OOR website at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openrecords.pa.gov/RTKL/Forms.cfm.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Filkosky\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAD150.9DBA44B0]\r\nAndrew Filkosky\r\nAgency Open Records Officer - Department of Corrections\r\nGovernor's Office of General Counsel\r\n1920 Technology Parkway\r\nMechanicsburg, PA 17050\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION\r\nThe information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to whom it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

Part 304. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a)(2) further supports his appointment and states that the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cmay procure services of experts and consultants in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of section 3109 of title 5.\u201d His duties currently relate to improper payments and SSA\u2019s Death Master File (records maintained by SSA on deceased individuals). SSA is currently working with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to effectuate an interagency agreement for Employee 1 to be detailed temporarily to SBA. \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 3, a Schedule C Policy Advisor, detailed from the Department of Labor to SSA. The agreement finalizing his onboarding is dated February 22, 2025. His duties currently relate to improper payments and SSA\u2019s Death Master File (containing information about decedents from SSA records). \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 5, an engineer, detailed from the United States DOGE Service to SSA. The agreement finalizing his\r\nonboarding is an Interagency Agreement with U.S. Digital Service (now U.S. DOGE Service) covering Fiscal Year 2025, which was amended February 20, 2025 to recognize the change to U.S. DOGE Service; extend the duration to July 4, 2026; and modify and supplement certain terms in the original agreement. The agreement authorizes work to include, but does not limit work to, increasing efficiency and the modernization of SSA IT infrastructure and systems, detecting waste, fraud, and abuse. \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 2, Senior Advisor (Program Specialist AD-0301-00). He is in the process of being detailed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to SSA. The agency is waiting on final signature on the interagency detail agreement from NASA. His duties currently include serving as the DOGE lead at SSA\r\n\r\n\"On February 19, 2025, Employee 10, a software engineer, was detailed from the Office of the Administrator at the General Services Administration to SSA. His duties currently include supporting the leadership team with the assessment and enhancement of internal processes and operational procedures, specifically, focusing on identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement and ensuring that the administrative and programmatic functions align with the best practices for effectiveness and accountability. \r\n\r\n\"On February 26, 2025, Employee 8, an engineer, was detailed from Office of Personnel Management to SSA. His duties currently relate to improper payments and death data.\r\n\r\n\"On February 27, 2025, Employees 4, 6, and 9 were each appointed as an expert, special government employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 and 5 C.F.R. Part 304. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7904(a)(2) further supports their appointment and states that the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cmay procure services of experts and consultants in accordance with the provisions of section 3109 of title 5.\u201d All three of these individuals\u2019 duties currently relate to improper payments and death data.\r\n\r\n\"On March 5, 2025, the agency began onboarding Employee 7, as a detailee from Department of Labor (DOL) to SSA. The agency is waiting on final signatures on the interagency detail agreement from DOL. His duties currently relate to improper payments. \r\n\r\nI would like to request the following information:\r\n1. For the SGEs, I would like to receive whatever publicly shareable details can be made of their appointments, including if they signed SF-61s\r\n2. For the detailees, I would like to see their detailing agreements made with the other agency governing the scope of work and who they report to, etc.\r\n3. For the SGE potentially being detailed to the Small Business Administration, I would like to see that agreement\r\n4. I would like to request \"Signed Acknowledgements of SSA Information Security and Privacy Awareness Training, which covers requirements for compliance with information security and privacy policies of SSA.\" for both the SGEs and detailees.\r\n\r\nI expect the timespan for this inquiry to be in February 2025, but it does seem like there might be a pre-existing USDS detailing arrangemnt for Employee 5. I would prefer for documentation to include identities, since these individuals are government employees carrying out public services in an non-classified environment, but if those need to be redacted, I would still prefer to see the documentation of these detailing arrangements and SGE appointments where applicable. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",
