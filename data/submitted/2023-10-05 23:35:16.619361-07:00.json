All Office of Inspector General\u2019s audit reports of the Terrorist Screening Center from the year 2007 to the present.\r\n    2. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Terrorist Screening Center emails, letters, replies, objections other document filed or sent in reaction to the Office of Inspector General\u2019s audit reports since 2007.\r\n    3. Documents regarding administrative or judicial enforcement action to bring agency into compliance with regulations, the constitution and the law.\r\n    4. Complaints made to the Office of Inspector General since 2007 regarding the Terrorist Screening Center Operations. \r\n        \r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 9,000 subscribers and over 115,000 thousands views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O. Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX  77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",
