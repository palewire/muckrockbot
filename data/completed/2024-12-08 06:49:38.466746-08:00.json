        "communication": "Dera Ms. Feldman:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your October 24 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) request for records related to package theft trends across major U.S. metropolitan areas. Specially, your requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Statistics on reported package thefts from Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Denver and Portland between January 1, 2019, and the present.\r\n  2.  Policies and protocols for investigating package theft involving USPS deliveries.\r\n  3.  Communication or agreements between the USPS Postal Inspection Service and local police departments regarding theft investigations and prevention.\r\n  4.  Public outreach materials or initiatives addressing package theft prevention.\r\n\r\nThe OIG FOIA case number shown in the subject line above has been assigned to your request. Your request will be processed in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides agencies 20 working days from receipt to respond to requesters. While this office routinely meets this requirement, current workloads may require additional time to provide our final response.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA is about records we have in our possession. The FOIA provides only for disclosing federal agency records and does not require government agencies to answer questions, conduct unreasonably burdensome research, or create records. FOIA does not let you appeal any investigative decisions or ask us to research aside from searching for responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The FOIA provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, unless such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgment is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and employment/personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the law enforcement, crime prevention, and security arm of USPS, and is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Additional information regarding the USPIS FOIA program can be found at Terms of Service and Legal | USPIS<https://www.uspis.gov/terms-of-service#freedom-of-information-act>.\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG\u2019s mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \u201coversight authority\u201d for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control. Likewise, the OIG Deputy General Counsel has no authority to review FOIA determinations issued by the Postal Service or USPIS.\r\n\r\nBecause records related to external mail theft are maintained by the USPIS, we are forwarding a copy of your request to their FOIA office. They will issue a separate FOIA case number and respond to you directly. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them via email at foia@uspis.gov<mailto:foia@uspis.gov>, or in writing at:\r\n\nOffice of Counsel\r\nU.S. Postal Inspection Service FOIA/PA Unit\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Room 3301\r\nWashington, DC  20260\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

If you have any follow-up questions or would like to initiate an administrative appeal under MDAR 17-0002 Section 6, please contact us within 10 business days after downloading your records, after which this request will no longer be monitored for communications. You may also seek judicial review of our response to your request for a period of one year, beginning as of the date of this message, consistent with RCW 42.56.550. \r\nSincerely, \r\nTracie Cantrell",

Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or\r\n    transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer\r\n    slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or\r\n    describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to\r\n    confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If\r\n    previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release\r\n    consisting of those records while additional records are located and\r\n    processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Paul Galante\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation",

        "communication": "Good Morning Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Mir Qazi.  By letter dated August 27, 2019, you were informed that the estimated total cost for processing your request was approximately $745.00 for CD releases.  By email dated October 4, 2019, you indicated your willingness to pay $30.00 in FOIA processing fees.  In the meantime the FBI located approximately 33,072 pages potentially responsive to your request and the current estimated total cost for processing your request is approximately $985.00 for CD releases.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex x-large request processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete an x-large track request is at least 70 months.\r\n\r\nRIDS resumed full staffing on June 8, 2020.  Commensurate with the return of full staffing levels, RIDS will being increasing its FOIA processing production.  While RIDS will make its best efforts to meet increased production goals, this increased production rate may be negatively impacted by COVID-19 workplace disruptions.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\n",

        "communication": "Respectfully, your response appears evasive. The original request identified the records with \"reasonable specificity\" given the limited information and vague statements by VMI officials. The VMI superintendent stated during BOV meetings and his representatives stated to the media and in other public forums that VMI requires  the cadet on staff of The Cadet newspaper to have a \"faculty advisor\" as a condition of recognition and receipt of what the superintendent and his staff repeatedly referred to as a \"Permit\" to operate. I cannot identify the specific record(s) that the Superintendent and his staff refer to that gives them this legal authority since no VMI administrator including the Superintendent has identified them to date. In fact, request specifically asked for \"all records substantiating and supporting the legal authority the VMI Superintendent has to direct an independent student newspaper have a faculty advisor or withold \"privileges\" (however VMI defines them) from cadets unless they agree to a faculty advisor.\" This request asks specifically for those records. The FOIA requirement for specificity is only so a reasonable person given the information can reasonably be expected to locate responsive records. It is not a requirement that each record be accurately names and specifically identified. I also gave you the opportunity to clarify if this directive is in the form of a lawful order that the Superintendent is somehow empowered to issue and provide that order and the supporting legal foundation for it.\r\n\r\nMaj. Gen. Wins publically stated that VMI supports freedom of speech \"under certain restraints\". He did not specify what those \"constraints\" are. The request asked specifically for \"all records of what those restraints and constraints are with their legal foundation relative to the First Amendment.\" \r\n\r\nIn both cases if the public knew what authorities, restraints and constraints Maj. Gen. Wins was referring to for these actions then there would not be a need to request them under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nDuring the ExCom by Maj. Gen. Wins stated that and a large number of the Commandant\u2019s staff and \u201cthe entire Executive Staff\u201d except the athletic director were involved in developing the Permit and the MOU. The statement was made that it was \u201cfully coordinated\u201d and ready to go. \"We've had the Dean personally involved taking, uh, taking a stab at getting this thing.... I would say that, umm, uh, it, it's a, it's been amazing to me that over, uh, the period of all this time that it's taken, uh, that it has taken the, the direct involvement of the Superintendent and/or the direct involvement of, uh, the Dean, uh, to get this done.\" Also, \" \"through the efforts of, uh, pretty much the entire executive staff, with the exception of the athletic director, we've been working on the development of a permit and an MOU for the eight or nine members of The Cadet staff. ... I think one of the things that, through this process, particularly with MY direct involvement we went back based on the direction I gave and, and we're gonna apply the permit just like we've applied every other permit.\" The request is specific as to all records related to these interactions. The FOIA requirement for specificity is only so a reasonable person given the information can reasonably be expected to locate responsive records. It is not a requirement that each record be accurately names and specifically identified.\r\n\r\nFinally, the request asks for \"all correspondence and other records of any kind sent to and/or received by VMI Board of Visitors President John Adams, former VMI BOV President Thomas Watjen, and/or VMI Supeintendent Cedric Wins sent to or from any person or organization, VMI and/or VMI Alumni Association staff, contractor and/or employees on the subject of The Cadet newspaper as well as any records, correspondence, records, etc. sent to or received from the VMI Alumni Agencies as well as internal VMI records regarding The Cadet newspaper for the period October 4, 2024 to the date the agency begins identifying records to fill my request.\" You filled a previous request for these same records but stated that records I requested and know to exist were not within the date range of my original request and so I needed to resubmit with a broader date range. You filled that request and you should be able to fill this one. To further clarify and eliminate what appears to be your confusion in this, the scope of this request is from the date of the last document provided in my previous request to the date of this reply to your comments. Whereas I cannot reasonably know who exactly sent correspondence to the BOV and exactly what institute officials were involved it is unreasonable to require I identify specific records and persons. The FOIA requirement for specificity is only so a reasonable person given the information can reasonably be expected to locate responsive records. It is not a requirement that each record be accurately names and specifically identified.\r\n\r\nI trust this clarifies the issue and my request will be filled expeditiously.\r\n",

Your request mentioned: To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll documents relating to the \"employee scheduling\" or \"call-in pay\" rule (LAB-47-17-00011) developed under Commissioner Roberta Reardon at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo. Responsive documents include, but are not limited to, drafts and revisions of the proposed rule, testimony and recordings from public hearings, analyses, summaries, reports, memoranda, letters, emails and attachments prepared, issued, or received by the Commissioner, members of the Wage Board, or Department of Labor staff during the period 7/1/2017\u20136/30/2019. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made for non-commercial research purposes. The requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer to receive the responsive records in an electronic format through the online portal or by email attachment. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel \r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow \r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnew-york-state-department-labor-4385%252Femployee-scheduling-rule-making-records-nys-dol-154560%252F%253Femail%253Dfoil%252540labor.ny.gov&url_auth_token=AAAXX-hx3MeDsgGxu1jfBSeuOqw%3A1r3RRZ%3ATKpQwCRANVv0eqG4yoecPfGKsFRjWWYvI26iy297GaY We have reviewed the records that were responsive to your request and applied redactions in accordance with the Public Officers Law. The basis of our conclusion that certain information is exempt from disclosure, and therefore has been redacted, is explained further below. Please be advised that access is denied to information which \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 87(2)(b), 89(2)(b), and 96(1). Also, access is denied to records that are inter or intra-agency materials which are not statistical or factual tabulations or data, instructions to staff that affect the public, final agency policy or determinations, or external audits pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g). Additionally, access is denied to information which, if disclosed , would jeopardize the capacity of an agency or an entity that has shared information with an agency to guarantee the security of its information technology assets, such assets encompassing both electronic information systems and infrastructures pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (i).
