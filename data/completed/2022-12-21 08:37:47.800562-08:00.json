        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, that was written by or sent to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present date that contains the following words or phrases:\r\n\u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cballot(s)\u201d, \u201celection fraud\u201d, and \u201cballot fraud\u201d\r\n2. All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, to and from the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present that has a subject matter relating to \u201coperational changes\u201d\r\n3. All memos and correspondence written to or from the office of the Inspector General from 5/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201corganizational changes\u201d, and \u201c2020 election\u201d\r\n4. All email correspondence between high-ranking officials at USPS from 7/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201cchanges\u201d, \u201cethics\u201d, \u201ccomplaints\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, and \u201corganizational changes\u201d\r\n5. All data sheets from 5/1/2020 that describe organizational changes in the operation of the United States Postal Service\r\n6. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to the present \r\n7. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020\r\nFee Waiver:\r\nI hereby request that all fees be waived as this is a matter of public interest.\r\n1. The records that are being requested concerns \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d. This is since the Postmaster General acts as the decision making body that is in charge of determining whether changes are to be made inside the United States Postal Service. Also, the OIG acts as a watchdog over USPS and thus is in and of itself participating in \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d.\r\n2. The documents requested will contribute to the understanding of the stated \u201coperation or activities of the government\u201d. The documents requested will allow for insight into the decision for the USPS to be processing mail more slowly and alerting that mail-in ballots might not get to voters on time. There have been calls made by members of Congress to investigate said activities as well. This significance of said records have been demonstrated through various news outlets as well as a letter by a senator.\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-reviewing-dejoy/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-letter-usps-practices/index.html\r\n3. The records requested directly impacts millions of Americans that will be voting by mail in the upcoming election. This is since these records will provide insight into how mail-in voting will operate through the United States Postal Service. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many Americans will decide to vote by mail instead of voting in person. In a survey conducted in May 2020, 64% of Americans were in favor of voting by mail (https://news.gallup.com/poll/310586/americans-favor-voting-mail-option-november.aspx). These records will allow the public to determine whether or not it will be the best option to vote by mail. This is since these records can show or not show whether or not the systematic changes in the United States Postal Service will have a direct impact on whether a voter decides to vote by mail or not. This will also allow for due diligence to be made by states in order to make sure that every vote is counted in the appropriate manner. The documents will be available publicly and will be disseminated across news outlets in order to inform the public. \r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-mail-voting-fraud.html\r\n4. The documents requested will allow for a clear understanding of \u201cthe operations and activities of government\u201d. Presently, the public doesn\u2019t have information to evaluate as to whether the changes made in USPS will impact how mail-in voting will occur in the upcoming election. This is since there is no information that is readily available as it is breaking news and has recently been covered by news outlets. Currently, the Speaker of the House is requesting a hearing where the present Postmaster General is requested to appear and testify (https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html). These documents will be able to direct the course of the congressional hearing as it will give insight into the changes in operation at the United States Postal Service.\r\nExpedited Processing\r\n1. I hereby request expedited processing for this request as well. I am not a member of the news media however I am submitting this request through a platform (Muckrock.com), whose primary purpose is to disseminate information. As such, the mode of disseminating information is valid as meeting the first prong for being \u201cprimarily engaged in disseminating information\u201d.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public regarding the requested documents. The current subject matter is ongoing as shown through various news outlets covering the story. This is an urgent matter to all Americans as it directly relates to the processing of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election.\r\nList:\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-demand-postmaster-general-usps-chairman-testify-urgently-on-sabotage-of-postal-service.amp\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/trump-administration-postal-service-elections/index.html\r\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/taylor-swift-slams-trumps-calculated-dismantling-usps-rcna83\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/08/15/902811968/trump-offers-conflicting-statements-on-mail-in-voting-usps-funding\r\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/13/us-postal-service-whats-going-post-office-what-we-know/3360565001/\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/usps-vote-mail.html\r\n2. This is currently a breaking news story whose value would be diminished without these records. Also, there is currently a pending request to have the Postmaster General appear in Congress in order to testify. The previous news releases demonstrates the urgency in obtaining these records.\r\n3. The requested records clearly concerns federal government activity. This is since the records will explain the process taken that has caused USPS to have organizational changes. Also, it will determine whether there was any wrongdoing based on possible records that will show communications with specific words that will be instrumental in evaluating the decisions made by the Postmaster General.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarlos Gamez\n\n",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Gamez:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your August 17 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for records related to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to Postmaster General (PMG) Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"mail in ballots\", \"2020 election\", \"ballot(s)\", \"election fraud\", \"ballot fraud\".\r\n  2.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to PMG Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present having a subject matter relating to \"operational changes\".\r\n  3.  Memos or correspondence written to or from the OIG from 5/1/2020 to present containing \"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\".\r\n  4.  Email correspondence between high-ranking officials at the U.S. Postal Service from 7/1/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"Louis DeJoy\", \"changes\", \"ethics\", \"complaints\", \"2020 election\", \"mail in ballots\", and \"organizational changes\".\r\n  5.  All data sheets from 5/1/2020 describing organizational changes in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n  6.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n  7.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgement is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office, along with the St Louis Requester Service Center, is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Information on the USPIS is available on the Internet at: https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \"oversight authority\" for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause records related to items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 would be potentially maintained by the Postal Service, we have referred your request to their FOIA office for processing and direct response to you. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them online at https://pfoiapal.usps.com/, via email at foia12@usps.gov<mailto:foia12@usps.gov>, via phone at (202) 268-2608, via fax at (202) 268-5353, or in writing at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Service Records Office\r\n\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P830\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20260-4541\r\n\r\nRegarding item #3, in order for us to process this portion of your request, under C.F.R. Title 39 \u00a7 265.3(c) requires requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. If seeking information about a company, requesters should provide the exact name and address of the company (many companies use similar names). Therefore, we will need you to please provide a listing of the names of any OIG employees you wish us to search against. Limiting the number of names you provide will substantially increase the time it takes to locate and process any responsive records.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive the listing of OIG employee names, in order to conduct an adequate search for these records, we would need to do a data transfer of the entire mailbox of each individual you choose to name (to include inbox, sent items, and deleted items) and place these data files in a secure location. At this point, FOIA staff will be able to conduct key word search of \"\"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\", and/or any other search term you may suggest.  We would then need to review each data file for responsiveness before conducting a line-by-line examination to determine what information may be released in accordance with FOIA regulations. We understand this portion of your request to be for memos or correspondence related to \"organizational changes\" recently in the news at the Postal Service, not the OIG. Be advised e-mails are not considered an established system of records under the Privacy Act and would be considered for release only under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive a listing of named OIG employee profiles by COB September 15, we will presume you are no longer interested in pursuing this request and will close your file, but you may file again later. You may return the completed form via e-mail at foia@uspsoig.gov<mailto:foia@uspsoig.gov> or U.S. Mail at 1735 N. Lynn Street, Arlington, VA 22209.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

The FOIA allows agencies twenty (20) working days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) to process requests.  In unusual circumstances, agencies may qualify for further extensions, and may request a modified FOIA request and/or time frame for response.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).\r\n\r\n\u201cUnusual circumstances\u201d apply to the processing of a request if one or more of the following apply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another department or agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii).\r\n\r\nThis letter serves as timely notice that unusual circumstances apply to your request as a result of item outlined above. As such, we are extending the response period until December 2, 2022, instead of September 30, 2022, as stated in my previous correspondence.  You will be contacted on or immediately after that date.\r\n\r\nAgain, please accept my apologies for the delay response.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNancy P. Chavannes\r\nNancy P.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.

In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

        "communication": "Good Morning:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District received your public records request yesterday. Your e-mail listed the date of November 18, 2022 as the original date you sent it.  I did not recall receiving your request.  In researching your request, I have learned that the District actually received it on December 1st.  The District apologizes for the late response to your request.\r\n\r\nYou have requested the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022.\r\n\r\n2. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2021.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2021.\r\n\r\n3. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2020.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\nThe District has already requested the responsive records from the District\u2019s IT Department.  The District will be working with the IT Department to begin providing responsive records as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nYour request seeks, \u201c\u2026any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nI understand \u201cprovided by your agency\u2026to employees, contractors\u201d to mean hotspots and other related access points provided to individuals away from the District\u2019s property, schools, offices, worksites, etc. This would excluded those hotspots installed in the District\u2019s brick buildings and portable classrooms and officers that are unable to access the District\u2019s Wi-Fi. Please let me know if I am misunderstanding your request.\r\n\r\nI estimate the District will have the first installment of responsive records to you by Wednesday, January 4, 2023. This estimate is based on the number of public records requests the District is currently answering, the fact that it is winter break and all of the schools and many of the departments are enjoying vacation time, that there are two legal holidays in the next two weeks, and that the District\u2019s Records Specialist will be starting a planned leave in the New Year. If available before January 4th, I will provide them to you.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand you do not wish to receive responsive records through a third party \u201cportal\u201d, the District uses GovQA to accept, track and answer all public records requests.  Therefore the District will be using it to track your request. So while the District\u2019s correspondence and responsive records will be sent to you through this e-mail address, you will also be receiving the same from GovQA.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the late response to your December 1, 2022 request.

Your e-mail listed the date of November 18, 2022 as the original date you sent it.\u00a0 I did not recall receiving your request.\u00a0 In researching your request, I have learned that the District actually received it on December 1 st.\u00a0 The District apologizes for the late response to your request. \nYou have requested the following records: 1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022. These records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. Also include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022. 2. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2021. These records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. Also include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2021. 3. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2020. These records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. Also include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020. The District has already requested the responsive records from the District\u2019s IT Department.\u00a0 The District will be working with the IT Department to begin providing responsive records as soon as possible. \nYour request seeks, \u201c\u2026 any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public\u2026\u201d \nI understand \u201cprovided by your agency\u2026to employees, contractors\u201d to mean hotspots and other related access points provided to individuals away from the District\u2019s property, schools, offices, worksites, etc. This would excluded those hotspots installed in the District\u2019s brick buildings and portable classrooms and officers that are unable to access the District\u2019s Wi-Fi. Please let me know if I am misunderstanding your request. \nI estimate the District will have the first installment of responsive records to you by Wednesday, January 4, 2023. This estimate is based on the number of public records requests the District is currently answering, the fact that it is winter break and all of the schools and many of the departments are enjoying vacation time, that there are two legal holidays in the next two weeks, and that the District\u2019s Records Specialist will be starting a planned leave in the New Year. If available before January 4 th, I will provide them to you. \nWhile I understand you do not wish to receive responsive records through a third party \u201cportal\u201d, the District uses GovQA to accept, track and answer all public records requests.\u00a0 Therefore the District will be using it to track your request. So while the District\u2019s correspondence and responsive records will be sent to you through this e-mail address, you will also be receiving the same from GovQA. \nThe District apologizes for the late response to your December 1, 2022 request. The District received several records requests through Muckrock on and around that date. Your request must have been mixed with the other requests. Beginning\u00a0December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.\u00a0 Please see our policy and\u00a0procedures\u00a0for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578\u00a0 and \u00a0https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577 If you have any questions or if i have misunderstood your request in any way, please let me know by responding to this email.

A log of all emails to/from Derrick Little, most recently a specialist in the Office of Student Health and Wellness, from October 24, 2021 to November 4, 2021. Please search all of his CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, and subject line. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA office submitted an electronic discovery request and concluded that it is unduly burdensome as it requires the search and/or collection of broad categories of records. The search parameters you provided yielded 713 e-mail messages. In order to comply with this request, each and every of the 713 e-mail message subject lines and \u201cto,\u201d \u201cfrom,\u201d \u201ccc,\u201d and \u201cbcc\u2019s,\u201d would have to be downloaded and reviewed to determine if content is exempt from release under FOIA. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest in this information. This\u00a0is\u00a0NOT\u00a0an automatic\u00a0denial\u00a0of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3 (g), we are asking that you narrow your request to more manageable proportions by replying to this email. If you do not narrow your request within 5 business days, this request will be closed. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. 2.

A log of all emails to/from Sarah Briggs, most recently the director of the Office of Access and Enrollment, from August 1, 2022 to current. Please search all of her CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, and subject line. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA office submitted an electronic discovery request and concluded that it is unduly burdensome as it requires the search and/or collection of broad categories of records. The search parameters you provided yielded 7,637 e-mail messages. In order to comply with this request, each and every of the 7,637 e-mail message subject lines and \u201cto,\u201d \u201cfrom,\u201d \u201ccc,\u201d and \u201cbcc\u2019s,\u201d would have to be downloaded and reviewed to determine if content is exempt from release under FOIA. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest in this information. This\u00a0is\u00a0NOT\u00a0an automatic\u00a0denial\u00a0of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3 (g), we are asking that you narrow your request to more manageable proportions by replying to this email. If you do not narrow your request within 5 business days, this request will be closed. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

For instance, if Shotspotter was implemented in the city on January 1, 2008, I would like all Shotspotter data from this date to December 31st, 2020. The list/database should include, where possible, the date, time, location (address or latitude+longitude coordinates), single or multiple shot distinction, whether the shots were confirmed, police district located, and associated case number for each alert.\r\n2) Any document that provides information on the procedure for how  the police department should respond to Shotspotter alerts. In particular, I am looking for a document that describes how the police will react to a Shotspotter alert. For instance, if an alert is created, are police dispatched?\r\n3) Shotspotter rollout dates. If the police department rolled out the Shotspotter data by police district, please include the implementation dates attached to each police district.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

A log of all emails to/from Devon LaRosa, most recently Network Chief for Network 16, from August 1, 2022 to current. Please search all of his CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, and subject line. This log is limited to emails containing keywords \"Spry\" and/or \"Community Links\". \r\n2. A log of all emails to/from Antonio Acevedo, most recently a Network Chief for Network 7 , from August 1, 2022 to current. Please search all of his CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, and subject line. This log is limited to emails containing keywords \"Spry\" and/or \"Community Links\". RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA office submitted an electronic discovery request and concluded that it is unduly burdensome as it requires the search and/or collection of broad categories of records. The search parameters you provided yielded 1,546 e-mail messages. In order to comply with this request, each and every of the 1,546 e-mail message subject lines and \u201cto,\u201d \u201cfrom,\u201d \u201ccc,\u201d and \u201cbcc\u2019s,\u201d would have to be downloaded and reviewed to determine if content is exempt from release under FOIA. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest in this information. This\u00a0is\u00a0NOT\u00a0an automatic\u00a0denial\u00a0of your request.

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Further, the District has been working to answer your original request since November 2021.  On November 4, 2021 the Richland School District received your first records request. Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

In your request you sought:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\nThe District uses GovQA to accept, track and answer all public records requests. In your original request you stated that you decline the use of GovQA.  Therefore the District has been and will continue to use its own e-mail system to communicate with you and to provide you with responsive records. One of the limitations to the District\u2019s use of its own e-mail system is the size of the file it can send. Therefore the District must break up the responsive records into smaller files so that they can be e-mailed to you.\r\n\r\nIncluded with this are responsive records.  The District will continue to provide you with installments of the responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

In order to inspect or copy a public record, the specific record must be identified by the person requesting the document.  Courts in addressing this issue have held that \"agencies are required to disclose only 'identifiable' governmental records not otherwise exempt.  Wholesale requests for general information to be analyzed, collected and compiled by the responding government entity are not encompassed therein.\"  Hodai v. City of Tucson, C20141225 (Ariz. Super. Ct. 2014) citing mag Entertainment LLC v. Div. of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067, 1076 (N.J. Sup. Ct. App. Div. 2005).  A government agency is not required to respond to an overbroad request that does not request specific records.  Id. at 1074, citing Capitol Info. Assoc. v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985).  The request is a broad demand, not a request for a specific record.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to work with you, the University seeks clarification of your request.   Please provide the name in which complaints against \"those working towards University recognition\" would be made; without that information, the University is unable to identify records that may be responsive to that part of your request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please identify the \"other manner\" from which you are seeking complaints.  Please note that UNR Police Services does not handle administrative complaints or complaints of policy violations.\r\n\r\nDue to the significant length of time (6 years) for which you are requesting records and due to the need to gather, review, and possibly redact confidential information from otherwise responsive records, the University will need additional time to respond to your request.  The University is interested in working with you to narrow your request as stated above.  In the absence of identifying a narrower request, the University will need additional time, up to and including December 12, 2022, to respond to your request.\r\n\r\nThe University will await direction and/or contact from you regarding working with the University to narrow the request.    Given the timing information above, please provide the clarification requested and confirm that you want the University to proceed with the request, that you want to narrow the request, or that you  would like to discuss the request and ways to narrow it with the University.\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[University of Nevada, Reno logo]<http://www.unr.edu/>\r\n\r\nLewis Beck\r\nOperations Coordinator,\r\nAdministration and Finance\r\nMail stop: 0003\r\n\r\nVPAF Office: (775)784-4031<tel:(775)784-4031>\r\nWork Phone: (775)682-9269\r\nlewisbeck@unr.edu<mailto:lewisbeck@unr.edu>",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll documents, emails and memorandum regarding the September 2005 decision to alert the satirical The Onion newspaper about the misuse of the Presidential Seal. \r\n\r\nAccording to an October 2005 article, associate counsel to the President Grant M. Dixon sent to a letter to The Onion on September 28th of 2005. This article reportedly cited 18 U.S. Code 713 which sets legal guidelines for the use of the likeness of the Presidential Seal.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to an article that discusses Grant M. Dixon\u2019s letter:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/24/business/protecting-the-presidential-seal-no-joke.html\r\n\r\nFor this request please search for:\r\n\r\nThe final and complete letter sent by Grant M. Dixon on September 28th 2005.\r\n\r\nAll drafts and revisions made in the crafting of this letter.\r\n\r\nAll internal deliberations into why The Onion (in particular) was in violation of 18 U.S. Code 713. Please include emails, PowerPoints, legal briefs or other documents related to The Onion, the image of the Presidential Seal, and 18 U.S. Code 713.\r\n\r\nThe reply sent from The Onion to Grant M. Dixon in regards to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Producing over 5,500+ complaints would put an undue burden on the agency.  You can also reduce the date range of the complaints you are requesting and reduce the scope of your request (by reducing some of the companies you are seeking complaints about).\r\n\r\nComplaints are categorized by various issues (i.e. billing, availability, equipment, unwanted calls, indecency, interference, closed captioning, etc.).    Maybe you can also further reduce the scope of your request by narrowing it to one of the various issues.\r\n\r\nPlease give me a call on 202 418 2869 if you would like to discuss your request for clarification via telephone.  If we don't hear back from you by December 5, 2022, we will assume you are no longer interested in pursuing your FOIA request, therefore, it will be closed.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The consultant is using the ALPR data to create utilization and turnover reports in parking lots and garages for the Parking Program. The city does not share its data with any other agency or organization.\r\n\r\n* A2 - We receive our ALPR data from Motorola Solutions via their Vigilant ALPR system.\r\n\r\n* A3 - None. ALPR is currently used for parking enforcement purposes only.\r\n\r\n* A4 - None.\r\n\r\n* B1 - 77,748\r\n\r\n* B2 - 564\r\n\r\n* B3 - 590,280\r\n\r\n* B4 - 2,186\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a side note, we are not obligated to provide answers to questions, but did so out of courtesy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe trust this satisfies your request, and we will consider the request closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nSamantha Pascoe\r\n\r\nDeputy City Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Napa.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

        "communication": "Thank you for the response, however I urge you to either conduct another search for records or escalate this matter to a higher authority within the City of Napa.  \r\n\r\nNapa Police Department policy 429 clearly states that NPD uses ALPR for purposes outside the scope of parking enforcement. Here's NPD's policy manual: https://www.cityofnapa.org/DocumentCenter/View/9641/Napa-Police-Department-Manual-PDF?bidId=\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have received multiple \"Data Sharing Reports\" from other agencies in California that indicate that Napa Police Department is both receiving and sharing ALPR data with other agencies.  Here is one example from two days ago:  https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2022/11/09/22-211_Response.pdf\r\n\r\nI can provide more examples should you require. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, there were no question marks  in my request. You are however obligated to \"assist the member of the public to identify records and information that are responsive to the request or to the purpose of the request\" and to \"provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought.\"  I provided a list of the information I sought and the purpose of seeking that information, as well as what I felt would be the least labor-intensive and most focused way to provide the data. Hundreds of agencies in California and nationwide have responded with little trouble. As noted in my original request, should you disagree, there are other records mandated under state law and NPD policy that you can provide. For example, under NPD police 429.7, ALPR data sharing requires any agency seeking data to submit that request in writing and that the approved request be retained on file by NPD. A list would have sufficed, but you also could have provided each one of these requests. \r\n\r\nI urge to either reopen this request or refer this matter to a higher administrative level at Napa. ",

Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",
