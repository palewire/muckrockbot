        "communication": "Dear Department of Youth Services Records Access Officer: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n  1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DYS custody (including \r\n  either detained or committed youth) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, \r\n  hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate \r\n  the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, \r\n  ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n \r\n  2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\r\n    a. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance) as to how your \r\n    agency operates or utilizes GPS monitoring,\r\n    b. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\r\n    c. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\r\n   d. Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants on ELMO,\r\n   e. The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\r\n   f. Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between the Department of Youth Services and the \r\n   Massachusetts Probation Service or its ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DYS custody on expedited release under \r\n   community supervision or \r\n \r\n       3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the Department of Youth Services\u2019s custody, on expedited release under community supervision or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\r\n            l. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\r\n           m. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO \r\n           n. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, expedited release under community supervision etc.)\r\n           o. Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\r\n           p. County and Zip Code of individual\r\n           q. Age of individual\r\n           r. Gender of individual \r\n           s. Race of individual\r\n           t. Ethnicity of individual \r\n           u. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\r\n           v. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the \r\n            violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable. \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Youth Services. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nErin Stewart\r\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

        "communication": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your help with this request! I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the records you sent over only have medical fees, but not room and board costs charged to those incarcerated in your facilities. I have found statutory evidence that suggests the department is authorized to collect room and board fees. Below for your reference is the statute:\r\n\r\nSec. 33.30.201.   Compensation of prison inmates; deductions; disbursement; liens. \r\n (a) Each prisoner who is productively employed, as defined in AS 33.30.191(g)(1) or (3) \u2014 (5), may receive for that work compensation at a rate determined by the commissioner under this section if the money is available from legislative appropriations. Compensation established by the commissioner under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065; however, if required to comply with a federal statute or regulation, a higher compensation may be established by the commissioner.\r\n(b) If compensation established under (a) of this section is 50 percent or more of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065, the commissioner may deduct the cost of confinement of the prisoner up to the statewide average cost of confinement before disbursements are made under (c) of this section.\r\n(c) The commissioner shall disburse compensation received under (a) of this section, after any deduction required by (b) of this section, in the following order of priority:\r\n     (1) for support of the prisoner's dependents, if any;\r\n     (5) for the payment of fees for the prisoner's utilities services under AS 33.30.017;\r\n\r\nI would like to request all reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding the room and board fees assessed to those incarcerated in Alaska DOC facilities or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding room and board costs, including the number of individuals charged and the total amount of room and board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMercy Loyo",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The records you seek are\r\nnot readily available and would be unduly burdensome to gather, compile,\r\nredact, and production.  Please narrow your request in both time and scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nA public entity need not produce records that are not readily available and\r\nwould require research, compilation, and redaction to produce. *See* NRS\r\n239.010 (NPRA applies to \u201cpublic books and public records\u201d); NRS 239.0107\r\n(NPRA applies to a \u201cpublic book or record\u201d); NAC 239.867 (agency is not\r\nrequired to create a public record that does not exist); *Public Employees\u2019\r\nRetirement System of Nevada v.

On 8/29/2022, we advised you that your request expedited processing was denied, and your request was assigned to the appropriate Justice Management Division (JMD) staff office for processing.  For your information, the JMD and the Department of Justice (Department) assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  We can report that your FOIA request was assigned to the JMD Human Resources Staff (HR) office for action and response. As mentioned above, each request is handled on a \u201cfirst in - first out\u201d basis in relation to other requests in that same track.  Currently, that office is processing 23 other Complex FOIAs that are ahead of you in their queue. We have contacted HR to see if they can provide us with any additional information to pass onto you.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-514-3101 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Anything below will not be viewable to staff. --- \r\n\r\n03/30/2023 \r\nRose Terse, \r\nAs per our last message, and because we have not received further information from you by the deadline we provided, we are closing your request as complete. If you do have further questions, please reach out to Records directly at 425-452-6917, or you can submit a new request via our records portal. This concludes our search of records in the custody of the Bellevue Police Department. Your request is now closed; we have nothing additionally responsive to this request. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. \r\nPer the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. \r\nIf you believe the information furnished has been incorrectly redacted or is incomplete, you may file a written appeal. The appeal must include your name and address, a copy of the redacted document and a copy of this letter together with a brief statement identifying the basis of the appeal. Please mail your appeal to: \r\nBellevue Police Department \r\nAttn: Records Supervisor \r\nP.O. Box 90012 \r\nBellevue, WA\u00a0 98009-9012 \r\nThank you, \r\nJessica Abbott \r\nBellevue Police Department RPC 4.4 Inadvertent Disclosure Notification: CR 26 (b) (6) Claw Back Provision *** Please read this notice carefully *** \r\nDear legal practitioner: Please take notice that we take reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of privileged or confidential materials, including those protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine, when responding to request for records.\u00a0 These precautions include, but are not limited to, carefully locating and assembling responsive records, performing an intra-departmental review of the records for purposes of determining whether they contain any privileged or confidential materials, forwarding the records to the County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for independent legal review, meeting and conferring with the Prosecuting Attorney's Office to compare and reconcile any conflicting results of our separate independent reviews and, if necessary, creating a withholding log.\u00a0 Despite our having taken these precautions, occasionally a mistake is made and privileged or confidential documents are inadvertently produced.\u00a0 To that end, we wanted to notify you that there is a possibility that the records being produced may contain privileged or confidential materials.\u00a0 The inadvertent or unintentional production of privileged or confidential documents, without a privileged or confidentiality designation should not be considered a waiver in whole or in part of any claim of privileged or confidential treatment, and any document that initially is produced without bearing a privileged or confidentiality designation may later be so designated.\u00a0 In the event that you believe you have received privileged or confidential materials, we would ask that you promptly notify us of this fact and take action as necessary to comply with the obligations set forth in Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4 and/or Civil Rule 26 (b)(6).",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nWe have released today the police report associated with this incident. Kindly note that documents have been redacted, pursuant to the Access to Public Records Act, R.I.G.L. \u00a7 38-2-2(4)(D)(c), to prevent the disclosure of information which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and R.I.G.L. \u00a7\u00a7 11-49.3-2(b) and 38-2-2(4)(S) because they are \"records, reports, opinions, information, and statements required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulation or state law, or rule of court.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is footage from one or more body-worn cameras associated with this incident; it constitutes the remaining document responsive to your request, as the City does not have \"dash-cams.\" The Public Records Unit has conducted an initial review of the responsive documents and has determined that it will take 9 hours of search, retrieval, review and redaction to respond to your request. Under the Access to Public Records Act, the City may charge $15 per hour for search, retrieval, review, and redaction, with the first hour free. See R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-4(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you wish to obtain this video, you will be charged $120 for this request. Please note that this is just an estimate and you will be charged based upon actual time and costs. Please further note that nothing in this message is a determination that the footage is a public record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly note that the time to respond to your request is tolled pending receipt of your authorization and prepayment in the amount set forth in the estimate. Checks made payable to the City of Providence may be sent to: Public Records Unit, 444 Westminster Street, Suite 220, Providence, RI 02903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Providence.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

See Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a). The Executive Chamber employs nearly 300 individuals and does not maintain records in a manner that allows all records sent and received by all employees on a given day to be readily accessed, segregated, and reviewed.\u00a0 The broad scope of your request does not sufficiently describe the records you seek to enable the Executive Chamber to conduct a search and locate responsive records. \nPlease respond to this letter by providing a list of Executive Chamber custodians to enable the Executive Chamber to conduct a search and locate responsive records. If you do not respond to our letter within 7 days with additional information permitting us to conduct a search, we will consider your request denied and the matter closed. Pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a), you have thirty (30) days to take a written appeal of this determination.\u00a0 You may appeal by writing:\u00a0 FOIL Appeals Officer, Executive Chamber, State Capitol, Albany, New York, 12224.

Dear Sam Mellins, This letter responds to your request dated October 17, 2022, which pursuant to FOIL, requested: Emails between Kathryn Garcia and email addresses containing the following domain names: \nrebny.com \nrelated.com \nvno.com \nhess.com \nmeqs.com \ncoinmint.one \nrxr.com \ntishmanspeyer.com \nnirvana.money \nwebsterbank.com \ndouglasdev.com \ngranitenet.com \nunfinished.com \nmccourt.com \nrich.com \nsomersetpartnersllc.com \ngtlaw.com Please be advised that your request is not \u201creasonably described,\u201d as required by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3).\u00a0 Whether a request is reasonably described may be dependent upon the nature of an agency\u2019s filing or record keeping system and agency employees are not required to engage in herculean or unreasonable efforts to locate records (see Konigsberg v. Coughlin, 68 N.Y.2d 245 (N.Y. 1986) and the NYS Committee on Open Government\u2019s FOIL Advisory Opinions 18949 and 18863). \n\nYour request seeks records during an unknown time period, as such, it does not \u201creasonably describe\u201d the records requested.\u00a0 See Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a).\u00a0 The Committee on Open Government has explained that \u201ca request for \u2018all\u2019 records, without limitation, that include a certain name, for example, might not be found to reasonably describe the records.\u201d (COOG AO-18949 (Aug. 20, 2012)).\u00a0 As you have been advised on previous FOIL requests for the same records, see below, this Office requires a timeframe to conduct a records search.\u00a0 The broad scope of your request does not sufficiently identify the types of records sought to enable the Executive Chamber to facilitate a search and locate responsive records,and is therefore denied. Furthermore, this FOIL request is a near duplicate to a FOIL request you submitted to this Office on June 3, 2022, assigned FOIL #4172.\u00a0 That request initially sought the same records without a timeframe.\u00a0 On June 6, 2022, this Office asked you to supply a timeframe for the responsive records, warning you that the request as originally written was not reasonably described.\u00a0 On June 7, 2022, you supplied a timeframe, and this Office was then able to process your request.\u00a0 This Office supplied you with records responsive to FOIL #4172 on January 30, 2023.\u00a0 Please note that FOIL does not require an agency to provide duplicates of documents previously provided to you ( Franklin v Keller, 254 AD2d 83; Matter of Huston v Turkel, 236 AD2d 283; Matter of Moore v Santucci, 151 AD2d 677; Matter of Swinton v Records Access Officers for the New York City Police Department, 198 AD2d 165).\u00a0 As such, to the extent this request seeks the same records provided to you under FOIL #4172, it is denied. \n\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a), you have thirty (30) days to take a written appeal of this determination.\u00a0 You may make an appeal by writing:\u00a0 FOIL Appeals Officer, Executive Chamber, State Capitol, Albany, New York, 12224.

Electronic records must not be printed and scanned as that does not constitute a \"copy\" (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098). You must justify every withholding of any information in writing.  You must provide footnotes or other clear references to justify each and every redaction (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098).  If you do not provide correct copies of electronic records or do not justify by footnote or other clear reference each and every redaction, we will ask SOTF to file Official Misconduct charges against Director Henderson before the Ethics Commission, as we did against Chief Scott in SOTF 19112, pursuant to SFAC 67.34.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a publicly- viewable mailbox. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

We have successfully received your public records request and will respond as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRequests for public records are processed in the order that they are received and can take up to 30 business days to be fulfilled and/or invoiced. Processing time may be longer due to the nature and extent of the request. Furthermore, the processing time may be affected by other business processes that have statutory and/or court ordered time limits for completion and, therefore, will take priority over a public records request.\r\n\r\nShould your request require extensive clerical or supervisory costs, you will be provided an invoice for the estimated costs associated with your request; this estimate must be paid prior to the start of any records production.\r\n\r\nThe result for some requests requiring extensive clerical or supervisory labor may be negative and BCSO may not have records responsive to the public records request. Deposits will not be returned for labor expended researching requests even if the search produces no responsive records.\r\n\r\nPublic records requests will be closed if the requesting party fails to pay the estimated or final invoice, or fails to respond to clarification inquiries pertaining to a public records request thirty (30) days following the issuance of the invoice or clarification inquiry. If you have previously received an estimated or final invoice and you have not paid the costs associated with that request, BCSO will not provide records for subsequent requests until such time as the past due amounts have been paid. After payment is received, the outstanding request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request.

Code Ann. \u00a725-61-3(f) and Miss. Code Ann. \u00a725-61-12(2): \u201cInvestigative reports\u201d\r\n  *   Miss. Code Ann. \u00a725-61-12(3): personal information of victims\r\n\r\nPlease see the below statute authorizing the MBI to investigation all OIS cases in the State of MS:\r\n\u00a7 45-1-6. Special contract agents authorized; powers; qualifications; form of contract; agents not considered employees of Mississippi Bureau of Investigation; investigation of certain incidents of officer-involved shootings.\r\n\r\n  1.  The Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is authorized to retain on a contractual basis such persons as he shall deem necessary to detect and apprehend violators of the criminal statutes of this state.\r\n  2.  Those persons contracting with the Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation pursuant to subsection (1) shall be known and hereinafter referred to as \u201cspecial contract agents.\u201d\r\n  3.  The investigative services provided for in this section shall be designed to support law enforcement efforts of state agencies and to support local law enforcement efforts.\r\n  4.  Special contract investigators shall have all powers necessary and incidental to the fulfillment of their contractual obligations, including the power of arrest when authorized by the Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.\r\n  5.  No person shall be a special contract investigator unless he is at least twenty-one (21) years of age.\r\n  6.  The Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation shall conduct a background investigation of all potential special contract investigators. All contract agents must meet the minimum standard requirements established by the Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training.\r\n  7.  Any contract pursuant to subsection (1) shall be:\r\n     *   Reduced to writing; and\r\n     *   Terminable upon written notice by either party, and shall in any event terminate one (1) year from the date of signing; and\r\n     *   Approved as to form by the Commissioner of Public Safety.\r\nSuch contracts shall not be public records and shall not be available for inspection under the provisions of a law providing for the inspection of public records as now or hereafter amended.\r\n\r\n  1.  Special contract investigators shall not be considered employees of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation for any purpose.\r\n  2.  The Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation shall have all powers necessary and incidental to the effective operation of this section.\r\n  3.  The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation shall have jurisdiction to investigate all incidents of officer-involved shootings, other than shootings involving one or more members of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, resulting in injury or death occurring in the state. However, the District Attorney in the jurisdiction where such incident occurred may designate another law enforcement agency to investigate the incident if the District Attorney determines that there is a conflict with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation or that other extenuating circumstances exist. The Attorney General shall designate another law enforcement agency or task force to investigate any incident of a shooting involving one or more members of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation resulting in injury or death occurring in the state. The Attorney General\u2019s Office shall be exclusively responsible for presenting all officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death occurring in the state to the appropriate duly empaneled grand jury and, upon indictment by a grand jury, prosecuting such matters.\r\n  4.  Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this section, all contracts authorized under this section and related matters shall be made available to the Legislative Budget Office and the Department of Finance and Administration.\r\n\r\nYou will find a copy of the statute attached to this email.\r\n\r\nAfter rechecking- the four attached Capitol PD OIS are the only four we have. Also attached are the five JPD OIS redacted incident report MBI worked from 2021 to current. Couldn\u2019t be sure if you were looking at one agency or one area, and it serves no one\u2019s interest for you to have to submit another request for information at hand.\r\n\r\nAll fees associated with this request have been waived.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else with which I can assist you, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nR.E.

Despite the entity reportedly being Organized in California, the California Secretary of State has no Reocord of any business named WLA VA BUILDING 300.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome background information regarding this Request is as follows:\r\n\r\nResponses to prior FOIA's may not have produced any land use agreements for Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home.\r\n\r\nUnited States Veterans Initiative is among entities promoted as \"Principle Developers\", which have been awarded invalid and illegal Enhanced Use Leases, Leases, Revocable Licenses and Access Agreements to privately acquire, control and sub-lease redevelopment of the WLA VA Soldiers Home for purposes including an approximately 450,000 square-foot commercial retail district (aka \"Town Center\") and other illegal uses of the Deed-Restricted WLA VA Soldiers Home in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran homelessness - on a for-profit basis over 50-99 year terms.\r\n\r\nBuilding 300 is a funtional and operational facility developed by the U.S. Federal Government at the West Los Angeles VA Soldiers Home that is under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' management.  Private developers (including United States Veterans Initiative) either intend to obtain or claim to have authorities to convert Building 300 into private property under their private control within Los Angeles County's jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nUS DVA / VA GLAHS Contractor, Concourse Federal, a company in the business of privatizing and liquidating Federal Public Land and Facilities, has at least $85,000,000.00 USD in US DVA consulting fees regarding WLA VA Soldiers Home land use - may have developed, administered and / or coordinated transactions regarding Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home.\r\n\r\nPrevailing authorities at Public Law expressly prohibit private developers from accounting for VA Facilities and land (lawfully) acquired under Enhanced Use Leases as financial collateral.  Given the legal intent of US DVA Enhanced Use Leases are to, among other things, provide cost-saving benefits to US DVA supporting the agency's efforts to care for those who bore the battle - it may be of significant concern that US DVA may have paid any lessee nearly two-million dollars in Public Funds to a disregarded entity, regarding any land use agreement for Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home.\r\n\r\nRecent FOIA's and Federal Contract databases produce no Responsive Documents for legally mandated bids, awards, SDVOSB status, competitor information, congressional reports and other related info about the so-called \"Principal Developers\".  Furthermore, the so-called Principal Developers and VA GLAHS executives primarily operate on a non-transparent and secretive basis; thus little to no additional information beyond a few concept drawings and paragraph about contemplated land use are available to provide regarding Building 300 at this time.\r\n\r\nOther so-called Principal Developers are: Thomas Safran & Associates, Century Housing Corporation and Housing Corporation of America.  Collectively with United States Veterans Initiative, the entities have Organized many California LLC's to mitigate their liabilities regarding unlawful, private WLA VA Soldiers Home redevelopment projects for-profit.  Despite such, they've yet to declare what entities will be the general partner in most to all of the projects they conspire to complete.\r\n\r\nWhile somewhat off-topic, I'll note it appears the illegal US DVA Enhanced Use Lease Agreement with so-called Principal Developers for Building 207 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home, may obligate US DVA to make an approximately $10,500,000.00 USD lump-sum cash payment to the LESSEE; despite that LESSEE already having obtained approximately $50,000,000.00 USD in Public subsidies to remodel the existing building into housing for formerly homeless senior-citizen Veterans with low incomes and HUD VASH Vouchers (as opposed to homeless Veterans risking death on U.S. streets today)... Whereat said LESSEE hasn't delivered a single unit of such housing in approximately five years.  Said Enhanced Use Lease also appears to NOT obligate the LESSEE to pay any lease fees / rents.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",

        "communication": "Freedom of Infomation Act Appeal (Regarding FOIA of VA OIG Tracking Number 23-00012-FOIA)\r\n\r\nOn 10/01/2022 I submitted an FOIA to the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for the following Information quoted in the following two paragraphs...\r\n\r\n\"Copies of any and all written records, including but not limited to: emails, agreements, correspondence, leases, licenses, planning documents, minutes, vendor data, contractor data, grant data, applications, financial transactions, minutes and logs - regarding an entity named \"WLA VA BUILDING 300\".\r\n\r\n\"Schedule R of the 2020 IRS Form 990 Tax Return for United States Veterans Initiative, reports a Disregarded Entity named WLA VA BUILDING 300 with EIN 85-3353491, located at 800 West 6th Street, Ste 1505, Los Angeles, California 90017. The entity's Primary Activity is reported as 'Development of Veteran Housing' with a Total Income of $1,892,208.00 USD and End Of Year Assets of $4,946,563.00 USD; and it's Direct Controlling Entity is Reported as 'United States Veterans Initiative'. Despite the entity reportedly being Organized in California, the California Secretary of State has no Reocord of any business named WLA VA BUILDING 300.\"\r\n\r\nNearly three months later on 12/19/2022 - a \"Government Information Specialist\" for VA OIG responded with two documents:\r\n\r\n1) A letter entitled \"23-00012-FOIA Letter\" dated 12/19/2022 from VA OIG via Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthlee G. Bellamy of VA OIG Release Information Office; stating the Request was received on 12/12/2022, was assigned tracking number 23-00012-FOIA, the Requested Records are not maintained by \"we\", \"we\" did not process the request, a 10/01/2022 VA GLAHS FOIA of undisclosed Tracking Number is considered the same as VA OIG 23-00012-FOIA, the VA GLAHS FOIA of undisclosed Tracking Number was responded to by VA GLAHS on 11/10/2022 and this FOIA (23-00012-FOIA) is being closed by VA OIG without further action.\r\n\r\n2) A letter entitled \"Admin Closure Letter 23-00053-F\" dated 11/10/2022 from VA GALHS \"Acting\" VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System FOIA Officer Kevin Johnson - purportedly regarding VA GLAHS FOIA(s) Requested on 09/26/2022 and 10/04/2022 for Congressionally Mandated Annual Reports, land use agreements from 01/01/2021 onward and records pertaining to WLA VA BUILDING 300; and stating such Request(s) are administratively closed.\r\n\r\nRegarding Building 300 at the WLA VA Soldiers Home - the VA OIG is Required by Federal Public Law 114-226 as Amended, to Audit and Report on all Land Use Agreements (including all leases and enhanced use leases) regarding the WLA VA Soldiers Home.  Given WLA VA Soldiers Home Building 300 exists and is subject to a lease / land use agreement / EUL and in consideration of VA OIG's mandated performance in accordance with Public Law 114-226 - VA OIG must have Records Requested in my 10/01/2022 VA OIG FOIA that was assigned VA OIG Tracking Number 23-00012-FOIA and those Records are being unlawfully suppressed from VA OIG's False \"No Records\" Response to that FOIA...  Unless VA OIG is alternatively evidencing a negligent failure to perform under Federal Public Laws regarding land use at the US DVA's largest managed facility with the highest operating budget; namely the West Los Angeles VA Soldiers Home in Our Country's Capital of Veteran Homelessness.\r\n\r\nDespite the false VA OIG Response to 23-00012-FOIA dated 12/19/2022 purporting a VA GLAHS FOIA of undisclosed Tracking Number is somehow the same as a different FOIA Request to VA GLAHS; notice upon comparing the VA OIG letter to it's attached VA GLAHS letter of 11/10/2022; stated dates of Requests, quantity of Requests and even quantity of Requests are not the same between said letters.\r\n\r\nTo say the least this matter apparently concerns the integrity, performance and intent of VA OIG regarding Requested Information that VA OIG is Required by Federal Public Law to not only posess; but Report, Audit and Assess as well.  It's also a matter pertaining to Information that will benefit the Public and especially disabled homeless Veterans thereamong, in their ongoing efforts to thwart the longstanding criminal racket at the Soldiers Home in Our Country's Capital of Veteran Homelessness that is so frequently, consistently and thoroughly reported on by the Press for decades and counting.  Therefore I respectfully Demand VA OIG accurately, honestly and thoroughly perform in accordance with USC 5 and Public Law 114-226 as Amended by legitimately Responding to my VA OIG FOIA that was assigned VA OIG Tracking Number 23-00012-FOIA without further delay and negligence.\r\n\r\nFor your reference, copies of the aforementioned VA OIG FOIA and \"Acting\" VA GLAHS FOIA letters are attached to this correspondence.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",
