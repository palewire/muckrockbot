To avoid any unwarranted invasions of privacy, I\u2019m specifically seeking the de-identified, aggregate data annually from January 1, 2020, through January 1, 2025, including the following: \r\n   1. The number of adolescent offenders, as well as juvenile offenders, including those granted youthful offender status, under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\r\n   2. Offender demographics including: total arrest dispositions, age at the time of offense, race, gender, and county convicted/adjudicated.\r\n   3. If collected in the same data, demographics of the victim including: age, gender, and race.\r\n   4. If collected in the same data, number of petitions filed and status (approved/denied/in progress). \r\nI ask that, if possible, you provide any potentially responsive records as an electronic spreadsheet or searchable database format. Should you deny this request in whole or in part, I ask that you detail your reasons for doing so in writing, citing the applicable statutes.\r\nThis information is being sought in the regular course of newsgathering on behalf of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism for dissemination to the general public. \r\nI\u2019m requesting that you waive any fees associated with production of potentially responsive records. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how the state and local authorities work together to monitor sex offender status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Maria Guinnip.",

All records concerning the decision to draft, send, and publish your Office's February 3, 2025 letter to Mr. Elon Musk, sent via X.com to \"@elonmusk\" and published on X.com under \"@EagleEdMartin.\"\r\n\r\n2. All records concerning the decision to draft, send, and publish your Office's February 7, 2025 letter to Mr. Elon Musk and Mr. Steve Davis, sent via X.com to \"@elonmusk\" and published on X.com under \"@EagleEdMartin.\"\r\n\r\n3. All records concerning \"the referral of individuals and networks who appear to be stealing government property and/or threatening government employees\" described in your Office's February 7, 2025 letter to Elon Musk and Steve Davis. \r\n\r\n4. All records concerning communications between your office and DOGE (f/k/a United States Digital Service) concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n5. All records concerning communications between your office and Elon Musk concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n6. All records concerning communications between your office and X.com or X Corp. concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n7. All records concerning communications between your office and WIRED (or Wired.com) concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n8. All records concerning communications to or from your office concerning the publication of one or more of following names: Akash Bobba; Edward Coristine; Luke Farritor; Gautier Cole Killian; Gavin Kilger; or Ethan Shaotran.\r\n\r\n9. All records concerning  communications to or from your office about the X.com account \"@RayInsideOut.\"\r\n\r\n10. Any direct messages received at or sent from the X.com account \"@EagleEdMartin\" concerning (a) the February 3, 2025 letter; (b) the February 7, 2025 letter; or (c) the publication of the six names referenced above.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. \r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia becoming involved in a dispute over the disclosure of names of individuals involved with DOGE/US Digital Service and its acts. \r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a breaking news story of public interest. The U.S. Attorney added to the newsworthiness of this matter, posting two recent letters on Twitter threatening investigation of  those who publish information related to DOGE's activities and related current events (those Twitter posts have tens of thousands of engagements). That issue has attracted a wide range of recent news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below.  The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the policies and actions of federal law enforcement concerning the publication of information related to DOGE and related current events. Those policies and decisions are uncertain, as indicated by the US Attorney's letters. Disclosing policies and information pertaining to ongoing decisions and policies facilitates the ability of the public, the press, and advocates to provide feedback with respect to those decisions and policies. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of social media postings and recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include:\r\n\r\nX.com:\r\nhttps://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1887901087983689761\r\nhttps://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1886456136032817488\r\nhttps://x.com/USAO_DC/status/1886537850390483276\r\n\r\nThe New Republic: https://newrepublic.com/post/191087/us-attorney-threaten-target-opponents-elon-musk-doge\r\nThe Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/03/martin-supports-for-musk-doge/\r\nThe New York TImes: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/media/elon-musk-doxxing-marko-elez.html\r\nWestern Journals: https://www.westernjournal.com/elon-just-got-legendary-letter-trumps-doj-threats-doge-finished/\r\nSlate: https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/trump-musk-doge-staffer-resigns-ed-martin-us-attorney-jan-6.html\r\nAxios: https://www.axios.com/2025/02/07/musk-doge-us-attorney-inquiry\r\nNewsweek: https://www.newsweek.com/trump-us-attorney-ed-martin-inquiry-elon-musk-2027976\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia as it pertains to the publications of information about government activities, implicating the Speech and Press clauses of the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Office's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior law enforcement officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles and press statements cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news, and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles) can be found at https://thefire.org/news.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJT Morris",

We are requesting data starting in 2003 through the most recent year with full data availability in the TSLED and AA systems.\r\n\r\nFrom our research we believe this data is collected by various New York State law enforcement agencies and processed with the Traffic and Criminal Software (TraCS). Furthermore, based on the New York State FFY 2024 - 2026 Triennial Highway Safety Plan [found here: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2023-10/NY_FY24HSP-tag.pdf] we have reason to believe that UTT data from TraCS is sent electronically to a central repository, maintained by the NYS ITS (Office of Information Technology Services) before being delivered from the repository to the NYS DMV. Furthermore, based on the Dec. '19 TraCS System Study [found here: http://fltrafficrecords.com/pdf/TraCS%20System%20Study%20-%20Final%20Report%20with%20Appendices.pdf] for the Florida Department of Transportation State Safety Office that New York State Police participated in, we believe that electronic UTT data was first collected via TraCS in 2003 and about 67% of all vehicle tickets given out in New York State are process through TraCS and in the TSLED and AA.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, based on our knowledge the following forms/sections in TraCS should contain some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the UTT data we are requesting:\r\n\"Violations\"\r\n\"Individual\"\r\n\"Vehicle\"\r\n\"Location\"\r\n\"Court\"\r\n\"Sub Dep\"\r\n\"OfficersNotes\"\r\n\"Attach 1\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these are some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the detailed data values that are collected in the TraCS system that we are requesting:\r\n\"Ticket Number\"\r\n\"Police Agency\"\r\n\"Sequence #\"\r\n\"Local Police Code\"\r\n\"Photo Lic Shown\"\r\n\"Last Name(Defendant)\"\r\n\"First Name\"\r\n\"MI\"\r\n\"Suffix\"\r\n\"Number and Street\"\r\n\"Apt.

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files).

If a final determination will not be made within 20 business days of your acknowledgment, please provide a written explanation of the reasons for your agency's inability to grant the request within such time period and specify a date certain within a reasonable period of time when this request will be granted in whole or in part, as required by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3] and 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.5(c)(4).\r\n\r\nIf further clarification is needed in order for your agency to locate the requested records, please immediately contact me.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 84-712 through 84-712.09 (2014, Cum. Supp. 2022). The request is attached to this email for your convenience. For the following reason, the Agency is unable to fulfill this request.\r\n\r\nIn Nebraska, the basic rule for open public records is set out in Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712 (2014). That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \"all citizens of this state and all other persons interested in the examination of the public records\" shall have the right to examine records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memoranda and abstracts from those records, and to obtain copies of records in certain circumstances. The request we received for the records listed above came from MuckRock.com. It requires us to respond to MuckRock.com directly, i.e., either by email to MuckRock.com (preferred) or by U.S. Mail addressed to \"MuckRock News\" in Boston, Massachusetts. However, MuckRock is neither a Nebraska citizen nor an interested person and, as a result, we do not consider this third-party request to be valid under the statute referenced above.\r\n\r\nAlthough no records were withheld due to Muckrock.com's status being not a citizen of the State of Nebraska or an interested party under the NPRA, the Agency provides the following rights to appeal as a convenience:  If you believe the withholding of information requested is in error, you have the right, pursuant to Nebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 84-712.03, to appeal the decision by filing for relief by a writ of mandamus in the District Court in Lancaster County, Nebraska or to petition the Nebraska Attorney General for review of this denial. For the purpose of an appeal, Thomas Skutt is the State official responsible for the decision to deny any portion of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that public records law allows for a charge for the actual cost of collecting, reproducing, and mailing the records you have requested; however, there is no cost for this request.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nThomas Skutt, Jr., JD | Public Records and Discovery Attorney III\r\nLEGAL SERVICES\r\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services\r\nOFFICE: 402-471-7020   |   FAX: 402-742-2374\r\nDHHS.ne.gov<http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/default.aspx>  |  Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/NEDHHS/>  |  Twitter<https://twitter.com/NEDHHS>  |  LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/nebraska-department-of-health-and-human-services>\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message, including any attachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Your denial based solely on MuckRock's non-Nebraska status warrants reconsideration for the following legal and policy reasons:\r\n\r\nLegal Precedent Against Residency Restrictions\r\nCourts have consistently ruled against residency-based restrictions on public records:\r\n\r\n\r\nMcBurney v. Young (2013): While the Supreme Court upheld Virginia's citizens-only FOIA law, it specifically noted this doesn't prevent access through other means or agents\r\nLee v. Minner (3d Cir. 2006): Struck down Delaware's citizens-only restriction as unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause\r\nLanphere & Urbaniak v. State of Colorado (10th Cir. 1994): Found that once records are publicly available, states cannot restrict access based on residency\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Interested Person\" Standard Under Nebraska Law\r\nNebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 84-712's inclusion of \"other persons interested\" demonstrates legislative intent broader than mere residency:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research serves compelling public interests in physician health and patient safety\r\nCross-state comparative analysis benefits Nebraska's healthcare system\r\nNational research on physician health programs directly impacts Nebraska medical practices\r\nThe information will inform evidence-based policy improvements\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications\r\nMultiple constitutional provisions support broad access:\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment protections for gathering information about government operations (Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 1980)\r\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause protection for cross-state research activities\r\nCommerce Clause restrictions on discriminating against out-of-state entities\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Policy and Research Impact\r\nDenying access would:\r\n\r\n\r\nHinder research comparing state approaches to physician health\r\nPrevent identification of best practices that could benefit Nebraska\r\nReduce accountability in programs affecting public safety\r\nCreate unnecessary barriers to academic research\r\n\r\n\r\nEstablished Research Purpose\r\nThis request is part of a comprehensive study of state physician health programs that:\r\n\r\n\r\nExamines varying approaches to physician mental health and substance use\r\nAnalyzes effectiveness of supportive versus punitive interventions\r\nWill produce recommendations for program improvements\r\nBenefits medical professionals and patients nationwide\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Considerations\r\nWhile I could arrange for a Nebraska resident to submit this request, such a workaround:\r\n\r\n\r\nWastes state and requester resources\r\nCreates artificial barriers to legitimate research\r\nContradicts principles of open government\r\nServes no compelling state interest\r\n\r\nI request that you:\r\n\r\nReconsider the denial based on these legal and policy arguments\r\nProcess my request as an \"interested person\" under the statute\r\nProvide a timeline for producing the requested records\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can provide additional documentation of the research purpose and public benefit. Thank you for your consideration.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDr. Vig Sinclair MD",
