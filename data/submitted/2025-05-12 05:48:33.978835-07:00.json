        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any document sufficient to show the members of the Academic Libraries Committee referenced in the May 9, 2025, memorandum entitled \"Reviewing the Department's Military Educational Institution Library Collections,\" issued by Timothy D. Dill, and available at https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/09/2003707607/-1/-1/1/REVIEWING-THE-DEPARTMENTS-MILITARY-EDUCATIONAL-INSTITUTION-LIBRARY-COLLECTIONS.PDF.\r\n\r\n2. Any communication sent to any member of the Academic Libraries Committee (in their capacity as a member of the Committee) referencing \"13950\". \r\n\r\n3. Any \"criteria and procedures\" recommended by the Academic Libraries Committee as referenced in the memorandum dated May 9, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, instant messages, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication. \"Communications\" also includes transcripts, videos, audio, minutes, notes, or other recordings of conversations, meetings, phone calls, or Zoom (or similar) meetings.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social). The Department has previously granted expedited processing to my requests. See, for example, FOID 25-F-2201 (Appeal No. 25-A-2201-A1).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's creation of an \"Academic Libraries Committee\" to determine what educational or academic materials are to be removed from Department institutions.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the information sought will contribute to the public's ability to provide feedback as the Department implements that policy priority. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its officials are currently making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include these articles:\r\n\r\nhttps://apnews.com/article/pentagon-hegseth-dei-library-books-770364ab99591402ddffe8758432ff26\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-05-09/pentagon-dei-academies-library-books-17741389.html\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/pentagon-hegseth-dei-library-books.html\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-orders-military-leaders-to-pull-library-materials-dei/\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/pentagon-dei-gender-ideology-books\r\nhttps://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/10/Pentagon-orders-military-libraries-remove-books-diversity-racism-gender-issues/1041746897357/\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/pentagon-military-academies-review-books\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5293254-pentagon-orders-swift-review-removal-of-library-books-that-address-diversity-anti-racism/\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/politics/naval-academy-banned-books.html\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/dei-purge-holocaust-book-maya-angelou-memoir-pulled-from-naval-academy-library/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/02/naval-academy-remove-400-dei-books/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Department itself issued a press release concerning the memo and the Committee, reflecting the Department's recognition that there is a public interest in timely information about it: https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4180537.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Contracts and Agreements\r\nAll contracts, MOUs, scopes of work, or other service agreements between the University of Oregon and Grand River Solutions executed or in effect from January 1, 2024 to present.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure Authorizations\r\nAny records, approvals, or internal communications authorizing the disclosure of employee disability, accommodation, or civil rights complaint information to Grand River Solutions, including but not limited to any records referencing:\r\n\r\n * \u201cKelvin Shivers II\u201d or \u201cKelvin Shivers\u201d or \u201cKelvin\" \r\n\r\n3. Internal Legal or Risk Review\r\nAny communications between OICRC, HR, General Counsel, or external consultants regarding the legality, advisability, or risk of disclosing employee medical or accommodation-related records to Grand River Solutions.\r\n\r\n4. Communications With Grand River Solutions\r\nAll emails or written communications between any University of Oregon employee and any representative of Grand River Solutions from January 1, 2025 to present that reference:\r\n\r\n   * \u201cKelvin Shivers II\u201d or \u201cKelvin Shivers\u201d or \u201cKelvin\"\r\n   * \u201cADA\u201d or \u201caccommodation\u201d\r\n   * \u201ccivil rights complaint\u201d or \u201cretaliation\u201d \r\n\r\n5. Policies or Training Materials\r\nAll institutional policies, training materials, or written guidance regarding the sharing of employee ADA, accommodation, or medical information with third-party consultants or investigators, in effect from January 1, 2024 to present.\r\n\r\n6. Redacted Copy of Shared Record\r\nIf permissible, a redacted copy of any employee-related records provided to Grand River Solutions that reference Kelvin Shivers II, with personally identifying medical information removed to the extent required by law.\r\n\r\nI am also formally requesting that the University of Oregon preserve all records related to my ADA accommodation requests, disability disclosures, civil rights complaints, and any internal or external communications referencing me or these matters.\r\n\r\nThis includes\u2014but is not limited to\u2014records held by the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance (OICRC), HR/ELR, Workplace ADA, General Counsel, School of Music and Dance, Oregon Bach Festival and any third-party vendors (e.g., Grand River Solutions).\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the public interest. It relates directly to a matter involving potential civil rights violations, ADA-protected accommodations, and government transparency. The requested records concern the treatment of a disabled employee, and their disclosure will contribute to public understanding of institutional compliance with state and federal law.\r\n\r\nAs such, I respectfully request that any fees be waived in accordance with ORS 192.324(5), which permits fee waivers when disclosure is in the public interest and is not primarily for personal benefit.\r\n\r\nThis request is time-sensitive and directly relates to an ongoing civil rights matter. If portions of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, please release all segregable non-exempt material as required by ORS 192.338. If you deny any part of this request, please provide a written explanation citing the specific legal exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nPlease note: This request and any related public disclosures constitute legally protected activity under ADA Title V (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203), ORS 659A.109, and the First Amendment. Any adverse action or administrative interference in response to this request may be considered unlawful retaliation and will be documented accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request. I am willing to discuss ways to narrow the scope if necessary to facilitate timely release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelvin Shivers II",

The number of public records requests submitted to the University of Oregon from @uoregon.edu email addresses during this period, including:\r\n\r\n* date received\r\n* date acknowledged\r\n* date of fulfillment or estimated completion\r\n\r\n2. The number of times, since June 1, 2023, that UO\u2019s Public Records Office responded to a requester with the following or materially similar language:\r\n\r\n* \u201c...a public official\u2026 may not rely on the Public Records Law to obtain records, although the individual may do so in their individual capacity.\u201d\r\n* \u201c(State of Oregon Department of Justice Attorney General\u2019s Public Records and Meetings Manual, 2024, pg. 1)\u201d\r\n* \u201cIt would be appreciated if you could provide the office with a different email address... Any future public records requests should also be submitted from a personal email account.\u201d\r\n* Please include any internal policy, directive, guidance, or email template instructing staff to send this language to employees using @uoregon.edu email addresses.\r\n\r\n3. Any internal communications, guidance, or legal memos the University has relied on to justify discouraging or deprioritizing public records requests submitted from @uoregon.edu email addresses. This includes any materials referencing the DOJ Manual citation above, or any interpretation that treats employee use of a university email address as disqualifying.\r\n\r\n4. Any internal communications or records referencing public records requests submitted by me, Kelvin Shivers II, or from kelvin@uoregon.edu, including discussions of response timelines, delays, special handling, or instructions.\r\n\r\n5. Please provide any records or documentation showing how the University reconciles its interpretation of the DOJ Manual\u2019s statement that \u201ca public official\u2026 may not rely on the Public Records Law\u201d with the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Jordan v. MVD, 308 Or. 433 (1989), which held that the identity or motive of the requester is irrelevant under Oregon public records law. If the University interprets employee use of a university email address as limiting or restricting public records rights, please identify any legal authority, case law, internal legal opinion, or written directive supporting that position. This includes, but is not limited to, any guidance or consultation received following the University\u2019s awareness of my current ADA-related status or health condition, including any communication dated on or after May 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the public interest to evaluate whether UO is selectively enforcing legal interpretations in a way that may disadvantage employees engaged in protected activity under the ADA, Section 504, ORS 659A.030, or university policy.\r\n\r\nI also request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5), as this request concerns civil rights enforcement and institutional accountability.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Oregon Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPursuant to ORS 192.324, I am formally requesting a copy of the full video and/or audio recording of my January 8, 2025 interview with OICRC investigator Shane Lesher. This interview was conducted as part of a civil rights complaint against my supervisor of the Oregon Bach Festival for retaliation in which I was the complainant and contains my own statements. It is directly relevant to the University\u2019s decision to dismiss my complaint without a formal investigation.\r\n\r\nI initially requested this recording from the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance on April 14, 2025. Despite multiple follow-up attempts over the past month, no acknowledgment or fulfillment has been provided. This delay is now well outside the legal response timelines established under ORS 192.324 and ORS 192.329. The lack of transparency raises serious concerns, especially given that this record may contain evidence relevant to ADA-related retaliation and due process violations stemming from the complaint I submitted to OICRC\u2014one they declined to investigate and then used that decision to justify denying me due process protections.\r\n\r\nAs the individual recorded, and the complainant in the matter, I request that this record be released in full. If any portion is withheld, I request that the University cite the specific exemption under ORS 192.345 or ORS 192.355, conduct the required public interest balancing test under ORS 192.311, and release all non-exempt portions as required by ORS 192.329(5).\r\n\r\nI also request a full waiver of any associated fees under ORS 192.324(5). Disclosure of this material serves the public interest by promoting accountability and transparency in the handling of civil rights complaints by a public institution. The recording is directly relevant to potential violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and ORS 659A.030. Releasing it will inform systemic concerns affecting not only my case, but the broader treatment of employees with disabilities at the University of Oregon.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated response timeline.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelvin Shivers II",
