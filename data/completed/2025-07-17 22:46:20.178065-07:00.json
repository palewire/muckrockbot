Specific and unique terms or phrases are best or you can choose to use the + so that the first term/phrase + the second term/phrase must be in the email to be responsive (ie. \"PTSA Clubs Program\" + \"student safety\").The Department of Technology team is responsive to email/google chat pulls and all documents are reviewed to ensure that releasing them does not violate any federal or state law. \r\n**Note the district can search by groups of people (ie. HR department or legal department) but your request involves a 100+ employees. I would expect on average to each of them to conduct a search of their files for responsive documents on average would take 10 minutes (some shorter and some much longer). My recommendation would be to focus your request on those who you know have records responsive to your request and you can always submit a new request based on the documents you receive and review. Respond to this email with the details requested above. Upon receipt of clarification, the Denver Public Schools (DPS) will further respond to your public records request as required by law.\u00a0 If clarification is not received within 15 business days from the date of this email, this request will be closed.

However, based on the breakdown, it appears those paired terms were searched separately rather than together. For example, \u201cstudent\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d appear to have been run individually, which resulted in over 13,000 records\u2014definitely not the intended outcome.\r\n\r\nTo help reduce volume and return more relevant results, I\u2019d appreciate it if the attached paired terms could be searched using \u201cAND\u201d logic\u2014where both terms appear within the same document. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also reviewed the rest of the terms and removed some of the broader ones from consideration to help keep the search more targeted. Attached is a breakdown of:\r\n\r\n- The combined search terms I\u2019d like searched using \u201cAND\u201d logic\r\n- The individual terms already searched that I\u2019d still like included in the next round\r\n- The individual terms already searched that I\u2019d like removed from the next record count and estimate\r\n\r\nOnce the updated search is complete, please let me know the revised count of unique responsive records and any associated cost estimate. I\u2019m happy to continue refining the scope if needed.\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if anything in the attachment needs clarification or if there\u2019s a preferred format that would make things easier on your end.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help in moving this forward.\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatrick Quigley\r\n",

These records concern internal communications within Denver Public Schools (DPS) related to two key incidents at Centennial School for Expeditionary Learning involving the Centennial PTSA and myself (Patrick Quigley): \r\n\r\n- An October 23, 2024 incident in which PTSA Committee Co-Chair Michelle Frankel yelled and used profanity toward me, a parent volunteer, on school grounds and in front of students. \r\n- A set of claims made on March 6, 2025, by PTSA Treasurer Eric Lyche, alleging that I violated policy, removed a student from the PTSA Clubs Program, and caused emotional distress to a parent. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, \u201ccommunications\u201d includes, but is not limited to: emails, text messages, meeting notes or summaries, records of phone or in-person conversations, chat messages (including Slack or Microsoft Teams), calendar invites, agendas, and any written or recorded documentation\u2014including internal drafts or materials created by DPS personnel for internal use. \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\r\nPlease produce all communications and records exchanged between or among the following DPS individuals or departments: \r\n\r\n- Scott Wolf, Director of Operational Services \r\n- Emily Volkert, Principal at Centennial \r\n- DPS Human Resources, including Alui Kouassi \r\n- DPS Legal or Risk Management personnel \r\n- DPS Communications personnel \r\n- Regional or instructional superintendents \r\n- Family and Community Engagement (FACE) \r\n- Volunteer Services (or department responsible for volunteer management / support) \r\n\r\n...that reference or relate to: \r\n\r\n- The October 2024 or March 2025 incidents \r\n- Any use or discussion of my name in connection with those incidents, my volunteer role, or related complaints \r\n- Internal guidance, recommendations, or direction\u2014including from Mr. Wolf to Principal Volkert\u2014regarding how to manage, respond to, or characterize either incident or any related communications involving the PTSA or me \r\n- Internal evaluations or concerns regarding my volunteer role, including reputational risk, conflict management, or parent complaints \r\n- Discussions or evaluations of DPS Board Policy KFA and its applicability to either incident \r\n- Any internal discussion or evaluation of assumed risk, liability, or legal exposure for volunteers participating in programs on DPS campuses, including whether volunteers are considered covered, protected, or personally liable under DPS policy or practice \r\n- Oversight of or internal evaluations related to the PTSA Clubs Program, including PTSA conduct, safety practices, volunteer management, policy compliance, or DPS\u2019s responsibility for incidents involving PTSA volunteers \r\n- Responses to my complaints or requests for retraction, including any internal assessment of reputational risk or incident handling \r\n\r\nPlease exclude records entirely unrelated to the individuals, incidents, or volunteer role described above (e.g., general personnel matters or unrelated school operations). \r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request yields no responsive records, I request confirmation of that outcome. If any records are withheld or redacted, please cite the specific legal exemption under \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a), C.R.S., and provide a general description of the withheld material. \r\n\r\nIf clarification or narrowing would expedite fulfillment, please notify me at your earliest convenience. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPatrick Quigley \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdenver-public-schools-5864%252Fdps-internal-records-on-ptsa-incidents-centennial-oct-2024-mar-2025-186885%252F%253Femail%253Dcora%252540dpsk12.org&url_auth_token=AABOPm4MTqHlrCgJ-bwXFFls9Es%3A1uI1Bf%3A0lrZk2peXWorARE32e9arZ0PwDQwv0cjhH83i52mqIM \r\nPreviously, clarifications were requested: \r\nFor the email/google chat search portion, please provide the search terms/phrases that you believe would be in a responsive email. Specific and unique terms or phrases are best or you can choose to use the + so that the first term/phrase + the second term/phrase must be in the email to be responsive (ie. \"PTSA Clubs Program\" + \"student safety\"). \r\n\r\nThe Department of Technology team is responsive to email/google chat pulls and all documents are reviewed to ensure that releasing them does not violate any federal or state law. \r\nRespond to this email with the details requested above. \r\nUpon receipt of clarification, the Denver Public Schools (DPS) will further respond to your public records request as required by law.\u00a0 If clarification is not received within 5 business days from the date of this email, this request will be closed. \r\nFor questions or additional information, please reply to this email. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSTACY WHEELER \r\nLegal Department",

After review, I would like to ask for several refinements aimed at significantly reducing the scope and helping your team efficiently isolate the relevant material.\r\n\r\nThese changes apply only to the email and Google Chat portions of the request due to volume concerns. All other requested document types\u2014such as texts, meeting notes, calendar items, or internal drafts\u2014should remain under the original full scope.\r\n\r\nPlease limit the search of email and Google chat to these accounts and dates:\r\nScott Wolf: November 11 \u2013 November 22, 2024, and March 17 \u2013 May 22, 2025\r\nEmily Volkert: October 23 \u2013 November 22, 2024, and February 18 \u2013 May 22, 2025\r\nAlui Kouassi: November 4 \u2013 December 5, 2024\r\n\r\nPlease further narrow the results to include only records where at least two of the above individuals appear as sender, recipient, or CC. This should help focus the pull on internal handling and cross-departmental coordination while filtering out isolated or unrelated communications.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also attached a revised list of keyword terms to refine the scope further. Terms are structured using Boolean logic (e.g., volunteer AND (oversight OR policy OR complaint OR risk)). If this format is incompatible with your system, please let me know the preferred syntax and I\u2019ll revise accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo reduce cost and avoid duplication, I also request that your team consolidate and deduplicate any records that appear under multiple terms, custodians, or systems. If a single record matches more than one search condition, I ask that only one copy be included in the results.\r\n\r\nIf possible, once the updated filters are applied, could your team please provide:\r\n- A revised, deduplicated record count\r\n- A brief sample (10\u201315 records) from the resulting set so I can verify relevance before proceeding with full review\r\n\r\nIf any aspect of these refinements poses a technical challenge or requires adjustment for DoTS compatibility, please let me know and I\u2019ll revise accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your work on this.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatrick Quigley",

        "communication": "Ms. Wheeler,\r\nThank you for providing the responsive records and privilege log for CORA request #R000523-052225. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve reviewed the documents, privilege log, and sworn statement regarding withheld materials. After reviewing the relevant CORA statutes and consulting with the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition (CFOIC), I\u2019d like to respectfully request the following:\r\n\r\n1. Supplement to the Privilege Log\r\nUnder CORA \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a)(XIII), the sworn statement accompanying any withheld records must:\r\n\u201cspecifically describe each document withheld, explain why each such document is privileged, and why disclosure would cause substantial injury to the public interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis standard was further clarified in Complete Colorado v. HCPF (Denver District Court, 2023), where the court found that general references to the \u201cdeliberative process\u201d were not enough. The agency was ordered to provide a document-by-document justification, including a clear explanation of the anticipated harm to the public interest from disclosure.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the privilege log does not include this level of detail. It generally states that disclosure of all withheld records would \u201cstifle honest and frank discussion,\u201d but does not explain how this applies to each specific document or why that harm outweighs public access in each instance. I respectfully request a supplement to the privilege log providing the specific justification required for each withheld document.\r\n\r\n2. Redacted Versions of Withheld Records\r\nWhere applicable, I request that the district release redacted versions of any withheld documents, removing only those specific portions deemed privileged or confidential. \r\n\r\nThis approach aligns with the intent of CORA and the Colorado Court of Appeals ruling in Ritter v. Jones (2009), which affirmed that partial disclosure is appropriate when a document contains both public and exempt material.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatrick Quigley",

Please be advised that records are not organized or tagged according to distance from specific coordinates. Therefore, numerous records must be searched for and pulled before an additional step can be made to determine if the subject matter concerns activity within the specific geographic radiuses. We estimate that several thousands of pages of material must be pulled, with personnel spending approximately three weeks, or 120 hours on the search and compilation aspect of the response. \r\n\r\nOnce responsive records are located, and additional manual work of segregation and redaction will begin. As you may have seen or will soon see, the MBTA filed a fee petition seeking permission to charge for segregating and redacting records to the extent they contain information exempted under the Public Records Law. We currently estimate that 10-20,000 pages of material will need to be reviewed for segregation and redaction at 2 minutes per page. \r\n\r\nOnce the records are reproduced in final form, they can be transmitted to you. \r\nEstimated time to complete described work \r\n\r\nSearch and compilation time: 120.00 hours \r\n\r\nSegregation and redaction time: 500.00 hours \r\n\r\nReproduction time: 5.00 hours \r\n\r\nTotal estimated time: 625.00 hours \r\nHourly rate and estimated fee \r\n\r\nHourly rate: $25.00/hour. This hourly rate is equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the records requested. \r\n\r\nNo fee will be assessed for the first four hours of work. Therefore, the estimated cost of complying with your request is 621 hours of chargeable work at $25.00 per hour, or $15,525.00. This amount must be paid in advance and is just an estimate, which may change when the work is actually performed. If you would like the MBTA to perform the work described above, kindly send a check in the amount of $150.00 payable to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, to my attention at 10 Park Plaza, Suite 3510, Boston, MA 02116. Additionally, we are happy to discuss an alternate scope so that records may be transmitted to you in a more efficient and affordable manner. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJulie Ciollo \r\nAssistant General Counsel/ \r\nRecords Access Officer",

Specifically, the Supervisor of Records asked that the MBTA do the following: the Authority must clarify how it requires 120 hours to search for responsive records and 5 hours to reproduce responsive records. The Authority must also provide additional information regarding the tasks necessary to produce the responsive records. You have submitted 10 broad and at times vague requests. All of your requests ask for numerous categories of records, including the following:\u00a0incident reports, arrest records, daily or monthly incident logs, and internal communications \u2014 including emails, text messages, or direct messages sent via platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, or similar,\u00a0daily or monthly incident summary logs maintained by Transit Police,\u00a0internal memoranda, threat assessments, or safety alerts issued by Transit Police,\u00a0maintenance logs, service requests, or incident reports generated by MBTA Facilities, Customer Support, or contracted vendors,\u00a0memoranda, emails, correspondence, or reports originating from MBTA Legal, Risk Management, or third-party insurers that reference public safety risks, legal liability, or potential claims,\u00a0work logs, service reports, and internal or contractor-submitted records relating to sanitation, shelter maintenance, needle/biohazard removal, or encampment response,\u00a0EMS or overdose response records received, logged, or shared with MBTA Transit Police or Facilities, staff dispatch records, overdose response logs, or incident summaries from January 1, 2023 to present,\u00a0all injury logs, incident reports, union grievances, or OSHA filings made by MBTA employees or contractors concerning assaults, injuries, or unsafe working conditions,\u00a0internal communications regarding a decision not to issue a public safety bulletin, formal rider alert, or other public warning. Further, you have restricted the above categories to records related to a wide range of geographic areas. A full response will require numerous personnel across numerous MBTA departments to query databases or perform manual searches to compile potentially responsive areas. Because records are not categorized by proximity to a certain location, a manual review must take place to ensure that the subject matter matching your request comports with the chosen geographic areas. This work is compounded by the fact that you have chosen a time period of over two and a half years across every category of request. Given the numerous departments needed to engage on your requests, the dozens of categories of records, and the need for an extensive manual search to determine which records comport to the chosen geographic areas, we estimate each request may take at least 12 hours to complete the search and compilation portion of the MBTA's response. Please note that the MBTA does not permit tex messaging to be used for substantive business communications. If you wish you pursue any portion of your requests asking for text messages, please know that this is a manual search requiring an inspection of every MBTA-issued text-enabled device, of which there are hundreds if not thousands. The MBTA estimates at least 5 hours of reproduction time, which comports to 30 minutes per request. This work includes reproducing records in a redacted format once redactions have been applied, or uploading records that do not require any redaction. To the extent not already specified, the tasks needed to provide you with a full response include querying numerous databases and servers, reviewing records by hand to determine subject matter responsiveness, segregating and redacting responsive records, and reproducing records for you. Please be advised that the MBTA reserves the right to update this response or the fee estimate as the tasks involved in providing you with a response may change once the work is begun. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \nSincerely, \nJulie Ciollo Assistant General Counsel/ Records Access Officer\n",

We cannot provide you records we do not have.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you desire to see the application materials completed in the online portal, you may want to submit a request to the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.

For reference, the investigation took place after 2011, and the alleged abuse took place at Albion Correctional Facility.\r\n\r\nThe records I am requesting include records related to complaints, allegations, and charges, regardless of whether those complaints, allegations, and/or charges were substantiated. Per the February 20, 2025, Court of Appeals decision in Matter of New York Civil Liberties Union v. City of Rochester (2025 NY Slip Op 01010), the personal privacy exemption contained in Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(b) does not allow agencies to withhold complaints simply because they were not substantiated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChris Gelardi",

The city or county agency will contact you concerning your request and inform you whether there are public records responsive to your request, if all or part of those public records are not disclosable to you, and the statutory basis for any denial. Information pertaining to any copying fees that may be related to obtaining copies will be provided. \nPlease Note:\u00a0 With respect to public records requests that include e-mail communications, we want to make you aware that these requests generally take longer than requests for other types of information.\u00a0 First, the City/County receives a large number of requests for email communications, not just public records requests but also related to legal proceedings.\u00a0 We rely upon our information technology agency to perform these searches and that agency runs these searches (based\u00a0 upon reasonably particular search terms as set forth by the State Public Access Counselor) in the order in which the requests are received.\u00a0 Once the email search is completed, there must also be a review of the content of the email communications to ensure that they are not only responsive to your request but also disclosable.\u00a0 Finally, disclosable email communications will be produced after this review and if we do not disclose all or part of these email communications, we will provide the statutory bases for such denials as required under the APRA. \nThe APRA requires public agencies to produce responsive and disclosable public records, should they exist, within a reasonable time based upon the circumstances.\u00a0 \u00a0Please allow the agency time to review and process your request. \nWhile there is no fixed due date for a response, if more than 30 days have passed since your last communication with the agency, feel free to contact the Public Access Counselor to check the status. \nYou may reach the Public Access Counselor at 317.327.4055 or PAC@indy.gov. \nThank you, \nCity of Indianapolis and Marion County\n",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use.

        "communication": "Dear Ed Burton,\r\n\r\nApologies for the delay. I am applying a number to each of your requested items for ease of reference, as well as, providing a response in red to each item.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any risk assessments, emergency or incident response plans produced by the University of California Davis between April 20, 2024 and the time that this request is processed that mention any of the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\n\r\nPlease see The UC Davis Police Policy Manual found at  Police Department - UC Davis Police Policy<https://police.ucdavis.edu/professional-standards/policies> for current information regarding risk assessments, emergency or incident response plans.  I am also searching for any additional documents that may exist after publication of this manual. All information identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date for production of the requested records is on or around November 11th, 2024.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any reports or logs about surveillance activities on pro-Palestine or pro-Israel student protesters on the University of California Davis campus, produced by the university, university police, or local police. These may include written reports based on CCTV camera footage, reports of relevant social media posts, plans for future surveillance, etc., between April 20, 2024 and the time that this request is processed.\r\nPlease see The UC Davis Police Policy Manual found at  Police Department - UC Davis Police Policy<https://police.ucdavis.edu/professional-standards/policies> for current information regarding social media, video, and facial recognition surveillance information.  Any student related information, if existed, would be denied pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g).  Subsequently, they are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d), as the PRA allows the University to withhold records from disclosure where disclosure of the records is exempt or prohibited under federal or state law (Government Code \u00a7 7927.700).\r\n\r\nAs I\u2019m sure you are aware, FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of records directly pertaining to students, and generally prohibits the disclosure of such records to the public without the consent of the affected student(s).  (34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31).  In this case, the records you have requested are \u201ceducation records\u201d that contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d about a student.  (34 CFR 99.3).  The records cannot feasibly be redacted to protect the identity of the student (i.e. cannot be de-identified), and therefore can only be released with the student\u2019s consent.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any email correspondence between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed, that mention the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\nUC has considered your request and before we can acknowledge it, we need to address the fact that it\u2019s overly broad. Even \u201ca clearly framed request\u201d may be unduly burdensome if it \u201crequires an agency to search an enormous volume of data for a \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019 or conversely, \u2026compels the production of a huge volume of material.\u201d  California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 166. You have not selected custodians which is necessary to perform an email search. You have provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. UC Davis has responded to several public records requests related to your keywords. We will produce those records because they are the result of similar searches, and we believe they are also responsive to your request. Once you review those documents you may submit a public records request with specific information to conduct a search for potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe estimated date for production of these previously released records is on or around October 1st, 2024.\r\n\r\n4. Any agreements (including informal, not-signed, or draft agreements that would take place over email) or memoranda between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Regents, the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and UC Davis Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nA search for responsive records was conducted and it has been determined no records exist pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\r\nAt this time, items #2 and #4 are considered closed. Items #1 has an estimated date for production of on or around November 11th, 2024. Items #3 has an estimated date for production of these records is on or around October 1st, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHeather Urzua\r\nLegal Operations Manager\r\nUC Legal \u2013 UC Davis Office of the Campus Counsel\r\nOne Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616\r\nPhone: 530-754-6295\r\nhttps://campuscounsel.ucdavis.edu/",

I have also copied in the response for ease of reference. However, it was determined that similar previous records releases would be provided to you as they contained a similar search criteria. Upon further review of those records, we intended to release to you, it was discovered that yes, the custodian and keywords were similar, the date reference was not. Therefore, we are uncertain if the previous release would be responsive to your request.\r\nTo summarize, you have selected departments, however, specific custodians are necessary to perform an email search. You have also provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. For the keywords, we would ask that you narrow and prioritize the list to allow us to conduct a search for a reasonable number of records. We will then acknowledge your request and provide records to you on a rolling basis. I\u2019d like to propose a few options to assist you in getting the records you want as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Confirm the UC Davis custodians you are interested in. Below is a suggestion of custodians:\r\n     *   Chancellor, Gary May\r\n     *   Vice Chancelor, Pablo Reguerin\r\n  *   Narrow a timeframe\r\n  *   Identify a specific record\r\n  *   We can release previous communications related to the same departments and keywords to you. However, the date range is not similar.\r\n  *   Prioritize your keyword list. At this time, you have requested:\r\n\r\n  1.  protests\r\n  2.  demonstrations\r\n  3.  occupation\r\n  4.  camp\r\n  5.  encampment\r\n  6.  Israel\r\n  7.  Gaza\r\n  8.  Palestine\r\n  9.  Anti-semitism\r\n  10. Islamophobia\r\n  11. PULP\r\n  12. Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine\r\nPlease note, it is possible exempt exemptions may apply to some of these records. These exemptions could include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\u00b7         Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Exempt from disclosure pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g). FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of records directly pertaining to students, and generally prohibits the disclosure of such records to the public without the consent of the affected student(s).  (34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31).\r\n\r\n3. Any email correspondence between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed, that mention the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\n           UC has considered your request and before we can acknowledge it, we need to address the fact that it\u2019s overly broad.

Franklin Rd Ewing, IL and\r\n14425 Rescue Church Rd, Whittingon, IL.\r\n\r\nThere are no documents submitted reporting residency fraud with the above\r\nnames or addresses listed in our files.\r\n\r\nDocuments pertaining to the request for redistricting of 16178 E. Franklin\r\nRd Ewing, IL.\r\n\r\nI have attached the petition, secretary's report, proof of publication,\r\nOrder of denial of petition request, verbatim records from the court\r\nreporter, a letter of rehearing request from the petitioner, and a letter\r\nof denial of rehearing from the Regional Board of School Trustees.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of policy for investigating reports of residency fraud.\r\n\r\nThere is no policy for investigating residency fraud.  Districts have\r\nresidency policies by statute.  In instances where residency is being\r\nskirted, districts can hold residency hearings to remove those in\r\nviolation.  The Regional Superintendent of Schools is tasked with any\r\nappeals that result from such hearings.  I have none on record.  In\r\ninstances where violations are made known to me, a phone contact is made\r\nwith the school districts for them to pursue.\r\n\r\nDocument showing number of fraud claims made annually and if possible\r\nbroken down by adjudication status.\r\n\r\nA search of my correspondence shows 1 file on hand for a residency\r\ncomplaint (letter was anonymous).   I am including that letter,  with names\r\nredacted due to the very small nature of the district involved which would\r\nrisk the possibility of identifying the children involved.\n*Matt Renaud*\r\n*Regional Superintendent of Schools*\r\n*Regional Office of Education #13*\r\n*Clinton-Jefferson-Marion-Washington Counties*",

I am not requesting final plans, applications, or board packets already posted online. I specifically seek non-published communications such as internal emails, memos, meeting notes, and text messages created or received between January 1, 2023 and the date this request is fulfilled.\r\n\r\n1. All internal or external communications involving BPDA staff, City legal staff, or developers (including Dream Collaborative or Madison Park) discussing:\r\n\r\n* Strategies to avoid Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) review\r\n* Use of PDA designation or Urban Renewal overlays to bypass traditional zoning or appeal processes\r\n* Decisions to phase the project under 50,000 square feet to avoid triggering Article 80 Large Project Review\r\n* Any aggregation analysis across project phases under Article 80\r\n\r\n2. All communications, internal memos, or analysis discussing whether the Harrison parking lot project should have undergone Large Project Review under Article 80, including debate about scope, timing, or whether other parcels should be considered part of the same project.\r\n\r\n3. All communications (including email, text, or Teams/Slack messages) between BPDA staff or the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing related to implementation of the 10% homeless housing set-aside policy for this project. This includes discussions of:\r\n\r\n* Whether the policy applies to Phase One or future phases\r\n* Concerns about addiction, mental health, or service requirements for residents\r\n* Site-level management or public safety considerations for set-aside units\r\n\r\n4. Any emails, memos, or internal notes referencing whether to notify or exclude Worcester Square Area Neighborhood Association (WSANA), Chester Square, or other neighborhood groups near the site. Include any explanation for limiting notice or tailoring outreach away from legal abutters.\r\n\r\n5. Any emails or discussions justifying why this project was treated as part of Plan Nubian despite being outside the published boundary, including any political or planning rationale for doing so.\r\n\r\n6. Any internal communications regarding the collection or filtering of public comments, including:\r\n\r\n* Use of template letters or coordination with third parties to submit public support\r\n* Filtering of comments by zip code, abutter status, or affiliation\r\n* Internal tallies or comment summaries distinguishing support vs opposition\r\n\r\nPlease provide the above records in digital form. If any part is withheld, provide a written explanation citing the applicable exemption under G.L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26), and release any non-exempt portions.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian McCarter",

I\u2019m now following up to ensure the search scope fully captures all responsive records in BPDA Planning\u2019s custody.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the six proposed search terms, I\u2019d like to request the addition of a few targeted terms to help ensure complete coverage of the original request:\r\n\r\n\u201cnotice\u201d OR \u201cmailing\u201d OR \u201ccertified\u201d OR \u201cUSPS\u201d OR \u201cabutter\u201d\r\n\u201cnotification policy\u201d OR \u201cnotice procedure\u201d OR \u201cabutter notice\u201d\r\n\u201cvendor\u201d OR \u201cmail service\u201d OR \u201cmailing coordination\u201d\r\n\u201clegal notice\u201d OR \u201cnotice requirement\u201d\r\n\r\nThese are aimed at capturing records related to abutter notification, distribution methods, internal coordination, and legal compliance.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I work to better understand how this request was routed, could you clarify whether the City\u2019s Records Access Officer typically forwards overlapping requests to both BPDA and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing when the subject matter clearly involves both departments? In this case, I don\u2019t see evidence that a parallel search was initiated at MOH, despite its role in the project.\r\n\r\nPlanning has been consistently helpful on past requests, and I appreciate your continued engagement on this one.

        "communication": "Hello Brian,\r\n\r\nI hope you are doing well.\r\n\r\nThis email shall act as the Planning Department's response to your request\r\nfor public records received on June 8, 2025. This response applies only to\r\nrecords that exist and are in the custody of the Planning Department. *(See\r\n\"A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law\", (2022) p. 32, n. 115).*\r\n\r\nIn answer to your public records request, please find the responsive\r\nrecords\u202fthrough the link below:\r\n\r\n*PRR 6.8.2025 - BWSC Parking Lots*\r\n<https://bpda.box.com/s/uuipkwpxfjn4s46j7cbop2yfuuh2n0x1>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a\u202fpresumption\u202funder the Massachusetts Public Records Law that\r\ngovernment records are public; however, government records custodians are\r\npermitted to redact or withhold portions of public records, so long as a\r\nspecific exemption to the law is cited.\u202f(*See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))*\r\n\r\nThe Planning Department has exercised (2) exemptions in reviewing your\r\nrequest:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Attorney-Client\u202fPrivilege -  We have\u202fwithheld\u202fone (1) email based on t\r\n   he attorney-client\u202fprivilege. The withheld record represents staff\r\n   seeking legal advice from department attorneys and/or department\r\n   attorneys providing legal advice. The request for legal advice was made\r\n   upon the expectation of confidentiality by the Planning Department staff as\r\n   a client. Disclosure of the withheld records would be a waiver of attorney\r\n   client privilege, and as a client, the Planning Department does not\r\n   intend to waive its privilege. The included privilege log satisfies the\r\n   disclosure requirements of Massachusetts law, as it includes \u201cthe names of\r\n   the author and recipients, the date, the substance of such record,\u201d and\r\n   this response satisfies a description of \u201cthe grounds upon which\r\nthe attorney\r\n   client privilege is being claimed.\u201d  See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A(a); 950 CMR\r\n   32.06(3)(d).\r\n\r\n   2. Privacy Exemption -  All personal cell phone numbers and email\r\n   addresses have been redacted pursuant to the second clause of the\r\nprivacy exemption\r\n   set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c). The Planning Department determined\r\n   that the release of personal cell phone numbers and personal email\r\n   addresses would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, as this\r\n   information constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" and\r\n   is not otherwise available for public consumption. It is the position of\r\n   the Planning Department that the privacy interests of the individuals\r\n   outweigh any public interest in its release.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDanielle\r\n\r\n*Under Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. (G.L. c.\n66,\u202f\u00a7\u202f10A; 950 CMR 32.08)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*----*\r\n\r\nDanielle Cournoyer (pronouns she/her/hers)\r\n\r\n Public Records Specialist\r\n\r\n Planning Department\r\n\r\n City of Boston\r\n\r\n 617-918-4448 (w)",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to Fred Lee Crisman (July 22, 1919 -  December 10, 1975), who was an author from Tacoma, Washington known for claims of paranormal events and 20th century conspiracies. In 1947, Crisman was involved in the Maury Island incident, an early UFO hoax. In 1969, Crisman was subpoenaed by Jim Garrison to testify in the case against Clay Shaw in the John F. Kennedy assassination. During this time, he hosted a radio talk show under the pseudonym \"Jon Gold\" and wrote a book, The Murder of a City, Tacoma published in 1970 through Transistor Publishing Company. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had analyzed and compared the photographs of the \"tramps\" with those of Crisman. Conspiracy authors consider Crisman a nexus point for a number of conspiracies and cover-ups from the late 1940s until his death in 1975. His death has been widely reported. \r\n\r\nPlease include records relating to the June 1947 hoax known as the Maury Island Incident, which refers to claims made by Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl of falling debris and threats by men in black following sightings of unidentified flying objects in the sky over Maury Island in Puget Sound. I am also requesting a cross-reference search with the people and events described in the above paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

The FBI has located approximately 2948 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll communications that include the term \"Gulf of America\" or \"renaming the Gulf of Mexico\".\r\n\r\nThis should include\u2013but not be limited to\u2014emails, notes, memoranda and presentations between USGS staff and between USGS staff and external third parties.\r\n\r\nPlease include all documentation within the period January 1, 2024 to January 22, 2025, inclusive.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Mr. Dave Levinthal, assigned control number DOI-2025-003169, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the Office of the Director, Office of Communications and Publishing, U.S. Board on Geographic Names, Office of the Alaska Regional Director, and Office of the Southeast Regional Director.\r\n\r\n1. Any records and documents \u2014 including but not limited to emails, memoranda, notes, electronic chat messages and calendar items \u2014 that include any of the following words/names in either uppercase or lowercase form on changing the name:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America\r\n\u2022 Denali to Mt. McKinley or Mount McKinley\r\n\r\n2. The same types of records on purchase of Greenland\r\n\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2025, to the present.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Bloomberg News, assigned control number DOI-2025-003184, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the US Geological Survey's U.S. Board on Geographic Names\r\n\r\n1) All records, which includes, but is not limited to emails (including attachments), text messages, internal studies, final reports, directives, memos, letters, on changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\"\r\n\r\n2)The same types of records on changing the name of Denali to \"Mount McKinley.\"\r\n\r\n3) Emails (including attachments) of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention \"Gulf of America\"\r\n\r\n4) Emails of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention Denali or Mount McKinley.\r\n\r\nThe timeframe for this request is January 1, 2025 to the present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from WIRED, assigned control number DOI-2025-003203, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRecords dated from December 1, 2024 through the time this request is processed relating to Donald Trump's desire to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and the related executive order and in the possession of Michael Tischler, Shellie Zahniser, or Chris Hammond of the U.S. Geological Survey.  The term \u201crecords\u201d includes emails (with attachments) but also refers to other documents and items, such as text messages; invitations, communications, and chats from meeting applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams; encrypted apps such as Signal, WhatsApp, and others; phone records; calendar entries; recordings of virtual or in-person meetings; and communications on collaboration platforms such as Slack. It omits news articles and messages from listservs that distribute them unless accompanied by substantial commentary from one of the above-named people or an interlocutor.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.  We have gathered materials as potentially responsive to DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.  However, we have not yet completed a review of these records.  We will provide records in rolling releases to you in conjunction with releases issue for DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.\r\n\r\nWe classified you as an \u201cother use\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to 2 hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).  We do not anticipate any fees related to your request.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road \u2013 OGIS\r\nCollege Park, Maryland  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:     (202) 741-5770\r\nFax:                 (202) 741-5769\r\nToll-free:         1-877-684-6448\r\nE-mail:            ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nWeb:                https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of filing an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.

Please be advised that a contractor, Unity Health Care, Inc., provides health care services to DOC inmates. The information you are requesting relates to the contractor\u2019s personnel matter. It is not the kind of information that DOC creates and maintains. Under the FOIA, an agency\u2019s search obligation is limited to records or information the agency has created and/or maintained. Finally, DOC did not create and did not find the requested list.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your FOIA request, please be advised that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you may appeal to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d or \u201cFOIA Appeal\u201d in the subject line of the letter as well as on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request, (2) a copy of this letter, (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and or arguments advanced in support of disclosure, and (4) a daytime telephone number, and e-mail and/or U.S. Mail address at which you can be reached.  The appeal must be emailed to foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> or mailed to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (MOLC) at 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C. 20004. Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to me.\r\n\r\nFailure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOluwasegun Obebe\nRecords, Information & Privacy Officer\r\nDC Department of Corrections\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\n3924 Minnesota Ave, NE\r\nWashington, DC 20019\r\n(202) 671-2055 (O)\r\n(202) 538-2389 (C)\r\n(202) 671-1705 (F)\r\nSegun.obebe@dc.gov<mailto:Segun.obebe@dc.gov>\r\nwww.doc.dc.gov<http://www.doc.dc.gov/>\r\n[cid:image003.jpg@01DBDADE.CB5B3A30]",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nRequest number: 20250612-RT1\r\n\r\nWe received your request for FLOCK records. We have located responsive records for items 1, 3a and 3b. The scope of records for item 2 would be very large and creating a record that we do not have. Pursuant to per WAC 44-14-04003(6)<https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=44-14-04003>, we are not obligated to create a record in order to fulfill this request:\r\n\r\n(6) No duty to create records. An agency is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request. However, sometimes it is easier for an agency to create a record responsive to the request rather than collecting and making available voluminous records that contain small pieces of the information sought by the requestor or find itself in a controversy about whether the request requires the creation of a new record. The decision to create a new record is left to the discretion of the agency. With respect to databases, for example, there is not always a simple dichotomy between producing an existing record and creating a new record. In addition, an agency may decide to provide a customized service and if so, assess a customized service charge for the actual costs of staff technology expertise needed to prepare data compilations, or when such customized access services are not used by the agency for other business purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wish to receive the records responsive to items 1, 3a and 3b there is a fee of $3.50. I have attached the worksheet for how the fee was calculated based off the fact that necessary redactions will be applied to some documents. Please call the main line below during normal business hours Mon-Fri 8:30-4:30) to pay your fee. We will be closed tomorrow, 6/19.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive payment by 6/27/25 your request will be considered abandoned and closed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DBE033.AC1569C0]\r\nMiranda Jeter\r\nRecords Clerk\r\nBonney Lake Police Department\r\nOffice Phone (253) 863 - 2218 opt. 4\r\nFax  (253) 863 - 2661\r\n18421 Veterans Memorial Drive E.
