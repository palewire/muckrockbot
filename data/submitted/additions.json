        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny and all case files, information, data, photos, investigative notes, logs, presentations, communications, written notes, documentation, documents, official emails, any and all public outreach media or print media and any communications either to or from NCIC or WACIC (either email or teletype) about a missing man named DAVID ROBERT SAMPSON. SAMPSON went missing from the city of Seattle on March 1st of 1977. \r\n\r\nThe agency case file for this missing person request is: 84-195323. There is a NAMUS case number of: 14272. The case appears to be currently assigned to Thomas Jensen, who is retired and a volunteer with the King County Sheriff's Office cold case squad. Efforts to reach Mr. Jensen have been unsuccessful.. Two PDFs are attached related to this missing person case. \r\n\r\nI am filing this request because I believe that there is a possibility that SAMPSON could be the identity of an unidentified John Doe discovered in Kirkland in 1985. I hope that this request spurs a comparison between SAMPSON and the Kirkland John Doe, and that this request ensures that public information related to SAMPSON is available. \r\n\r\nThank you to the King County Sheriff's Office for their commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
