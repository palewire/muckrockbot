The keyword search terms that may be used to identify relevant records include: \"Arab Spring,\" \"Tunisia,\" \"Egypt,\" \"Libya,\" \"Bahrain,\" \"Yemen,\" \"Syria,\" \"protest,\" \"uprising,\" \"demonstration,\" \"interagency,\" \"coordination,\" \"communication,\" \"intelligence sharing,\" and \"information sharing.\"\r\n\r\nThis may include but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny communications between the FBI and other US government agencies, such as the CIA or Department of Homeland Security, regarding the Arab Spring\r\nAny reports or memos detailing the sharing of intelligence or information related to the Arab Spring between different government agencies\r\nAny training materials or guidelines related to interagency communication and coordination during political crises or uprisings\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
