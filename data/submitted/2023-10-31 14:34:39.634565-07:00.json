Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to the military's decision to create an energy conservation mascot in the first place. \r\n\r\nNote: According to the attached records, Brite was developed by members of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Northwest, Public Works Department in Kitsap, Washington. So please be sure to search there.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Brite-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, photographs, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Brite costume (pictured in the attached records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Brite.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Brite (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. U.S. Senator Jodi Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some responsive records. \r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by the Navy or Marine Corps to stop using Brite as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

The records you seek require a search in at least one other office within ATF, and so your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Your request has been placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing.  A tracking number has been assigned to your request and is set forth above.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request.Because this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of your request, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees.If you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390 to discuss any aspect of your request.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

Requests for information and documents under the purview of the Army are referred to the proponent agency for appropriate handling in accordance with Army Regulation 25-55, The Army Freedom of Information Act program. The FOIA only provides the means by which the public can request specific documents from the Army.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA does not require Federal agencies to respond to questions, render opinions, do legal research, compile or analyze data, or conduct surveys for members of the public.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently unperfected as you are seeking data and not specific Army documents.  Absent a request for specific Army documents, we regret we will be unable to assist you.  Please advise what specific Army documents you are seeking, as well as the Army Activity in which you seek the documents.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, per AR 25-55, requesters must include a statement regarding their willingness to pay all fees or those up to a specified amount. Please keep in mind that this is just a statement regarding your willingness to pay fees; it does not mean that you will necessarily be charged fees. You can indicate that you are only willing to pay up to a certain amount (e.g. $5.00) and request to be contacted if the estimated fees exceed that amount. Alternatively, you may also request a fee waiver or reduction in fees. However, fees must be addressed before we can move forward with your request.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you respond back to this e-mail within the next 7 calendar days with the requested clarification, as well as your willingness to pay fees, or request a fee waiver.  If we do not hear back from you we will assume you are no longer interested in your FOIA request and your request will be administratively closed.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nDA FOIA Office",
