For background, he, born in St. Louis, Missouri in November 1916 to two Albanian immigrants, Christo E. Efthim and Olga Peppo. Otherwise known as Alex Efthim or Alex, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts at Washington University in 1938 and got a Masters in Public Law from Columbia University, Masters in Public Law in 1940. He served as a U.S. Army Air Force Captain during World War II from 1943 to 1946. He was later a union organizer in St. Louis, including in favor of the OPA (Office of Price Administration), critical of Rep. Walter C. Ploeser, while part of the American Veterans Committee, Fight Inflation Committee (his organization), Congress of Industrial Organizations, and other groups in the city. He married Helen Eileen Mills in 1950 in St. Louis. He later worked as a major organizer of Mobilization of Youth, an antipoverty group in New York in the 1960s, headed the Jimmerson Houses Committee for Cooperative Living in Brooklyn and served as a consultant for the Brownsville Community Council. Before this, he was education director of the International Association of Machinists Local 397 and Hotel Trades Council in New York. He became a professor at Wayne State University in 1968 and retired in 1985, publishing articles such as \"We Care\" in Kansas: The Non-Professionals Revolt\" in The Nation in 1968 and \"Serving the U.S. Work Force: A New Constituency For Schools of Social Work\" in Journal of Education for Social Work in 1976. He was reportedly denied tenure at Wayne State University because of the high degree of \"advocacy\" in his teaching and field activity. He died on October 13, 1990. I'm hopeful that this brief biographical information will help with location of some records.\r\n\r\nPlease include \"Alexander Christopher Efthim,\" \"Alex C. Efthim,\" \"Alex Efthim\", \"Alex\" or any common abbreviations of his name in your search.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBurkely Hermann",
