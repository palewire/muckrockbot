The city or county agency will contact you concerning your request and inform you whether there are public records responsive to your request, if all or part of those public records are not disclosable to you, and the statutory basis for any denial. Information pertaining to any copying fees that may be related to obtaining copies will be provided. \nPlease Note:\u00a0 With respect to public records requests that include e-mail communications, we want to make you aware that these requests generally take longer than requests for other types of information.\u00a0 First, the City/County receives a large number of requests for email communications, not just public records requests but also related to legal proceedings.\u00a0 We rely upon our information technology agency to perform these searches and that agency runs these searches (based\u00a0 upon reasonably particular search terms as set forth by the State Public Access Counselor) in the order in which the requests are received.\u00a0 Once the email search is completed, there must also be a review of the content of the email communications to ensure that they are not only responsive to your request but also disclosable.\u00a0 Finally, disclosable email communications will be produced after this review and if we do not disclose all or part of these email communications, we will provide the statutory bases for such denials as required under the APRA. \nThe APRA requires public agencies to produce responsive and disclosable public records, should they exist, within a reasonable time based upon the circumstances.\u00a0 \u00a0Please allow the agency time to review and process your request. \nWhile there is no fixed due date for a response, if more than 30 days have passed since your last communication with the agency, feel free to contact the Public Access Counselor to check the status. \nYou may reach the Public Access Counselor at 317.327.4055 or PAC@indy.gov. \nThank you, \nCity of Indianapolis and Marion County\n",
