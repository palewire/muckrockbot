I am an independent journalist and the documents obtained through this request will be used in the course of reporting about cyber security vulnerabilities within Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
