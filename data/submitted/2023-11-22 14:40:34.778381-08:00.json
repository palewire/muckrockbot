The history of the early years of independence of Georgia is of ongoing interest to the public, and release of the requested document would further the American and Georgian public's understanding of contemporary observations of this time. In addition, I ask that this request be expedited, considering the historical importance of the document in question, and due to the fact that all the individuals mentioned in said document are now deceased. \r\n\r\nThank you for the CIA's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working towards the granting of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

But now the area I live in is changing. Investors are coming in, buying the buildings they're renting to anybody they can rent to. The rents have gone up five, six, $700. Next door to me, there's a Ukraine, Ukraine owner. Well, first thing he wanted to do was make the building into a four flat. And I told him, You'll never do it while I'm living here.  And he says to me, he says, This is America. He says, this is freedom. He says, I can do anything I want. I told them if I was a younger man, I said I would beat the hell out of you because of freedom. Freedom says I can beat you up. And I says, I would have whipped your ass so fast. But he doesn't talk to me no more. ...\"\r\n\r\nAt which point the board president laughed heartily. \r\n\r\nVideo of this event can be found on the village's board meetings archive here:\r\n<https://play.champds.com/nilesil/event/236/s/4240>\r\n\r\nA complaint was lodged regarding the behavior of the board president with the Village of Niles Community Relations Commission at their August 2nd, 2023 meeting in public comment. \r\n\r\nAudio of this meeting can be found via this FOIA:\r\n<https://www.muckrock.com/foi/niles-8224/crc-meeeting-audio-8-2023-150153/#files>\r\n\r\nCommissioner Tony Dati made this statement regarding this complaint:\r\n\r\n\"So definitely can bring it up to him, I can bring it up to him, and talk to him about it. \r\n[Another speaker: By him are you referring to the mayor?]\r\nThe whole board, mayor and board.\r\n \u2026all right we\u2019ll definitely address all this and look into all this and try to have something prepared for our next meeting. \"\r\n\r\nIn the next meeting on October 11, 2023, this complaint was not addressed as promised. \r\n\r\nTo this effect, we are requesting all communications between Commissioner Tony Dati and any member of the Village of Niles board between the date of this meeting on August 2nd, 2023 and the following meeting on October 11, 2023.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.

Flickinger, special agent for the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, during the period of 1975 through 1985. Special Agent Flickinger was tasked with investigating the claims of a convict name A. Kenneth Bankston who was serving time in Leavenworth Prison in Kansas for bank robbery. Bankston specifically claimed that a group named the \"Sons of Satan\" was perpetrating the cattle mutilations occurring in the Midwest during that period. Bankston originally contacted Ross Doyen, a Kansas state senator, with these claims. Additionally, a man named Jerome Clark began corresponding with Senator Doyen and Bankston about the claims that such a group existed. Bankston subsequently claimed that this group was also associated with individuals involved in the bombing of the \"Sterling Hall\" Army mathematics lab at the University of Wisconsin in 1970; the theft of plutonium related to the \"Karen Silkwood\" case in 1974; and that the group maintained a list of US politicians that they planned to assassinate. Federal and state law enforcement took Bankston's claims serious enough that Special Agent Flickinger corresponded with the United States District Attorney's Office in Minneapolis, Federal Judge Myles Lord, and the Warden at the Marion Penitentiary in 1975 to transfer Bankston to a minimal security facility. Special Agent Flickinger subsequently spent the next few months in 1975 officially investigating Bankston's claims. We request copies of all files and correspondence related to Donald E. Flickinger's investigation into the claims of A. Kenneth Bankston, and/or the \"Sons of Satan\" (or any other groups associated with Flickinger's investigation into Bankston's claims). We additionally request copies of all correspondence between Special Agent Flickinger,  J.
