Scholars analyze records not only for the information available on any given page, but also for the relationship between that information and information on pages surrounding it.

Please release all pages regardless of the extent of excising, even if all that remains are stationary headings or administrative markings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholdings serve no important public interest. \r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING REQUEST\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records with administrative markings and pagination included.
