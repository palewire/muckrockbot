A copy of all response(s) to FOIA #25-65 listed on the VMI FOIA Website and any subsequent records released in response to that FOIA or any follow-ups the party that submitted the FOIA may request to include any that may require a new FOIA number.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of records showing the distribution of Pell Grants by race and Gender, also by athlete and non-athlete, if the athlete information is available, for the following academic years:\r\n\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025.\r\n\r\nMy previous FOIA request included all federal funds, so if the Pell Grant information is included in that response, it is acceptable.\r\n\r\n3. A FOIA response posted on another Virginia Government site indicates that VMI received $3,832,025 in 2024 and $398,250 in 2025, totaling $4,230,275 under the Pell Initiative for Virginia (PIV). In Maj. Gen. Wins' public statement after the VMI BOV voted not to extend his contract, he identified this funding as one of his significant accomplishments, although he did not mention the Virginia Program by Name. The Virginia public records show VMI reported expending approximately $55,000 to payoff the outstanding tuition bills for some cadets (\"VMI requests $55,000 to support the payment of past-due and summer balances\"). I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets.\r\n\r\n4. Also from other Virginia documents:\r\n\r\na. \"faculty stipends to provide oversight for additional Group Study Sessions (GSS).\" - who received the stipends and what events did the oversee (by name) for all rounds of the grant\r\nb. \"Establish a CAARE Team at VMI.\" - Who are the members, and what is the team's mission? for all rounds of the grant\r\nc.  \"Financial aid to Pell eligible Virginians\" - I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets for all rounds of the grant\r\nd. \"Application Fee Waivers\" - I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets for all rounds of the grant\r\ne. \"MAC-Sponsored study events\" - what were these events, who conducted them, and any information on what the events covered as well as a cost breakbdown by event for all rounds of the grant.\r\nf. STP Scholarships -  I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets for all rounds of the grant.\r\ng. Targeted Name Purchase - records describing what this product or service is for all rounds of the grant.\r\n\r\nFor any funds paid to outside entities, the name of those entities, the amounts paid to them, and the services for which they were paid.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Documentation of my contact with the State Department circa 2002-2003 regarding my request for assistance with international child welfare concerns\r\n\r\n2. Copy of the Department's response letter sent to me in 2004 providing Hague Convention information and procedures\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Following my child's extended absence from the United States when taken by his mother and grandmother to Kilmarnock, Scotland in July 2002 - an area known for high crime rates and drug activity - I contacted the State Department seeking guidance on Hague Convention procedures for legally securing my child's return to the United States. The prolonged international absence in this location created significant concerns about my child's welfare, safety, and unknown living conditions. The Department appropriately and professionally responded with educational information about Hague Convention processes and international child welfare protections.\r\n\r\nThis request serves family documentation purposes and focuses specifically on the initial request for assistance and the Department's professional and comprehensive response providing legal guidance.\r\n\r\nFee waiver requested for personal correspondence records and family documentation research.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\n\r\nFor any document you know exists but do not have, please provide name of agency and contact information to request it from.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice publishes a newsletter in targetedjustice.substack.com. It currently has over 21,000 subscribers and over 227,000 views per month. Pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466, Targeted Justice qualifies as a member of the news media that provides information of public interest to its subscribers. Thus the information sought is not deemed for commercial use. Id. TJ's status as a member of the media warrants the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed in the endeavors of disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5 (d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nThe records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.\u201d Id.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, TJ requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2). Furthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as the TJ will report the results of this endeavor as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\n For any document you fail to produce, TJ requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at (phone number). Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nTargeted Justice\r\n281-772-2668\r\n247tj@proton.me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\n\r\nFor any document you know exists but do not have, please provide name of agency and contact information to request it from.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice publishes a newsletter in targetedjustice.substack.com. It currently has over 21,000 subscribers and over 227,000 views per month. Pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466, Targeted Justice qualifies as a member of the news media that provides information of public interest to its subscribers. Thus the information sought is not deemed for commercial use. Id. TJ's status as a member of the media warrants the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed in the endeavors of disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5 (d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nThe records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.\u201d Id.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, TJ requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2). Furthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as the TJ will report the results of this endeavor as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\n For any document you fail to produce, TJ requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at (phone number). Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nTargeted Justice\r\n281-772-2668\r\n247tj@proton.me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",

These include, without limitation, the policy and another process for cadets to take a week off (or other periods) to celebrate Ramadan, time off  and other accomodations for for Major religious holidays include those celebrated by Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others (e.g. Christmas, Easter, Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, Yom Kippur, Diwali, etc.)\r\n\r\nAcademic Years Covered:\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the schedules of these events and the guidance in terms of \"orders\" or other instructions allowing cadets to take advantage of absences from the campus, classes are more likely than not internal records, if any of these policies are publicly posted I am willing to accept links to them so they do not have to be converted to files and sent and so reduce the workload required to fill this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Due to family circumstances that led to my relocation from Connecticut in 1994, I have very limited family documentation of his career.\r\nRecords requested include:\r\n\r\n-Personnel files and employment documentation\r\n-Commendations, awards, and recognition records\r\n-Photographs, official portraits, department photos, ceremonies\r\n-Community service and public safety contributions\r\n-Retirement or end-of-service documentation\r\n-Funeral arrangements and Honor Guard ceremony records\r\n-Military honors coordination documentation\r\n\r\nFamily Background: I was named after my grandfather (middle name Thomas), reflecting our close relationship before his passing when I was 11 years old. I still remember seeing grandpa Tommy on his beat which was near the Derby Green at that time. He seemed to know everyone in town and treated everyone with the same respect. In 1988 Tommy was struck with a sudden heart attack near Derby High School while off duty and died that night at Griffon Hospital. I was outside the room when he passed. Grandpa Tommy meant a lot to me. My own son is named Justin Thomas Kashuba II. We have very limited family documentation of his police service and am seeking to preserve his law enforcement legacy. He reportedly was involved in notable cases including at least one high-profile arrest during his career. \r\n\r\nAdditional Service Honors: My grandfather received a police burial with Honor Guard and military funeral honors provided by U.S. Army personnel, reflecting his distinguished service in both military and law enforcement careers. My son and I would greatly appreciate any records related to his funeral arrangements, Honor Guard participation, military honors coordination, and ceremony documentation that may have been maintained by the department.\r\n\r\nGENEALOGICAL PURPOSE: This request serves family heritage preservation and honors his dedication to public service possibly spanning 40 years combined military and law enforcement career.\r\nFee waiver requested for family genealogical research and public servant legacy preservation.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to express in words what my grandfather Tommy meant to me. If I missed any records that you feel are appropriate please provide them at your discretion.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Kashuba",

Number of Honor Court Complaints or referrals (by source, such as cadet, faculty, staff, other, if possible) to the VMI Honor Court by academic year, race, ethnic background, and gender (further broken out by race and ethnic background), also identified as athlete or non-athlete.\r\n\r\n2. Number of the Honor Court Complaints in #1 that were investigated by the same demographic breakdown.\r\n\r\n3. Number of Honor Court Investigations in #2 that where Honor Court Charges were referred to the Superintendent for trial by the same demographic breakdown and indicated as approved for further action or disapproved by the Superintendent by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n4. Number of Cadets charged by the Honor Court whose charges were dismissed by the Superintendent based on pre-trial motions or for other reasons (with reasons if available) by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n5. Number of Cadets charged by the Honor Court who pleaded guilty to the charges by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n6. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court and found innocent by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n7. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court, Found Guilty and dismissed by the same demographic Breakdown and the time between charges and final case adjudication.\r\n\r\n8. Number of Cadets charged and tried by the Honor Court, Found Guilty, whose cases the Superintendent subsequently dismissed and allowed them to stay at VMI by the same demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n9. Number of Honor Court Cases where the Honor Court charged cadets but the Superintendent used his authority to adjudicate the case while the Corps was away from VMI (Summer Break, Furloughs, etc.) under the authority granted to him by the changes to the Honor System to make it more equitable by the exact demographic Breakdown.\r\n\r\n10. Number of Honor Court Convictions appealed to the Board of Visitors Appeals Committee, and the result (appeal granted or denied) by the same demographic breakdown.\r\n\r\nData requested for the following Academic Years\r\n\r\n2019 - 2020\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nPreviously, similar statistics were made public through the media and the Barnes and Thornburg Investigation report before the requested years. The outgoing VMI Superintendent highlighted his accomplishments in ensuring racial equity, specifically for Black cadets. Still, the VMI Board of Visitors has not released his performance data in response to questions raised regarding their decision not to renew his contract. Other public documents contain statements regarding his successful efforts to provide personal oversight, review in these areas, and offenses, and prevent biased application of disciplinary actions (particularly against Black Cadets) to ensure equity. This updated data is relevant for the public to know the impact of his involvement in these areas identified as issues in the investigation.\r\n\r\nThis request is specifically NOT requesting any Personally Identifying Information (PII) on any of the individuals involved. VMI no longer announces the names of cadets dismissed for Honor Violations and those involved in Honor Court Cases are strictly prohibited from disclosing the the identities of these cadets, so there is no situation where this general information, which it is reasonably expected must be maintained to meet the committments to equity in the One Corps, One VMI Plan, responses to the Barnes and Thornburg Report, and VMI's repeated Committment to making changes to the honor ssystem so it is more equitable woudl violated any current or former cadet's privacy.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
