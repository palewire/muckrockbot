In order of preference, I would prefer that this data be provided as: OpenDocument spreadsheet, plain text with comma-separated-values (i.e., a \"CSV\" file), Excel spreadsheet, or the native electronic format of the software from which this information is retrieved in fulfillment of my request. I specifically request that you not create a new record for me by rendering to PDF or by printing your electronic record then scanning it to make a series of images of the printed data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.  I understand merely stating that I will not be using records for commercial purposes is not sufficient, and so further details are: to use this public record to inform myself and the public at large of whom we, the people, employ to work as peace officers in the city of Spokane, what those employee's general assignments are, and how they are identified by your agency when names are not available (e.g., when one is identified only by \"badge number\").\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
