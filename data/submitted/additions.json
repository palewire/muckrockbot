ICE assigned our request 2023-ICFO-07520 and denied it by informing us that DHS is the proper custodian of these records. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/deloitte-securerelease-foia-contract-documents-138081/\r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
