Ferriero Emails, Texts, Contacts, Calendar\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply. \r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nRECORDS SOUGHT VIA FOIA. \r\n\r\nNARA 24-A.I. Muckrock. Ferriero Emails, Texts, Calendar\r\nSee PDF.\r\n\r\nSee Requested Format.\r\n\r\nFor NARA employee: \r\nFormer Archivist\r\nDavid S. Ferriero\r\ndavid.ferriero@nara.gov\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking:\r\n1.\tThe emails, contacts, texts, and calendar items. I may accept PDF with attachments and metadata). Anyone can locate and preserve these records within minutes\r\n2.\tThe file shall not be password protected such that it is able to be opened. Note that the agency should maintain the certificates for opening any encrypted files in any further proceedings.\r\n3.\tI am a private requester with no commercial interest.\r\n4.\tNotwithstanding that subject employee recently retired, the records are required to be preserved. The Honorable David S. Ferriero was sworn in as 10th Archivist of the United States on November 13, 2009.\r\n5.\tI am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record subject to FOIA that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook). by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be open ed by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n\r\nI am also seeking that this full FOIA request and responsive records be made available to the public on NARA websites.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest. \r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES. \r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. The  subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence . The Archivist is currently the subject of extraordinary media interest regarding the recovery of presidential records from Presidents Biden and Trump. \r\nAdditionally, I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution.\r\n\r\nMy FOIA request will be publicly available on Muckrock.com as will all correspondence and responsive records released.\r\n\r\nDOD POLICY \u2013 PUBLIC TRUST.  \r\n \r\nReference (c) states, \u201cDoD personnel are expected to comply with the FOIA, this Regulation, and DoD FOIA policy in both letter and spirit. This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d \r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change. See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01-agencies-must-provide-edcs \r\n\r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY.  This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default. \r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. \r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later. \r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. \r\n\r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues. \r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action  I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter.  No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data.  Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).  \r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020 \tAccess and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not paid \tTemporary. Destroy 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use. \tDAA-GRS-2016-0002-0001 \r\n\r\nALTERATION/DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\n18 U.S. CODE \u00a7 1519 - DESTRUCTION, ALTERATION, OR FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS.\r\n\r\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1519 - Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records.

See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_justice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d). \r\n12.\tAmong other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d \r\n13.\tThe DOJ Handbook also states: \r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report.  It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n\r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking. If you believe that my request is unclear, if you have any questions, or if there is anything else that you need from me to complete this request in a timely manner, please contact me in writing, so that I may perfect my request. If you deem that any portion of my request is unclear, answer the remaining portions and I will perfect a request for additional material as needed.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance. \r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\n/s/\r\nRobert Hammond\t\r\nRequester\r\nWhistleblower\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n(a)\tThe Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended,\r\n(b)\tJoint publication of U.S. Department of Justice, Executive Office of the President and U.S. General Services Administration of July 2011, \u201cYour Right to Federal Records\u201d\r\n(c)\tThe Privacy Act (\u201cPA\u201d) of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, et seq., as amended\r\n(d)\tDoD 5400.11-R, May 14, 2007, Department of Defense Privacy Program\r\n(e)\tDoD 5400.7-R, September 1998, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program\r\n(f)\tDoD 6025.18-R, Jan. 24, 2003, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation\r\n(g)\tGAO Report GAO-12-828 of July 2012, subject Freedom of Information Act\r\n(h)\tDepartment of Justice Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports\r\n(i)\t(b) Administrative Instruction 106, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program,\u201d January 30, 2014\r\n(j)\tDoD Directive 5145.01, \u201cGeneral Counsel of the Department of Defense (GC DoD),\u201d December 2, 2013, as amended \r\n(k)\t DoD Directive 5145.04, \u201cDefense Legal Services Agency (DLSA),\u201d April 16, 2012\r\n(l)\t(f) DoD Directive 5400.11, \u201cDoD Privacy Program,\u201d October 29, 2014 \r\n(m)\t DoD Manual 8910.01, Volume 1, \u201cDoD Information Collections Manual: Procedures for DoD Internal Information Collections,\u201d June 30, 2014 \r\n(n)\t Executive Order 12988, \u201cCivil Justice Reform,\u201d February 5, 1996 \r\n(o)\tPublic Law 101-552, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act,\u201d November 15, 1990 \r\n(p)\tPublic Law 104\u2013320, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996,\u201d October 19, 1996 \r\n(q)\tPresidential Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, \u201cDesignation of Interagency Committees to Facilitate and Encourage Agency Use of Alternate Means of Dispute Resolution and Negotiated Rulemaking,\u201d May 1, 1998\r\n(r)\tUnited States Code, Title 5\r\n(s)\tDoD Instruction 5145.05, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and Conflict Management\u201d\r\n(t)\tAlternate Dispute Resolution Handbook (opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/employee-rights-appeals/alternative-dispute-resolution/handbook.pdf)\r\n(u)\tPresident Obama's FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines (justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/foia-memorandum.pdf)",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\n\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\n\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.'\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3.

For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G.

The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year.

The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified. \r\n3. These emails are being requested so that I may answer questions that resulted from my direct investigation and reporting on the ILC matter to determine fairness and equitability was applied across two different but similar properties by the Cortez   City Council, staff of Cortez, and to determine whether outside influence played a part in the matters between Le Pew permitting and ILC permitting. This is very much in public interest, particularly since one party is an employee of the city and the other party is a citizen of Cortez. \r\n4. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCharles Jeter",
