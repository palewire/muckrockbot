This request includes records addressing allegations of systemic constitutional violations, ADA non-compliance, whistleblower retaliation, and associated governance issues.\r\n\r\nScope of Request\r\nComplaint Review and Processing:\r\n\r\nAll internal records, including memos, emails, meeting notes, decision logs, and evaluations, documenting the review and disposition of complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nAny workflows or internal task assignments related to this complaint, including timelines and responsible personnel.\r\nExternal and Interagency Communications:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence between DOJ and external entities, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Connecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office, and other federal or state agencies concerning the subject matter of the complaint.\r\nInteragency directives or advisories relating to oversight or collaboration on systemic issues identified in the complaint.\r\nPolicy, Procedure, and Action Records:\r\n\r\nDocumentation of DOJ protocols, policies, or operational guidelines used in assessing, addressing, or dismissing complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nRecords of enforcement actions, case follow-ups, or formal referrals stemming from the complaint.\r\nPersonnel Involvement:\r\n\r\nIdentification of all DOJ personnel involved in processing or overseeing this matter, including their roles, decision-making authority, and communication logs.\r\nLegal and Procedural Basis:\r\n\r\nAny legal analyses, internal opinions, or statutory references justifying the decision communicated to me in your letter dated December 2, 2024, indicating no further action would be taken.\r\nSupporting documentation outlining the DOJ's compliance with whistleblower protection standards, ADA obligations, and constitutional governance in this decision.\r\nADA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nAll DOJ records, policies, and communications addressing ADA accommodations or whistleblower protections as applied in this case.\r\nDocumentation of any DOJ awareness, training, or application of ADA-compliant processes related to this complaint.\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the significant public interest in transparency regarding whistleblower retaliation, ADA compliance, and constitutional violations, expedited processing is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Immediate access to these records is essential to addressing ongoing harm and systemic governance issues.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nAs this request is made in the public interest and not for commercial purposes, I request a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of these records will contribute substantially to public understanding of government operations and decision-making.\r\n\r\nDeadline and Compliance Expectations\r\nI anticipate your acknowledgment of this request within the statutory 20 business days and fulfillment of the request without undue delay. Any refusal to provide responsive records must be accompanied by a detailed justification citing specific statutory exemptions.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA obligations or provide the requested accommodations will necessitate escalation through administrative appeals, formal complaints to oversight bodies, and judicial remedies.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\nABI Resources https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf https://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\nConnecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office\r\nRelevant Congressional Oversight Committees\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am also happy to hop on the phone.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a freelance reporter writing for outlets such as WIRED, The Guardian, and Rolling Stone. As such, the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and I look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline Haskins",
