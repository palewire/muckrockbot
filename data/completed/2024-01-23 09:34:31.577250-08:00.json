Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "On December 19, the department of education sent an email regarding this request (#F22,727,FOIL-2023-040-00555) to 154445-13358908@requests.muckrock.com. That's incorrect. The correct email address is 154447-94133837@requests.muckrock.com. It appears that a responsive document was similarly shared to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the production of a single responsive document. Though it is exceptionally confusing that it was delivered to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me why this continues, I have informed the department of education multiple times that MuckRock is designed to improve the FOIL experience for citizens and records access agencies in part by assigning unique email addresses to each filed request. Sending communications about requests to addresses other than the unique email address assigned to each request obfuscates and confuses the process greatly. Please fix this. I believe this to be an honest mistake, but if it continues I will start to question that assumption. I do not wish to argue or fight over this. It's just making things unnecessarily difficult for both of us.\r\n\r\nIn the December 19 communication, the agency first quoted the DOE regulations as such:\r\n\r\n----\r\nPursuant to Section VI.C of New York City Department of Education (DOE) Chancellor\u2019s Regulation D-110 (CR D-110), factors to be considered under CR D-110 in determining whether there exist circumstances necessitating more \r\ntime to respond to a request may include, but are not limited to:\r\n\u201c[1] the volume of a request, [2] the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating records, [3] the complexity of the request, [4] the need to review records to determine the extent to which they must be disclosed, [and 5] the number of requests received by the agency.\u201d1\r\n----\r\n...and then addresses the number of requests in progress:\r\n\"With respect to factor 5, at the time you made \r\nyour request, many other FOIL requests were already pending, many of which involved multiple factors, or all the factors cited above. A response to your request is expected by January 22, 2024.\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what I am addressing. \r\n\r\nThe text of the law and the case law I have reviewed shows the agency has obvious authority to extend the time to respond to a request. This also has been shown in court to apply when agencies have numerous requests to handle.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that the agency is acknowledging awareness of factors that might reasonably delay the fulfillment of the request by December 19, 2023.\r\n\r\nAt no point prior to the deadline was the estimated completion date updated.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, I have dealt with city agencies repeating the delay of fulfillment in increments of 1-3 months for up to two years at a time. At no point did any of them provide an accurate estimation of the completion date.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that records access officers are competent at their jobs and intelligent individuals, thus it strains my sense of credulity to accept that delays are so consistently unforseen and unforeseeable to the point where completion dates must routinely and normally be extended. It has further drained my sense of patience in dealing with agencies when the obvious happens. \r\n\r\nI have no qualm with the individual records access officer about this issue. I believe they are merely stuck working with a system that undervalues FOIL, and places overworked employees in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nThat does nothing to detract from the absurdity of an agency that first understaffs the FOIL positions, initially promises completion dates that are short enough to beguile requesters (but are rarely met), and then claims a lack of foresight about the failure to meet self imposed completion dates. Surely Kafka might've mistaken it for an excerpt from his work should he be alive today!\r\n\r\nThe law requires that agencies provide: \"a date certain within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances, when the request will be granted in whole or in part\". Viewed through the isolated lens of each individual communication and interaction, it may very well appear reasonable to delay a given request by some arbitrary amount of time. Viewed in the larger picture, it is hard to conceive of the reasonableness of the situation. The majority of FOIL requests in the state are late enough to make a mockery of the intent of the freedom of information law. This is what I intend to fight when I refuse to accept extensions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven these facts, I am requesting solid and sincere confirmation that the January 22, 2024 completion date will be met.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot commit to that date with the information that is available between November 9, 2023 and now, I will appeal on the grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\nIf you commit to that date and miss it, I will appeal on the grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If that request of years is to complicated please reduce it a reasonable timeframe to the current date. \r\n\r\nI request a copy of any records/data held on all the identifiable sex offenders for years 2012 through 2023 on record for life sentences  to report at the Ohio Electronic Sex Offender Registration and Notification Database and/or at the Ohio Attorney General  and/or the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. If the request for the records/data has an  extensive timeframe you may narrow the search of the records/data of the sex offenders with life sentences to the years feasible to complete the request of FOIA and/or Privacy Act of 1974.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Ohio Supervisor of Public Record laws. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.

Secretarial Order 3244 (November 12, 2002) anchored Bureau/Office FOIA Offices within their respective CIOs' Offices. That order was superseded by Secretarial Order 3309 (December 14, 2010), which replaced Bureau/Office CIOs with Assistant Directors for Information Resources and initiated a series of significant ongoing organizational changes as part of the Department's IT Transformation. \r\nBureau/office FOIA Officers are responsible for tracking, managing and responding to FOIA requests for records in their organization's possession and control, and administering their organization's FOIA programs. In addition to Bureau/Office FOIA Officers, some bureaus/offices also have Regional FOIA Coordinators and Field Offices that process requests. Some bureaus/offices have their program offices (i.e., the offices whose records are the subject of the requests) prepare the responses to FOIA requests. These responses are reviewed by the FOIA Officer or Regional FOIA Coordinator and the appropriate FOIA attorney (when the decision is to withhold information, make a discretionary release, or deny a fee waiver).\u201d\r\n\r\n- - - > > > all staffing reports and plans for the year 2019\r\n- If reports are available for each month, such a version is preferred.\r\n\r\n- - - > > > contact information, including email addresses and phone numbers (if available), for each FOIA officer currently tasked with an open public records request\r\n\r\n***FOIA requester categories***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, the designated category of each requester of a FOIA request to this office, including those assigned to the following categories: \r\n* commercial; \r\n* educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; \r\n* representative of news media requester; \r\n* all other requesters\r\n- If this information is kept in an aggregate form including the number of requesters by fee category by year, a copy of this report will suffice to fulfill this element of the request.\r\n\r\n***FOIA fee waivers***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, the number of fee waivers granted by this office and, if available, the tracking numbers for the FOIA requests to which waivers were granted\r\n\r\n***FOIA fee collection***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, any report capturing the following information:\r\n* total estimated processing and copy fees quoted to FOIA requesters\r\n* total processing and copy fees collected by this Bureau from each fee category\r\n- If this information is kept in an aggregate form, such as a FOIA log, that material would be sufficient to satisfy the bullet points \u201cFOIA requester categories\u201d and \u201cFOIA fee collection\u201d if it captures the following information:\r\n* FOIA tracking number\r\n* requester fee category\r\n* amount processing and copy fees associated with the request\r\n* the status of the requester\u2019s payment for the request\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBeryl Lipton\n\n",

Your request was assigned to the Women's Bureau (WB) - an agency component of the Department of Labor - for processing under tracking #875982.  In your request, you asked for the following:\r\n\r\n\r\no   funding levels, staffing plans and activities of the WB FOIA office\r\n\r\nThe Women's Bureau has conducted a search of its files and finds no records responsive to your request.  Please note that WB does not have a \"FOIA Office.\"  The WB Disclosure Officer and FOIA Coordinator are not specific job titles within WB.  The responsibility for administering FOIA is a collateral duty performed by a single WB FOIA Coordinator.  Therefore, the WB has no direct staffing or budget documents specifically for FOIA.  However, the Department of Labor's Annual FOIA Report provides agency-wide collective FOIA reporting data for all DOL agency components - which may contain information responsive to your request.  The DOL Annual FOIA reports, posted publicly on the DOL Website, and can be found at:  https://www.dol.gov/dol/foia/Annual-FOIA-Reports.htm\r\n\r\nShould you require further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of this request, you may contact Cheryl Edwards, WB FOIA Coordinator/FOIA Service Center Administrator via email:  Womens.Bureau@DOL.GOV<mailto:Womens.Bureau@DOL.GOV>, or phone at 202-693-6735.  Alternatively, you may contact DOL's FOIA Public Liaison, Thomas Hicks, at 202-693-5427; or the Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration (OGIS) to inquire about mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.  You can also reach that office by email at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; by phone at 202-741-5770, by fax at 202-741-5769, or by calling toll-free at 1-877-684-6448.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Solicitor of Labor within 90 days from the date of this letter.  The appeal must state in writing the grounds for the appeal, and it may include any supporting statements or arguments, but such statements are not required. In order to facilitate processing of the appeal, please include your mailing address and daytime telephone number, as well as a copy of the initial request and copy of this letter.  The envelope and letter of the appeal should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"  Any amendment to the appeal must be made in writing and received prior to a decision.

Secretarial Order\r\n3244 (November 12, 2002) anchored Bureau/Office FOIA Offices within their respective CIOs' Offices. That\r\norder was superseded by Secretarial Order 3309 (December 14, 2010), which replaced Bureau/Office CIOs with\r\nAssistant Directors for Information Resources and initiated a series of significant ongoing organizational\r\nchanges as part of the Department's IT Transformation.\r\nBureau/office FOIA Officers are responsible for tracking, managing and responding to FOIA requests for\r\nrecords in their organization's possession and control, and administering their organization's FOIA programs. In\r\naddition to Bureau/Office FOIA Officers, some bureaus/offices also have Regional FOIA Coordinators and\r\nField Offices that process requests. Some bureaus/offices have their program offices (i.e., the offices whose\r\nrecords are the subject of the requests) prepare the responses to FOIA requests. These responses are reviewed\r\nby the FOIA Officer or Regional FOIA Coordinator and the appropriate FOIA attorney (when the decision is to\r\nwithhold information, make a discretionary release, or deny a fee waiver).\"\r\n\r\n- - - > > > all staffing reports and plans for the year 2019\r\n- If reports are available for each month, such a version is preferred.\r\n\r\n- - - > > > contact information, including email addresses and phone numbers (if available), for each FOIA\r\nofficer currently tasked with an open public records request\r\n2\r\n***FOIA requester categories***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, the designated category of each requester of a FOIA request to this\r\noffice, including those assigned to the following categories:\r\n* commercial;\r\n* educational and noncommercial scientific institutions;\r\n* representative of news media requester;\r\n* all other requesters\r\n- If this information is kept in an aggregate form including the number of requesters by fee category by year, a\r\ncopy of this report will suffice to fulfill this element of the request.\r\n\r\n***FOIA fee waivers***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, the number of fee waivers granted by this office and, if available, the\r\ntracking numbers for the FOIA requests to which waivers were granted\r\n\r\n***FOIA fee collection***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, any report capturing the following information:\r\n* total estimated processing and copy fees quoted to FOIA requesters\r\n* total processing and copy fees collected by this Bureau from each fee category\r\n- If this information is kept in an aggregate form, such as a FOIA log, that material would be sufficient to satisfy\r\nthe bullet points \"FOIA requester categories\" and \"FOIA fee collection\" if it captures the following\r\ninformation:\r\n* FOIA tracking number\r\n* requester fee category\r\n* amount processing and copy fees associated with the request\r\n* the status of the requester's payment for the request\r\n\r\nYour request was assigned FOIA tracking number 875982.  Unfortunately, your request has not been processed due to a large backlog.  Therefore, we would like to know if you are still interested in receiving the documents you requested.\r\n\r\nPlease respond in writing within 30 business days from the date of this letter if you would like to withdraw your request or if you are still interested.  If we do not hear from you within the time period requested, your request will be administratively closed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter you may contact the WHD National Office as follows:\r\n\r\nEmail: WHD-FOIA@dol.gov<mailto:WHD-FOIA@dol.gov>\r\nTelephone: 202-693-1004\nFax: 202-693-0637\r\n\r\nMail: U.

Sincerely, Katherine Arntz \r\nJackson County Office of the Sheriff FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (EXCERPT) \r\nAct 442 of 1976 15.240.amended Options by requesting person; appeal; actions by public body; receipt of written appeal; judicial review; civil action; venue; de novo proceeding; burden of proof; private view of public record; contempt; assignment of action or appeal for hearing, trial, or argument; attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements; assessment of award; damages. \r\nSec. 10. \r\n(1) If a public body makes a final determination to deny all or a portion of a request, the requesting person may do 1 of the following at his or her option: \r\n(a) Submit to the head of the public body a written appeal that specifically states the word \"appeal\" and identifies the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial. \r\n(b) Commence a civil action in the circuit court, or if the decision of a state public body is at issue, the court of claims, to compel the public body's disclosure of the public records within 180 days after a public body's final determination to deny a request. \r\n(2) Within 10 business days after receiving a written appeal pursuant to subsection (1)(a), the head of a public body shall do 1 of the following: \r\n(a) Reverse the disclosure denial. \r\n(b) Issue a written notice to the requesting person upholding the disclosure denial. \r\n(c) Reverse the disclosure denial in part and issue a written notice to the requesting person upholding the disclosure denial in part. \r\n(d) Under unusual circumstances, issue a notice extending for not more than 10 business days the period during which the head of the public body shall respond to the written appeal. The head of a public body shall not issue more than 1 notice of extension for a particular written appeal. \r\n(3) A board or commission that is the head of a public body is not considered to have received a written appeal under subsection (2) until the first regularly scheduled meeting of that board or commission following submission of the written appeal under subsection (1)(a). If the head of the public body fails to respond to a written appeal pursuant to subsection (2), or if the head of the public body upholds all or a portion of the disclosure denial that is the subject of the written appeal, the requesting person may seek judicial review of the nondisclosure by commencing a civil action under subsection (1)(b). \r\n(4) In an action commenced under subsection (1)(b), a court that determines a public record is not exempt from disclosure shall order the public body to cease withholding or to produce all or a portion of a public record wrongfully withheld, regardless of the location of the public record. Venue for an action against a local public body is proper in the circuit court for the county in which the public record or an office of the public body is located has venue over the action. The court shall determine the matter de novo and the burden is on the public body to sustain its denial. The court, on its own motion, may view the public record in controversy in private before reaching a decision. Failure to comply with an order of the court may be punished as contempt of court. \r\n(5) An action commenced under this section and an appeal from an action commenced under this section shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way. \r\n(6) If a person asserting the right to inspect, copy, or receive a copy of all or a portion of a public record prevails in an action commenced under this section, the court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements. If the person or public body prevails in part, the court may, in its discretion, award all or an appropriate portion of reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements. The award shall be assessed against the public body liable for damages under subsection (7). \r\n(7) If the court determines in an action commenced under this section that the public body has arbitrarily and capriciously violated this act by refusal or delay in disclosing or providing copies of a public record, the court shall order the public body to pay a civil fine of $1,000.00, which shall be deposited into the general fund of the state treasury. The court shall award, in addition to any actual or compensatory damages, punitive damages in the amount of $1,000.00 to the person seeking the right to inspect or receive a copy of a public record. The damages shall not be assessed against an individual, but shall be assessed against the next succeeding public body that is not an individual and that kept or maintained the public record as part of its public function.

Sincerely, Katherine Arntz \r\nJackson County Office of the Sheriff FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (EXCERPT) \r\nAct 442 of 1976 15.240.amended Options by requesting person; appeal; actions by public body; receipt of written appeal; judicial review; civil action; venue; de novo proceeding; burden of proof; private view of public record; contempt; assignment of action or appeal for hearing, trial, or argument; attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements; assessment of award; damages. \r\nSec. 10. \r\n(1) If a public body makes a final determination to deny all or a portion of a request, the requesting person may do 1 of the following at his or her option: \r\n(a) Submit to the head of the public body a written appeal that specifically states the word \"appeal\" and identifies the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial. \r\n(b) Commence a civil action in the circuit court, or if the decision of a state public body is at issue, the court of claims, to compel the public body's disclosure of the public records within 180 days after a public body's final determination to deny a request. \r\n(2) Within 10 business days after receiving a written appeal pursuant to subsection (1)(a), the head of a public body shall do 1 of the following: \r\n(a) Reverse the disclosure denial. \r\n(b) Issue a written notice to the requesting person upholding the disclosure denial. \r\n(c) Reverse the disclosure denial in part and issue a written notice to the requesting person upholding the disclosure denial in part. \r\n(d) Under unusual circumstances, issue a notice extending for not more than 10 business days the period during which the head of the public body shall respond to the written appeal. The head of a public body shall not issue more than 1 notice of extension for a particular written appeal. \r\n(3) A board or commission that is the head of a public body is not considered to have received a written appeal under subsection (2) until the first regularly scheduled meeting of that board or commission following submission of the written appeal under subsection (1)(a). If the head of the public body fails to respond to a written appeal pursuant to subsection (2), or if the head of the public body upholds all or a portion of the disclosure denial that is the subject of the written appeal, the requesting person may seek judicial review of the nondisclosure by commencing a civil action under subsection (1)(b). \r\n(4) In an action commenced under subsection (1)(b), a court that determines a public record is not exempt from disclosure shall order the public body to cease withholding or to produce all or a portion of a public record wrongfully withheld, regardless of the location of the public record. Venue for an action against a local public body is proper in the circuit court for the county in which the public record or an office of the public body is located has venue over the action. The court shall determine the matter de novo and the burden is on the public body to sustain its denial. The court, on its own motion, may view the public record in controversy in private before reaching a decision. Failure to comply with an order of the court may be punished as contempt of court. \r\n(5) An action commenced under this section and an appeal from an action commenced under this section shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way. \r\n(6) If a person asserting the right to inspect, copy, or receive a copy of all or a portion of a public record prevails in an action commenced under this section, the court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements. If the person or public body prevails in part, the court may, in its discretion, award all or an appropriate portion of reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements. The award shall be assessed against the public body liable for damages under subsection (7). \r\n(7) If the court determines in an action commenced under this section that the public body has arbitrarily and capriciously violated this act by refusal or delay in disclosing or providing copies of a public record, the court shall order the public body to pay a civil fine of $1,000.00, which shall be deposited into the general fund of the state treasury. The court shall award, in addition to any actual or compensatory damages, punitive damages in the amount of $1,000.00 to the person seeking the right to inspect or receive a copy of a public record. The damages shall not be assessed against an individual, but shall be assessed against the next succeeding public body that is not an individual and that kept or maintained the public record as part of its public function.

Further, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\"TBI\") is not the appropriate custodian of records for documents such as blue prints, design schemes, etc., and we suggest contacting the Tennessee Department of General Services for these types of documents.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the request is overly broad, based on the information provided, it is our understanding you may be seeking documents from the TBI Training Division wherein information has been requested and provided related to TBI's needs and use of the facility for its training purposes.  If this is accurate, we estimate a cost of $20 and anticipate records will be available by November 10, 2023.  Please confirm if you agree to this estimate and we will move forward with your request.\r\n\r\nIn the event we have misinterpreted your request, please provide additional information to assist in the identification of the requested records.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR EMAIL ADDRESS HAS CHANGED\r\nNEW ADDRESS: TBI.PUBLICRECORDS@TBI.TN.GOV\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[image001.jpg]\r\nTennessee Bureau of Investigation\r\nPublic Records Request Coordinator\r\nProfessional Standards Unit\r\n901 R.S.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Redactions have been made to mask information exempt from section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

Contents of emails and attachments highlighted on attached email log released via FOIA N014444-110523. RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . \r\nUnder the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been excluded, private email addresses, names of position candidates, and other private family information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

        "communication": "Dear Emma Best:\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\r\nof August 6, 2020, for records in the custody of the National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration. Your request was received in this office on August\r\n6, 2020, and assigned FOIA tracking number 64331, interim tracking number\r\nRF-178. You also requested a waiver for reproduction fees ordinarily\r\ncharged to researchers.\r\n\r\nRecords transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from\r\nthe fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because\r\na fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section\r\nstates that \u201cnothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable\r\nunder a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for\r\nparticular types of records\u201d (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee\r\nstatute authorizes the National Archives \u201cto charge a fee for making or\r\nauthenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the\r\nArchivist\u2019s custody.\u201d (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the\r\nrequested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the\r\nFreedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to FBI case files 89-HQ-4105 and 9-HQ-58661.\r\n\r\nCase file 89-HQ-4105 on Gale Edward Timberlake and C.A. Schmick was created\r\non August 15, 1977 and consists of 10 pages.\r\n\r\nCase file 9-HQ-58661 on Charles Felts and Judge George H. Boldt was created\r\nbetween November 1974 and August 1977, and consists of an estimated 200\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA (https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine).\r\n\r\nYour request does not exceed 700 pages, so it is assigned to our first-tier\r\nprocessing queue. Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we\r\nestimate it will take 39 months to complete processing.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $168.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed. To change your contact\r\ninformation or to track the status of your request, please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov or call 301-837-3190. Please include your FOIA\r\ntracking number in all communications concerning this request.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request and would like the\r\nopportunity to discuss our response, you may contact our FOIA Public\r\nLiaison for assistance:\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Records \u2013 Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Requester Service Center: 301-837-3190\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison: Michael Marquis\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\ndc.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n301-837-3190\r\n\r\nIf you have other questions regarding your request, please contact me\r\ndirectly.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nStephanie Coon\r\nArchivist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program (RF)\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nstephanie.coon@nara.gov\r\n\r\n301-837-1604\r\n\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/foia",

Office of the Governor v. Engelkemier, 148 A.3d 522, 530 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). A request must identify the subject matter, the scope, and the timeframe of the records sought.  You provided a time frame of the records you are seeking.  However, your request has no defined group of individuals whose records are to be searched nor does it identify any subject matter, but states that you are seeking \"[c]opies of all 'change requests' or reasonably similar correspondence\" which does not indicate some business of the agency and would likely lead to a broad universe of responsive records. Therefore, your request is insufficiently specific.\r\n\r\nIn order for the department to process your request, please identify a subject matter of the communications regarding \"change requests\" you are seeking.  The subject matter of the request must identify the 'transaction or activity' of the agency for which the record is sought.  Please also identify the specific people at the department (or a group, such as senior staff) that may have sent or received the communications you are seeking.\r\n\r\nYour prompt response will be appreciated so that the department can continue working on your request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAndrea Bankes | Agency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Administration\r\nDepartment of Human Services\r\nRoom 234 Health & Welfare Building | Hbg PA 17120\r\nPhone: 717.787.3422 | Fax: 717.772.2490\r\nwww.dhs.pa.gov<http://www.dhs.pa.gov/>\r\n\r\nCreating partnerships to deliver quality services to customers through collaboration, consultation and supports.\n",
