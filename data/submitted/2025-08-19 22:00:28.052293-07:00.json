        "communication": "LAKE WASHINGTON SCHOOL DISTRICT (2025) - Digital Copies of Internet Video Call Recordings - January 1, 2020 through August 19, 2025\r\n\r\n08-19-2025\r\n\r\nvia email: PublicRecordsRequest@lwsd.org\r\n\r\nTo: Public Records Officer\r\n\r\nLake Washington School District\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act (RCW 42.56), I hereby request disclosure of the following public records:\r\n\r\nDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, classroom sessions, and any other recorded internet-based communications created, received, or maintained by the District in its care, custody, or control between January 1, 2020 and August 19, 2025\r\n\r\nThis includes, but is not limited to, digital recordings generated by or through: \r\n\r\nZoom\r\nMicrosoft Teams\r\nSkype\r\nGoogle Meet\r\nGoogle Classroom\r\nGoogle Duo (now Google Meet mobile)\r\nSlack\r\nGoToMeeting / GoToWebinar\r\nWebex (Cisco)\r\nRingCentral\r\nBlueJeans (Verizon)\r\n\r\nApple technology (e.g., FaceTime, iMessage video calls, Apple Classroom, Apple School Manager, Apple Remote Learning tools)\r\n\r\nOther comparable platforms in current or past use, such as Zoom for Education, Blackboard Collaborate, Canvas Conferences, Schoology, Clever, Edmodo, Seesaw, Nearpod, Kahoot video, Flip (formerly Flipgrid), or any other system adopted for remote learning, instructional delivery, parent engagement, training, or administrative communications.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\n\r\nThe District\u2019s search should include, at a minimum:\r\n\r\nDistrict-controlled systems and servers \u2013 including cloud-based storage, internal file shares, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, or other platforms used by your agenc.\r\n\r\nDistrict-owned devices \u2013 all computers, laptops, tablets, or phones issued by LWSD that may contain responsive recordings.\r\n\r\nEmployee-controlled devices/accounts \u2013 if responsive recordings were created, stored, or retained on personal devices/accounts while conducting District business or using District-issued equipment, those devices/accounts must also be searched consistent with Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nNISSEN AFFIDAVIT AND ALL DEVICE SEARCH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nPursuant to Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015), and its progeny, this request specifically includes all responsive public records contained on personal devices or personal accounts (including personal cell phones, text/SMS/MMS, personal email accounts, cloud storage, instant messaging apps, and social media accounts) of any agency employee, official, or contractor where public business may have been conducted.\r\n\r\nTo comply with this requirement, please:\r\n\r\nConduct a comprehensive all-device search, including both agency-issued and personally owned devices/accounts used for public business.\r\n\r\nRequire each potentially responsive custodian to execute a Nissen affidavit or sworn certification affirming:\r\n\r\nThat they conducted a diligent search of all personal and agency devices/accounts reasonably likely to contain responsive records;\r\n\r\nThe methods used to conduct the search (e.g., search terms, accounts checked, device types); and\r\n\r\nWhether any responsive records were located, preserved, and produced.\r\n\r\nProduce all responsive records located in such searches along with the executed affidavits.\r\n\r\nFailure to obtain and provide sworn Nissen affidavits or equivalent certifications from custodians may constitute an incomplete search in violation of RCW 42.56.520 (requirement for a reasonable and adequate search) and may expose the agency to relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide the video recordings in their original, native digital format (e.g., .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .wmv, .webm, or platform-native format).\r\n\r\nFiles should be delivered unedited and uncut, preserving all metadata (timestamps, file properties, source identifiers).\r\n\r\nDeliver the records by direct electronic means: either (a) direct email attachment where feasible, or (b) a direct, no-password, no-registration-required download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL COMPRESSION AND FILE MINIMIZATION REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.080(2), please provide all responsive electronic records in the fewest number of individual files, preserving native formats wherever possible. Where appropriate, please use free digital compression (.zip or equivalent) to consolidate responsive records into the smallest number of installments for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nThis approach reduces agency burden, promotes prompt disclosure, and minimizes potential costs to the requestor, consistent with the Public Records Act\u2019s directive that agencies provide records in the most \u201creasonably locatable form\u201d and \u201cfullest assistance to requestors.\u201d See RCW 42.56.100 (agency duty to adopt reasonable rules for providing fullest assistance); RCW 42.56.120(2)(b) (fees must reflect actual costs, not used to discourage access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently held that agencies must facilitate access in a practical, non-burdensome manner. See Fisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (agencies must provide records in a usable format when reasonably feasible); Mechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure). Producing consolidated, digitally compressed files satisfies these obligations by reducing unnecessary fragmentation and excess per-page charges.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that each installment be produced as a single compressed .zip file (or as few as technically necessary), containing all responsive records in native format, to ensure both compliance with RCW 42.56 and an economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY PORTALS NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, use of a third-party \u201cportal\u201d is not mandatory for requestors. Agencies may not condition access to records on the creation of an account, the use of a login, or the acceptance of third-party vendor terms.\r\n\r\nThird-party portals (such as GovQA, NextRequest, JustFOIA, or similar systems) often:\r\n\r\nRequire account creation or login credentials;\r\n\r\nRestrict downloads, viewing times, or re-access;\r\n\r\nRemove or disable links after a limited period;\r\n\r\nPlace records behind commercial platforms operated by for-profit corporations.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully burden and condition access to public records. The Public Records Act forbids agencies from imposing access barriers beyond those authorized by statute.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): An agency \u201cshall not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is overbroad.\u201d Agencies must provide the \u201cfullest assistance\u201d and \u201cmost timely possible action\u201d to requestors.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.550(1): Courts are directed to liberally construe the PRA to ensure access and strictly construe exemptions against withholding.\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014): Agencies must produce records in a \u201creasonably usable format when feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and cannot be restricted by agency practices.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I respectfully decline use of any third-party portal. Please provide all responsive records via:\r\n\r\nDirect electronic email attachment to this requestor\u2019s address, or\r\n\r\nA direct, open (no password, no registration required) cloud-based download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION ON THIRD PARTY VENDORS\r\n\r\nDo not register this requestor with, nor direct this requestor to, any third-party commercial portal, including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA (a Granicus Corporation), NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA, FOIADirect, or any similar online service.\r\n\r\nDo not transmit any portion of this request, or responsive records, to any for-profit vendor or portal. Doing so would unlawfully condition access to public records and contravene both RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being submitted via email, consistent with Washington\u2019s Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\u201cAgencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency\u2019s normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency-provided form or web page.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nA request submitted by email is a valid, enforceable method of making a PRA request.\r\n\r\nAgencies may recommend, but cannot require, the use of an online portal or official form.\r\n\r\nAny refusal to honor this request as submitted would directly conflict with RCW 42.56.080 and the agency\u2019s duty under RCW 42.56.100 to provide the \u201cfullest assistance to requestors\u201d and adopt reasonable rules that do not \u201cunreasonably hinder or delay\u201d access.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the PRA must be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and access, and that agencies cannot impose unauthorized barriers:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (\u201cThe PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d).\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (records must be produced in a reasonably usable format when feasible).\r\n\r\nNissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 875 (2015) (the PRA is to be interpreted liberally to promote access and accountability).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this request is to be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email, as submitted. Should the agency fail to process this request in compliance with statute, relief will be sought pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 in the form of judicial review, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log.\r\n\r\nThe log must:\r\n\r\n* Identify the valid legal reason (statutory citation) for each exemption;\r\n* Specify the location of each redaction within the record produced (via footnote, coded reference, or margin notation);\r\n* State the number of pages or records withheld in their entirety, if any; and\r\n* Demonstrate that only the **minimal exempt portion** of any record has been withheld, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Public Records Act requires agencies to justify each withholding or redaction:\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.210(3): \u201cAgency responses refusing, in whole or in part, inspection of any public record shall include a statement of the specific exemption authorizing the withholding of the record (or part) and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.\u201d\r\nRCW 42.56.210(1): Exemptions must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have repeatedly enforced this duty:\r\n\r\nRental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 538 (2009): Agencies must provide specific explanations for each exemption; conclusory or vague justifications are insufficient.\r\nSanders v. State*, 169 Wn.2d 827, 845 (2010): \u201cThe burden of proof is on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute.\u201d\r\nResident Action Council v. Seattle Housing Auth.* 177 Wn.2d 417, 433 (2013): Agencies must disclose the non-exempt portions*of records and cannot withhold more than necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that your agency provide an itemized exemption log with each installment of records produced, in compliance with RCW 42.56.210(3) and the above case law, ensuring transparency and accountability in the redaction process.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose. The Washington State Public Records Act (PRA) prohibits agencies from disclosing \u201clists of individuals\u201d for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) states:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nThis request does not seek a \u201clist of individuals.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56.070(8) regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWarning: The PRA does not authorize agencies to require requestors to complete additional \u201ccommercial purpose declarations\u201d when the request does not seek a list of individuals. Such requirements improperly condition access to public records in violation of RCW 42.56.080(2) (requests must be honored by mail or email, no official format required) and RCW 42.56.100 (agencies must provide the fullest assistance to requestors and may not adopt rules that unreasonably hinder or delay access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently rejected agency attempts to impose conditions not found in statute:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): The PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure; agencies cannot erect unauthorized barriers.\r\n\r\nSEIU 925 v. University of Washington, 193 Wn.2d 860, 875 (2019): The PRA is to be liberally construed to promote access, and exemptions must be narrowly applied.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this request. Any attempt to impose such a requirement would be an unlawful restriction of rights under RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 (Retention of Public Records) makes clear that public records are subject to retention schedules, and that unlawful destruction can constitute a crime.\r\n\r\nRCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020 criminalize the unlawful mutilation, destruction, or concealment of public records.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.100 expressly prohibits an agency from destroying any public record after a public records request has been made for that record, even if the record would otherwise be scheduled for lawful destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, agencies have heightened retention obligations when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Records potentially relevant to actual or anticipated litigation must be preserved until both the public records request and the litigation have been fully resolved.\r\n\r\nLegal Consequences of Premature Destruction\r\n\r\nIn Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that an agency violates the Public Records Act and is subject to attorneys\u2019 fees and statutory penalties when it destroys responsive records after receiving a public records request.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is not a PRA violation if a record was destroyed prior to the agency\u2019s receipt of a request, provided the destruction was lawful under retention schedules. See Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) and the state\u2019s records retention laws (RCW 40.14) are separate but complementary. Agencies must comply with both.\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nYour agency must preserve all potentially responsive records immediately upon receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nNo responsive records may be altered, deleted, or destroyed until this request has been fully resolved and any related litigation has been lifted.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful destruction of responsive records may expose the agency and its officials to criminal liability (RCW 40.16), civil penalties, and mandatory attorneys\u2019 fees (RCW 42.56.550(4)).\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "08-19-2025\r\n\r\nLAKE WASHINGTON SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2025) Request for all communications between district employees and representatives of JUSTFOIA.com a CivicPlus company \r\n\r\nVia email: PublicRecordsRequest@lwsd.org\r\n\r\nDear Public Records Officer:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\n1) Records Requested (Scope)\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cwritings\u201d (as those terms are broadly defined in RCW 42.56.010) reflecting communications between any employee, agent, contractor, or representative of Lake Washington School District  and any employee, agent, contractor, or representative of:\r\n\r\nJustFOIA (also appears as JustFOIA.com), and/or\r\n\r\nCivicPlus (the parent company of JustFOIA).\r\n\r\nTimeframe: January 1, 2019 through the date you conduct the final search.\r\n\r\nCustodians/Locations (non-exhaustive): District leadership; Public Records/Legal; IT/IS; Finance/Procurement; Communications; any program offices that used JustFOIA; and any shared mailboxes (e.g., publicrecordsrequest@lwsd.org\r\n), Teams/Slack/Google Chat spaces, and vendor portals.\r\n\r\n1.a Types of communications (include all formats)\r\n\r\nEmail (including headers, message bodies, inline images, and attachments).\r\n\r\nText/SMS/MMS (including iMessage, Android, carrier SMS).\r\n\r\nInstant messaging & collaboration: Microsoft Teams/Skype, Slack, Google Chat, Zoom/Zoom Chat, Webex, RingCentral, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, etc.\r\n\r\nJustFOIA/CivicPlus portals: messages, comments, internal/external notes, status updates, ticket threads, and support cases.\r\n\r\nHelpdesk/ITSM tickets involving JustFOIA/CivicPlus (ServiceNow, Zendesk, Freshservice, Jira, etc.).\r\n\r\nCalendars/Invites (meeting requests, agendas, minutes, chat during meetings).\r\n\r\nVoicemail logs/transcripts/recordings and call logs (if used for vendor contact).\r\n\r\nFile shares & cloud drives that contain such communications (SharePoint/OneDrive/Google Drive/Box/Dropbox).\r\n\r\nLetters, memos, meeting notes, handouts, and presentations exchanged with JustFOIA/CivicPlus.\r\n\r\n1.b Related records about those communications\r\n\r\nContracts/agreements, SOWs, amendments, quotes, order forms, renewals, NDAs, and procurement/sole-source justifications related to JustFOIA/CivicPlus.\r\n\r\nInvoices, purchase orders, payment records, and W-9s.\r\n\r\nImplementation and configuration communications: onboarding, data migration, retention rules, security settings, user provisioning, SSO, role/permission matrices.\r\n\r\nTraining materials (agendas, sign-ins, slide decks, recordings) and policies/SOPs referencing JustFOIA.\r\n\r\nSecurity/Privacy: DPAs, BAAs (if any), SOC/ISO reports provided by vendor, questionnaires, risk assessments, incident notices, breach notifications, or vulnerability communications.\r\n\r\nChange requests, enhancement requests, bug reports, downtime/outage notices, maintenance windows.\r\n\r\nUsage, audit, and access logs showing communications within the JustFOIA system (e.g., message timestamps, sender/recipient identifiers, ticket comments).\r\n\r\nLitigation hold or preservation notices relating to these communications.\r\n\r\n2) Electronic Production & Formats\r\n\r\nTo preserve metadata and ease review, please produce as follows:\r\n\r\nEmails: PST ( Microsoft Outlook ) or MBOX containers; if unavailable, EML/MSG with full headers.\r\n\r\nChats/Texts/IM: native exports where supported; otherwise, CSV/JSON with fields for sender, recipients, timestamps (UTC), message/thread IDs, and attachments (export attachments in original formats).\r\n\r\nCalendars: ICS where possible; or PDF plus any attachments.\r\n\r\nDocuments/attachments: original/native formats (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, etc.).\r\n\r\nLogs/Reports: CSV/JSON preferred.\r\n\r\nDelivery: Direct electronic transmission via email attachments or open (no login/registration/password) download link hosted by your agency (e.g., SharePoint/OneDrive public link). Please do not use third-party portals that require creating an account or logging in. A single or series of .zip files is fine.\r\n\r\nIf any records cannot be produced in the above formats, please produce them in their native format with associated metadata intact.\r\n\r\n3) Metadata Requested\r\n\r\nWhere reasonably available, please include customary metadata fields such as: From, To, CC, BCC, Subject, Sent/Received Date-Time (with timezone/UTC), Message-ID, Conversation/Thread-ID, file names, file sizes, hash values (if held), and folder/location paths.\r\n\r\n4) Search Details & Preservation\r\n\r\nPlease identify the systems searched (Exchange/Outlook/Office 365, Teams, mobile devices, MDM archives, JustFOIA/CivicPlus admin, helpdesk, file shares) and the custodians.\r\n\r\nPlease describe the search methods/terms used.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive sources were not searched or are no longer available, please explain why and what preservation steps were taken.\r\n\r\n5) Withholding, Redaction, and Exemptions\r\n\r\nIf you withhold or redact anything, identify the specific exemption under RCW 42.56 and provide a brief written explanation of how it applies to each withheld/redacted portion (RCW 42.56.210(3)). Please produce all segregable portions. For any records withheld in full, please provide an exemption/withholding log describing: date, author/recipient (to the extent disclosable), subject or general description, format, page count, and the precise exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\n6) Installments & Estimates\r\n\r\nPlease provide:\r\n\r\nAn initial acknowledgment within five business days (RCW 42.56.520) with a reasonable time estimate for each installment, and\r\n\r\nA cost estimate if fees are anticipated (please itemize and explain).\r\n\r\nNISSEN AFFIDAVIT AND ALL DEVICE SEARCH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nPursuant to Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015), and its progeny, this request specifically includes all responsive public records contained on personal devices or personal accounts (including personal cell phones, text/SMS/MMS, personal email accounts, cloud storage, instant messaging apps, and social media accounts) of any agency employee, official, or contractor where public business may have been conducted.\r\n\r\nTo comply with this requirement, please:\r\n\r\nConduct a comprehensive all-device search, including both agency-issued and personally owned devices/accounts used for public business.\r\n\r\nRequire each potentially responsive custodian to execute a Nissen affidavit or sworn certification affirming:\r\n\r\nThat they conducted a diligent search of all personal and agency devices/accounts reasonably likely to contain responsive records;\r\n\r\nThe methods used to conduct the search (e.g., search terms, accounts checked, device types); and\r\n\r\nWhether any responsive records were located, preserved, and produced.\r\n\r\nProduce all responsive records located in such searches along with the executed affidavits.\r\n\r\nFailure to obtain and provide sworn Nissen affidavits or equivalent certifications from custodians may constitute an incomplete search in violation of RCW 42.56.520 (requirement for a reasonable and adequate search) and may expose the agency to relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL COMPRESSION AND FILE MINIMIZATION REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.080(2), please provide all responsive electronic records in the fewest number of individual files, preserving native formats wherever possible. Where appropriate, please use free digital compression (.zip or equivalent) to consolidate responsive records into the smallest number of installments for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nThis approach reduces agency burden, promotes prompt disclosure, and minimizes potential costs to the requestor, consistent with the Public Records Act\u2019s directive that agencies provide records in the most \u201creasonably locatable form\u201d and \u201cfullest assistance to requestors.\u201d See RCW 42.56.100 (agency duty to adopt reasonable rules for providing fullest assistance); RCW 42.56.120(2)(b) (fees must reflect actual costs, not used to discourage access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently held that agencies must facilitate access in a practical, non-burdensome manner. See Fisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (agencies must provide records in a usable format when reasonably feasible); Mechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure). Producing consolidated, digitally compressed files satisfies these obligations by reducing unnecessary fragmentation and excess per-page charges.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that each installment be produced as a single compressed .zip file (or as few as technically necessary), containing all responsive records in native format, to ensure both compliance with RCW 42.56 and an economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY PORTALS NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, use of a third-party \u201cportal\u201d is not mandatory for requestors. Agencies may not condition access to records on the creation of an account, the use of a login, or the acceptance of third-party vendor terms.\r\n\r\nThird-party portals (such as GovQA, NextRequest, JustFOIA, or similar systems) often:\r\n\r\nRequire account creation or login credentials;\r\n\r\nRestrict downloads, viewing times, or re-access;\r\n\r\nRemove or disable links after a limited period;\r\n\r\nPlace records behind commercial platforms operated by for-profit corporations.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully burden and condition access to public records. The Public Records Act forbids agencies from imposing access barriers beyond those authorized by statute.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): An agency \u201cshall not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is overbroad.\u201d Agencies must provide the \u201cfullest assistance\u201d and \u201cmost timely possible action\u201d to requestors.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.550(1): Courts are directed to liberally construe the PRA to ensure access and strictly construe exemptions against withholding.\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014): Agencies must produce records in a \u201creasonably usable format when feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and cannot be restricted by agency practices.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I respectfully decline use of any third-party portal. Please provide all responsive records via:\r\n\r\nDirect electronic email attachment to this requestor\u2019s address, or\r\n\r\nA direct, open (no password, no registration required) cloud-based download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION ON THIRD PARTY VENDORS\r\n\r\nDo not register this requestor with, nor direct this requestor to, any third-party commercial portal, including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA (a Granicus Corporation), NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA, FOIADirect, or any similar online service.\r\n\r\nDo not transmit any portion of this request, or responsive records, to any for-profit vendor or portal. Doing so would unlawfully condition access to public records and contravene both RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being submitted via email, consistent with Washington\u2019s Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\u201cAgencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency\u2019s normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency-provided form or web page.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nA request submitted by email is a valid, enforceable method of making a PRA request.\r\n\r\nAgencies may recommend, but cannot require, the use of an online portal or official form.\r\n\r\nAny refusal to honor this request as submitted would directly conflict with RCW 42.56.080 and the agency\u2019s duty under RCW 42.56.100 to provide the \u201cfullest assistance to requestors\u201d and adopt reasonable rules that do not \u201cunreasonably hinder or delay\u201d access.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the PRA must be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and access, and that agencies cannot impose unauthorized barriers:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (\u201cThe PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d).\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (records must be produced in a reasonably usable format when feasible).\r\n\r\nNissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 875 (2015) (the PRA is to be interpreted liberally to promote access and accountability).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this request is to be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email, as submitted. Should the agency fail to process this request in compliance with statute, relief will be sought pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 in the form of judicial review, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log. \r\n\r\nThe log must:\r\n\r\n* Identify the valid legal reason (statutory citation) for each exemption;\r\n* Specify the location of each redaction within the record produced (via footnote, coded reference, or margin notation);\r\n* State the number of pages or records withheld in their entirety, if any; and\r\n* Demonstrate that only the **minimal exempt portion** of any record has been withheld, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Public Records Act requires agencies to justify each withholding or redaction:\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.210(3): \u201cAgency responses refusing, in whole or in part, inspection of any public record shall include a statement of the specific exemption authorizing the withholding of the record (or part) and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.\u201d\r\nRCW 42.56.210(1): Exemptions must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have repeatedly enforced this duty:\r\n\r\nRental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 538 (2009): Agencies must provide specific explanations for each exemption; conclusory or vague justifications are insufficient.\r\nSanders v. State*, 169 Wn.2d 827, 845 (2010): \u201cThe burden of proof is on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute.\u201d\r\nResident Action Council v. Seattle Housing Auth.* 177 Wn.2d 417, 433 (2013): Agencies must disclose the non-exempt portions*of records and cannot withhold more than necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that your agency provide an itemized exemption log with each installment of records produced, in compliance with RCW 42.56.210(3) and the above case law, ensuring transparency and accountability in the redaction process.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose. The Washington State Public Records Act (PRA) prohibits agencies from disclosing \u201clists of individuals\u201d for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) states:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nThis request does not seek a \u201clist of individuals.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56.070(8) regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWarning: The PRA does not authorize agencies to require requestors to complete additional \u201ccommercial purpose declarations\u201d when the request does not seek a list of individuals. Such requirements improperly condition access to public records in violation of RCW 42.56.080(2) (requests must be honored by mail or email, no official format required) and RCW 42.56.100 (agencies must provide the fullest assistance to requestors and may not adopt rules that unreasonably hinder or delay access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently rejected agency attempts to impose conditions not found in statute:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): The PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure; agencies cannot erect unauthorized barriers.\r\n\r\nSEIU 925 v. University of Washington, 193 Wn.2d 860, 875 (2019): The PRA is to be liberally construed to promote access, and exemptions must be narrowly applied.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this request. Any attempt to impose such a requirement would be an unlawful restriction of rights under RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 (Retention of Public Records) makes clear that public records are subject to retention schedules, and that unlawful destruction can constitute a crime.\r\n\r\nRCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020 criminalize the unlawful mutilation, destruction, or concealment of public records.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.100 expressly prohibits an agency from destroying any public record after a public records request has been made for that record, even if the record would otherwise be scheduled for lawful destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, agencies have heightened retention obligations when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Records potentially relevant to actual or anticipated litigation must be preserved until both the public records request and the litigation have been fully resolved.\r\n\r\nLegal Consequences of Premature Destruction\r\n\r\nIn Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that an agency violates the Public Records Act and is subject to attorneys\u2019 fees and statutory penalties when it destroys responsive records after receiving a public records request.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is not a PRA violation if a record was destroyed prior to the agency\u2019s receipt of a request, provided the destruction was lawful under retention schedules. See Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) and the state\u2019s records retention laws (RCW 40.14) are separate but complementary. Agencies must comply with both.\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nYour agency must preserve all potentially responsive records immediately upon receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nNo responsive records may be altered, deleted, or destroyed until this request has been fully resolved and any related litigation has been lifted.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful destruction of responsive records may expose the agency and its officials to criminal liability (RCW 40.16), civil penalties, and mandatory attorneys\u2019 fees (RCW 42.56.550(4)).\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Any records pertaining to a patrol between August 11-15, 2025, at Lamont St. NW and Mt. Pleasant St. SW, in Washington, D.C., which is depicted in these videos: https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r and https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828.\r\n\r\n2. Any photographs, audio, or video captured by the law enforcement officials or employees during the above-mentioned patrol. This includes all raw and unedited video recorded by the device used to record this video (https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) on the date that video (i.e., https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) was recorded.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the federal government's removal of a banner in a public park during a patrol of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest, as exemplified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's decision to publicize the video on its official social media account and by news coverage of the event.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/mount-pleasant-ice-immigration-federal-takeover-trump-donald-dc-washington/65-b6bfbde6-030d-41e7-8c46-4f0b96944a3a\r\nb. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/ice-immigration-dc-washington-mount-pleasant/65-d3517d58-d9e1-4f47-974b-e8ad4575a4d4\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement officers with the approval of officials at the Department of Homeland Security and/or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public.

Any records pertaining to a patrol between August 11-15, 2025, at Lamont St. NW and Mt. Pleasant St. SW, in Washington, D.C., which is depicted in these videos: https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r and https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828.\r\n\r\n2. Any photographs, audio, or video captured by the law enforcement officials or employees during the above-mentioned patrol. This includes all raw and unedited video recorded by the device used to record this video (https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) on the date that video (i.e., https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) was recorded.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the federal government's removal of a banner in a public park during a patrol of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest, as exemplified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's decision to publicize the video on its official social media account and by news coverage of the event.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/mount-pleasant-ice-immigration-federal-takeover-trump-donald-dc-washington/65-b6bfbde6-030d-41e7-8c46-4f0b96944a3a\r\nb. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/ice-immigration-dc-washington-mount-pleasant/65-d3517d58-d9e1-4f47-974b-e8ad4575a4d4\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement officers with the approval of officials at the Department of Homeland Security and/or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media.

Pleasant St. SW. \r\n\r\nYour request was received in this office on 8/15/2025. \r\n\r\nAfter careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope or did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking. \r\n\r\nBased on the video link you provided, we are unable to determine what DHS component officers were at that location. Please provide more information. \r\n\r\nRecords must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \r\n\r\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components.  Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions.  A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online:  https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information.  If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office.  Otherwise, respond back with your additional information. \r\n\r\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  This is not a denial of your request.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

        "communication": "Hello --\r\n\r\nI submitted a revised request, which indicated that the officers involved may be affiliated with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Alternatively, ICE is aware of details of the patrol because its social media team was able to obtain some of the video that I am requesting and shared it on its Twitter account. That should be sufficient for DHS to be able to identify the agency components involved in the patrol.\r\n\r\nBelow is a copy of the revised request and request for expedited processing:\r\n\r\nHello --\r\n\r\nThis is an amendment to my request and a request for expedited processing.\r\n\r\nFirst, please amend the request to seek:\r\n\r\n1. Any records pertaining to a patrol between August 11-15, 2025, at Lamont St. NW and Mt. Pleasant St. SW, in Washington, D.C., which is depicted in these videos: https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r and https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828.\r\n\r\n2. Any photographs, audio, or video captured by the law enforcement officials or employees during the above-mentioned patrol. This includes all raw and unedited video recorded by the device used to record this video (https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) on the date that video (i.e., https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) was recorded.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the federal government's removal of a banner in a public park during a patrol of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest, as exemplified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's decision to publicize the video on its official social media account and by news coverage of the event.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/mount-pleasant-ice-immigration-federal-takeover-trump-donald-dc-washington/65-b6bfbde6-030d-41e7-8c46-4f0b96944a3a\r\nb. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/ice-immigration-dc-washington-mount-pleasant/65-d3517d58-d9e1-4f47-974b-e8ad4575a4d4\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement officers with the approval of officials at the Department of Homeland Security and/or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.",
