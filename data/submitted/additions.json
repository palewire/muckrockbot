I am requesting copies of the receipts that constituted these expenses.\r\n\r\n2) FWPD's most recent policy protocol on work travel expenses. (Per a  4/28/25 Fort Worth Report story, a spokesperson said \"Trip expenses were covered following our policy protocols\").\r\n\r\nIf you determine that some but not all the information we\u2019ve requested is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, I ask that you redact it for the time being and make the rest available on a rolling basis. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage, and therefore we request that you waive any costs.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I also ask that our request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available (email: bdavis@star-telegram.com) \u2013 if not, secure file transfer, thumb drive, or CD-ROM. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBradford Davis",
