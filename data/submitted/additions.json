More specifically Im looking for the court records regarding Ms.Martin's 2017 arrest. I believe the case number is 2017033212. Originally, I thought this criminal case played out in Ventura County's Court. When I requested records from their records department, they told me that the case was transfered to Los Angeles County on 11/16/18.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAli Assaf",
