However, in reviewing your request I do not see a date range in which you are seeking responsive records.  Please let me know what date range you are asking us to search within.  This will allow me to complete the search in a timely fashion.  Additionally, the inclusion of common names (i.e. Karen etc.) is likely to capture numerous communications that may or may not be relevant to your intended request.  To the extent you are able to provide more specific search terms it will aid in processing the request and reduce the volume of unrelated items that are pulled.  Finally, the inclusion of \"Morrisey\" as a search term will result in any emails or communications with the Attorney General's name in signature blocks.  Again, to the extent you are able to provide clarity on the information sought or let me know which search terms should be search in conjunction with each other, rather than each individually, it will aid in processing your request so that we are able to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me at this address or call me at 304-558-1482 to discuss this matter at your convenience.\r\n\r\nOnce I have received the date range, and any other clarification, I will be able to provide you with a date our response will be provided.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n\r\nSteven A.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTitle and Copy List of the district's library catalog including all titles, authors, ISBN and copy information (example copies/location). \r\n\r\nNote: This information can generally be easily retrieved by a district level user of Follett using the Generate a Title & Copy List Report (Library Manager) feature of the Follett catalogue. Instructions are attached and  located here https://legacyhelp.fsc.follett.com/content/t_generate_title_copy_list_report.htm. Please include all titles (regardless of status) and include the categories and circulation statistics. \r\n\r\nPlease output the file(s) as Excel.\r\n\r\nIn the event the report is limited by the 10,000 title limit, please split it the catalogue information into multiple groupings as the report allows. For instance you could limit the titles in each file by selecting groupings A-G and H-Z.\r\n\r\nAs censorship is at an all time high, we are conducting research on titles that may be most at risk of censorship across Texas. We hope to assist schools in their mission of maintaining young learners critical access to books in their libraries.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSidney Braveword",

As per our previous correspondence, I am considering your request fulfilled by the provided closing reports, which were redacted pursuant to FOIL. \r\nThe CCRB closing report does not represent the final agency determination of the Board; it is merely a recommendation by the investigator to the Board. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g)(iii) permits the CCRB to deny access to records that are \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency materials which are not . . . final agency policy or determinations.\u201d\u00a0 Accordingly, we do not disclose CCRB work product, opinions, recommendations, advice, or records which reflect the consultative and deliberative process. Such records were redacted because they do not constitute final agency determinations. \r\nAdditionally, these reports contain information, such as names, addresses, ages, and dates of birth, and other personal identifying information as defined in Public Officers Law \u00a7 89. As a City agency, we are also subject to N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 23-1201 and are required to withhold personal identifying information to the extent permitted under FOIL. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(b) permits the CCRB to deny access to records or information that \u201cif disclosed would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Such personal identifying information has been redacted. \r\nNYS Office of Court Administration records are exempt from FOIL under Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 86(1), 86(3), and 86(4), which define \"judiciary,\" \"agency,\" and \"record\" and state that records from agencies that are identified as judiciary are exempt from FOIL. Additionally, the CCRB has a contract with the Office of Court Administration that conditions our ability to access their records, a necessity for our investigations, on not releasing those records except as proscribed by the contract. So as to not interfere with the contract the CCRB has with the New York State Officer of Court Administration as permitted under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(c) and to comply with the defined terms of FOIL, any information obtained from the search of the Office of Court Administration\u2019s database have been redacted. \r\nOther redactions, such as those based on Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 87(2)(a) (\"specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal statute\u201d), 87(2)(e) (law enforcement and investigative records), 87(2)(f) (life and safety), and 87(4-b) (technical infractions) are noted as applicable within the reports. \r\n \r\nYou may appeal the decision to deny access to material that was redacted in part or withheld in entirety by contacting the agency's FOIL Appeals Officer: foil@ccrb.nyc.gov within 30 days.

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",
