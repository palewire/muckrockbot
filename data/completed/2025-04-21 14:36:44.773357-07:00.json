In order for IU to begin processing your request, you will need to provide further information regarding the record(s) you are requesting. APRA requires that a request for inspection and/or copying must identify with reasonable particularity the record(s) being requested. I.C. 5-14-3-3(a)(1). The Indiana Court of Appeals has held that \"[w]hether a request identifies with reasonable particularity the record being requested turns, in part, on whether the person making the request provides the agency with information that enables the agency to search for, locate and retrieve records.\" Jent v. Fort Wayne Police Dep't, 973 N.E.2d 30, 34 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\r\nAs currently written, your below request does not identify reasonably particular parameters that enable the University to \"search for, locate and retrieve records.\" While the term \"reasonable particularity\" is not defined within APRA, I encourage you to read the many opinions of the Indiana Public Access Counselor, along with Anderson v. Huntington Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 983 N.E.2d 613 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013).\r\n\r\nPer this authority, please further specify the type(s) of record(s) that you are seeking in response to your request below.

Specifically:\r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

The period of said report shall be from October 1st, 2020 to August 24th, 2021. \n\nPlease include in the said report: \n- Expected Departures \n- Out-of country Overstays \n- Suspected In-Country Overstays \n- Include age groups and gender \n\nRecords are attached to this email. \n\nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, CBP has determined that they are approved for release in their entirety, no deletions or exemptions have been applied. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-2021-098543 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

You requested the following: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAny and all personnel records and files related to complaints, misconduct, and disciplinary actions involving officer Kevin McLaughlin of the Bellingham Police Department. \r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting copies of the following documents: \r\n\r\nAny formal complaints filed against officer McLaughlin either by members of the public, or by fellow officers or his superiors. \r\n\r\nAny internal investigations conducted in response to these complaints or recorded misconduct, including all findings, communications, and conclusions. \r\n\r\nAny disciplinary actions taken against officer McLaughlin as a result of these complaints or misconduct, including but not limited to suspension records, reprimands, and training records related to corrective actions. \r\n\r\nAny records detailing the status, rank, and assignment of officer McLaughlin within the Bellingham Police Department. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSafe Community \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fbellingham-police-department-7784%252Fofficer-k-mclaughlin-records-185028%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAAVjpgQZLkPj-vO60a0SB4kqx8%3A1u4X47%3A0c4T2hfthBhcdaYBlwwWKP_TsDvQjgbguPOnheuxI9E\" \r\n\r\nI am writing to acknowledge receipt of your request and to provide a reasonable estimate of the time the City will need to respond to it.  The City needs additional time to locate and assemble the records requested and to determine whether any of the requested records are exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request.  For these reasons, I estimate that the City will need approximately 4 weeks in order to respond to your request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the police department may also exercise its right to provide the responsive records in installments as they become available. \r\n\r\nYou may contact Police Records at (360) 778-8700 if you have any questions about this request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nBellingham Police Records Division",

Please allow this correspondence to serve as the City\u2019s follow-up correspondence to your public records act (\u201cPRA\u201d) request below.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the City has reviewed your PRA request and has determined it seeks an excessively large volume of potentially responsive documents spanning a 10-year period, which at this time, would pose a significant undue burden on limited staff time and resources.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to streamline the documents you seek, the City is requesting further clarification pertaining to the categories of records requested below:\r\n\r\n- Any accounting records or statistics on seized real estate, vehicles, firearms, funds in bank accounts, and seizures made by the department, as well as seizures made by federal authorities where the department receives a share under the MOUs the department has in place with numerous agencies describing how assets are to be divided. Please clarify whether you seek information on all seized items, or whether this is specifically requesting information on seizures relating to asset forfeiture.  As phrased, the request is ambiguous and overbroad.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\n- Sales of non-monetary assets, receipts of sale for vehicles, or the destruction of other non-monetary assets. Please clarify whether this category is specific to asset forfeitures.  As phrased, it is ambiguous and overbroad.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\n-Please also include any information relating to contested seizures. This request does not include court documents for individual forfeiture cases.  This request as phrased\u2014\u201cany information\u201d\u2014is incredibly overbroad.  Please identify which types of documents and/or specific categories of records you seek.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nFinally, as your request spans a 10-year period, please understand the City will need additional time to locate potentially responsive records to this request.  If you could further narrow the time-period requested, it would expedite the processing of these documents for disclosure.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  We look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nKelsey\r\n\r\nKelsey Quist<http://www.rutan.com/Kelsey-Quist>\r\n18575 Jamboree Road, 9th Floor | Irvine, CA 92612\r\nO. (714) 641-5100 | D.

Information related to the date, quantity, cost, invoices, item description, what was bought, what was sold, and what was donated should also be included. \r\n\r\n-Please also include any information relating to contested seizures.

I request a search of all locations where such documents might be located, including but not limited to the entertainment liaison offices and communications HQ or similar offices.\r\n\r\nAttached is a document, released to me by the FBI in response to a previous FOIA request, confirming that the FBI supported the production of \"Rising Hate: Antisemitism in America.\"\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

These medical records are crucial to the adoption of these K9s)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request encompasses, but is not limited to, all records of complaints received, inspection reports, investigative files, and any other documents generated or compiled by the Bureau in connection with said investigations. Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is crucial to myself, as I am the current adopter of a Contract Working Dog (CWD) that Anne Gibbs had her in possession for a period of time. I state 'Her Possession' because to refer to it as 'Care' would do a disservice to CWD Cezar. He was one of the 28 K9s that were seized from her property, and rescued from PSPCA, where he remained until I adopted him. In addition, this case is  demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved. There are several posts on Anne Gibbs public social media page, which I believe, are possible indicators of continued neglect.\r\n\r\nI currently serve as a K9 Handler in the Private Sector, along with a branch of the Department of Defense. I am a Nationally Certified K9 Handler, with extreme knowledge and certification of these working K9s.  I am also still serving as a member of the United States Army, as a Military Police Officer. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on USB/CD-ROM. I can provide the CD-ROM/USB if requested. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nJulia Valenti\r\nCPT, MP\r\nCommanding\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I also request data on license-exempt providers, if available. Specifically, I request the following information as it is available:\r\n1) Provider name or ID\r\n2) Street number\r\n3) Street name\r\n4) City\r\n5) Zip code\r\n6) Licensed capacity for each year (by child age group if available)\r\n7) Enrollment for each year (by child age group if available)\r\n8) Provider type (e.g., center-based provider, home-based provider, Head Start, school-based pre-K, etc.) for each year\r\n9) First license issue (open) date\r\n10) Most recent license issue date\r\n11) Most recent license expiration date or close date\r\n12) Ages served for each year\r\n13) Hours of operation for each year\r\n14) QRIS rating for each year (please explain who is required to participate and whether there are financial supports based on rating)\r\n15) Accepts Child Care and Development Fund subsidies for each year\r\n16) Accepts other types of subsidies for each year (please list types)\r\n17) Prices for each year (by child age group if available)\r\n18) Violation records\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. Sincerely, Gabrielle Pepin Upload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Foregon-department-of-early-learning-and-care-35979%252Fchild-care-provider-data-182223%252F%253Femail%253DKris.REMMY%252540delc.oregon.gov&url_auth_token=AAG3JGu6ZMgu682BXFnl5LQKSvc%3A1tnrjJ%3AwXqf2ORiKbaGpNjOX3xY8XNxkULKYCZZZEAtk3cMUnc\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is to confirm that DELC is the custodian of the requested records. Before we can proceed, we need some additional clarification.\r\n\r\nThere are no responsive records to the following data points, as requested:\r\n\r\n  *   DELC does not collect, monitor, or track any data on license exempt providers, unless they are a recorded program.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor or track enrollment.\r\n  *   DELC does monitor some provider types (center-based or home-based), but we do not monitor or track other specific program/service types.\r\n  *   DELC monitors a provider\u2019s acceptance of subsidies only if they are a current participant, so there is no historical data available.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor or track previous QRIS ratings, only the current QRIS rating of an active/most recent awarding.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor the price of services offered.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are currently unable to determine if there is historical data for the following:\r\n\r\n  *   Hours of operation.\r\n  *   Ages served.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Oregon Revised Statues ORS 192.365, your request does not show by clear and convincing evidence that the public interest requires disclosure of the requested information for RF and CF facilities in this particular instance. Therefore, we are only able to share the following information:\r\n\r\n     *   Active RF and CF facilities: Facility name and facility city/state/zip.\r\n     *   Active CC facilities: Facility name, full facility address (street and number, city/state/zip).\r\n\r\nThe request for violation records spanning \u201cas far back as the data systems allow\u201d is denied. The request is too broad, and the information is available on our Child Safety Portal, as found here: Find Child Care Oregon - Find Child Care Oregon<https://findchildcareoregon.org/>\r\n\r\nOregon Revised Statues Referenced:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   ORS 192.365: Child care facility operator and exempt family child care provider information (residential address and telephone numbers, personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, Social Security numbers, employer-issued identification card numbers, and emergency contact information)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with a quote for the portions of your request that are available, please let me know by responding to this email.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n[A picture containing graphics, cartoon  Description automatically generated]\r\nMadison Buck (She/Her)\u200b\r\nDepartment of Early Learning and Care\u200b\r\nPublic Records and Communication Specialist\r\nDELC.PRRequest@DELC.oregon.gov<mailto:DELC.PRRequest@DELC.oregon.gov>\r\nWebsite: Oregon.gov/DELC<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/4T6sCW6qNgs52KYX8Ix6GqA?domain=oregon.gov>\u200b\r\nConnect with DELC: Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/OREarlyLearning/> | Instagram<https://www.instagram.com/OREarlyLearning/> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/@OREarlyLearning> | LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/OREarlyLearning/>\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Department of Early Learning and Care (DELC) fosters coordinated, culturally appropriate, and family-centered services that recognize and respect the strengths of children, families and early learning and care professionals.

If you would like to adjust your request to encompass a smaller time period of data, that would adjust the quote as seen below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with ORS 192.324(4)(a), the public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse the public body for the public body\u2019s actual cost of making public records available, including costs for summarizing, compiling or tailoring the public records, either in organization or media, to meet the request.\r\n\r\nThe estimate to produce the requested records is as follows (subject to change):\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nHours\r\nHourly Rate\r\nSubtotal\r\nPull and organize records\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nReview and redaction for exempt material\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Estimated clerical time\r\n2.0 hours, with the first 30 minutes waived\r\n1.5\r\n$37.50\r\n$37.50\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Cost\r\n$37.50\r\n\r\nDELC requires 50% of the total cost to begin work on this request, which would be $18.75.\r\n\r\nWe will update this estimate with the actual time it takes to process this request, and the remainder of the cost will be due prior to delivery.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the actual cost exceeds this estimate, we will contact you for approval to proceed with additional work.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Charles Leo Daniel, who died in ICE Custody March 7, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrDanielCharlesLeo.pdf.. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25069. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, I am requesting access to the list of Twitter profiles blocked by the Ossining Police Department's official Twitter account (@OssiningPolice).\r\n\r\nTo assist you in locating these records, please follow the steps below to view the blocked profiles:\r\n\r\nLog into the @OssiningPolice Twitter account.\r\nClick on 'More' in the menu on the left-hand side.\r\nClick on 'Settings and privacy'.\r\nSelect 'Privacy and safety'.\r\nScroll down to 'Safety' and click on 'Blocked accounts'. Here, you will find the list of all blocked profiles.\r\nGiven that these records relate to a public department's social media, which is utilized for communication with and among the public, they should fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to two cases related to social media blocking and the First Amendment. The first is Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump (2017), where the court found that blocking users from an official's Twitter account, which is used as a public forum, is a violation of their First Amendment rights. The second is Davison v. Randall (2019), where the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals extended this reasoning to local officials.\r\n\r\nWhile these cases deal with blocking individuals on Twitter, they provide the legal context under which public officials and departments must operate when considering whether to block individuals from their social media accounts.\r\n\r\nGiven these precedents, the block list of the Ossining Police Department's Twitter account should constitute disclosable public records under the FOIA as they pertain to potential infringements on First Amendment activity.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
