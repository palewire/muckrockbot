Case is stayed until the criminal proceeding is concluded.\r\nKonneh is in custody, and has an assigned criminal defense counsel, Mr.  Hammerstad.  We have coordinated several interviews between Hammerstad and our employees on the advice of Mick McFarland at Evans Lackie.  At our request, SIAW hired separate civil defense counsel (Floyd at Floyd Pfluger) for our former employee, which Mick thought might reduce the likelihood of our employee being found liable and foisting off all the judgment on us.  We are following Mick\u2019s advise and cooperating with our insurance carrier, the latter being a condition of coverage.  We are having nascent discussions about a Joint Defense Agreement, which may help us deal with records requests.
