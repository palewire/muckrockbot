If an entire document is exempt, please provide a justification citing specific exemptions.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure no records potentially responsive to this request are destroyed. Any improper withholding, redaction, or destruction of records may be subject to litigation under the New York Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for processing this request, as the information sought contributes significantly to public understanding of police operations and accountability.\r\n\r\nIf there are potential charges exceeding $200 associated with fulfilling this request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe as outlined in the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request Letter\r\nScreen Capture of the Previous MuckRock FOIL-2023-056-09276\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on muckrock.com.

In accordance with legal precedents (Konigsberg v. Coughlin, Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine), I assert that neither the size nor the perceived administrative burden should impede access to information.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of this request be denied, I request a detailed justification for each refusal, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and an exemption log as established by Vaughn v. Rosen and Fisher v. United States Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with legal obligations outlined in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Department of Defense, please ensure the preservation of records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the requested information electronically.

Any and all drone footage captured during pro-Palestine protests in the specified timeframe.\r\n2. Correspondence, memos, or guidelines related to the use of drones for monitoring protests.\r\n3. Any reports or analyses generated from the collected drone footage.\r\n\r\n4. Communications between NYPD personnel discussing the deployment, use, and analysis of drone footage during pro-Palestine protests.\r\n\r\n5. Logs or records indicating the specific dates, times, and locations where drones were deployed to monitor pro-Palestine protests, with a particular focus on the key locations such as Times Square, Penn Station, and Rockefeller Center.\r\n\r\n6. Training materials or documentation provided to NYPD personnel regarding the use of drones for surveillance purposes in the context of public gatherings or protests.\r\n\r\n7. Any agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding between the NYPD and external entities, including federal agencies or private contractors, related to the use of drones during the specified pro-Palestine protests.\r\n\r\n8. Policies or procedures governing the retention and storage of drone footage, including any guidelines for the deletion or preservation of such records.\r\n\r\nIn order to narrow down the search, I request that a key string search be performed for terms such as \"protest,\" \"demonstration,\" \"Palestine,\" and any relevant keywords used during surveillance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to specify the following locations for the requested drone footage:\r\n\r\n- Times Square\r\n- Penn Station\r\n- Rockefeller Center\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\n1. **North Carolina Press Ass'n v. North Carolina Dep't of Crime Control & Public Safety,** 323 N.C. 373, 381 (1988): This case establishes the public's right to access government records, especially those related to surveillance and protests, and supports the principle that such records are subject to disclosure under FOIA.\r\n\r\n2. **Blackwell v. FBI,** 646 F.3d 37, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2011): This case reaffirms the public's right to access law enforcement records and emphasizes the importance of transparency in government activities.\r\n\r\n3. **ACLU v. FBI,** 2017 WL 4563355 (D.D.C. Oct. 12, 2017): This case underscores the public's right to access information related to government surveillance, especially in the context of protests and political activities. It establishes the principle that transparency in surveillance practices is essential for maintaining a free and open society.\r\n\r\n4. **Detroit Free Press, Inc. v. DOJ,** 73 F.3d 93 (6th Cir. 1996): This case reaffirms the importance of disclosing information related to law enforcement activities, highlighting the government's duty to provide the public with access to records that contribute to an understanding of government operations.\r\n\r\n5. **John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp.,** 493 U.S. 146 (1989): This Supreme Court decision emphasizes the presumption of openness in government activities, stating that agencies should be compelled to disclose records unless the information falls under a specific exemption. It supports the idea that transparency is vital for accountability and informed public discourse.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per **Vaughn v. Rosen,** 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in **Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,** 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records responsive to clown sightings and threats made by individuals identifying as clowns between January 01, 2016 and December 31, 2018. \r\n\r\nIn August 2016, reports of clown sightings in Greenville, South Carolina set off a national panic and residents of multiple states claimed to have interactions with individuals dressed in clown costumes and making threats against schools. On multiple occasions law enforcement officials stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was involved with investigations related to these sightings and threats. The following stories appeared around the country in September 2016:\r\n\r\n1) Gallatin County Sheriff Josh Neale stated that he was consulting with the FBI on one such case involving terroristic threats at the Gallatin County Schools in Gallatin County, Kentucky. According to WCPO, an ABC affiliate based out of Cincinnati, Ohio: \"Neale has contacted the FBI and Homeland Security and said the person or people making the 'clown threats' could face local charges of inducing panic and terroristic threatening.\"\r\n\r\nA link can be found here: https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/creepy-clowns-threaten-kentucky-schools\r\n\r\n2) Officers working for the Phoenix Police Department stated that the FBI and its Phoenix Joint Terrorism Task Force assisted in an investigation after threats were made against 24 schools in the Phoenix Union and Glendale school districts. According to ABC 13, an ABC affiliate based out Houston, Texas: \"Police did not specify what the threats said, only that it involved violence and the same clown image. A terrorism task force and the FBI are assisting police with their investigation, officers said.\"\r\n\r\nA link can be found here: https://abc13.com/clown-threats-phoenix-union-glendale-school-district-social-media/1529983/\r\n\r\n3) FBI agents participated in a search of Flomaton High School connected to online threats. According to the Washington Post: \"Callaway Middle School was not the only school involved in the clown brouhaha. In the Alabama city of Flomaton, messages from a Facebook page called 'Flomo Klown' \u2014 pictures of threatening clowns plus text that read, 'I kill people for a living' \u2014 prompted another lockdown Thursday. FBI agents and dozens of local police scoured the school campus. Officials said they found no clown or other suspicious evidence; they later arrested Makayla Smith, 22, and two juvenile Alabama residents for allegedly making the threats. Smith\u2019s bond was set at $200,000 on Monday.\"\r\n\r\nA link can be found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/20/creepy-clowns-police-begin-making-arrests-as-false-reports-and-threats-plague-southern-towns/\r\n\r\nGiven that law enforcement officials in numerous cities claimed that they either consulted with or had knowledge of FBI involvement in investigations related to clown sightings, it is reasonable to conclude that records were created by the FBI in these cases and potentially others. Therefore, I am requesting all records related to clown sightings and threats made by individuals identifying as clowns in the period of January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2018\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Over the course of 2016, the reports of clown sightings caused a national panic, resulting in school closures and lockdowns. Understanding how a federal agency like the FBI assisted in managing that panic can offer insight into best practices for responding to national security emergencies related to mass hysterias and panics in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

(\"Current,\" for the purposes of this request, means current at the time this request is fulfilled, not when this request was made.)\r\n\r\nIf helpful in locating these records, it appears that form submissions are sent to this API endpoint: https://www.fatherhood.gov/for-dads/dad-jokes?ajax_form=1&_wrapper_format=drupal_ajax\r\n\r\nIn keeping with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B), which stipulates that an agency \"shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or format,\" and Title II of Public Law 115-435, which further reiterates federal agencies' obligation to provide data in a a\"machine-readable\" format (\"the term 'machine-readable', when used with respect to data, means data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost,\" see P.L. 115-435, Title II (The \"Open Government Act\"), 202(a)(3))), I request that these records be provided in an electronic format that can be imported into standard database software. Examples include an Excel .xlsx file, a text-based delimited file (.csv, .txt., .tsv., etc.), a .json file, a .dbf file or an SQL dump. This would NOT include PDFs or other non-machine-readable formats. The records I request are collected via web form on what appears to be a Drupal website, so there is no question that the records I seek already exist as machine-readable data.\r\n\r\nIn the event that my request is denied in whole or part, please justify any deletions by referencing specific exemptions of the FOIA. I expect you to release all \"reasonably segregable portion(s)\" of otherwise exempt material, as stipulated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCody Winchester",

Both the code compliance department and the relocation department. \u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nThe quote above is a part of an email correspondence where my former landlord, Anthony De Maio, informaed me that I am to expect a final ruling on my application for the Code Compliance Relocation Payment Program. This was stated before my actual appeal have been submitted.\r\n\r\nMr. De Maio also claimed that he had already been found innocent by the City when responding to a 3rd party mediation service. No released documents by City of Oakland regard this matter or the property located at 918-920 Oak St. Indicate any communications, and appear to show no communication has in fact occurred, as there is no Owner Response or indications that violations have been abated according to city records.\r\n\r\nRecords Requested:\r\n\r\n-\tAll communications, internal or external, that contributed to or were part of the decision-making process related to;\r\n\r\n-\tDocuments related to any deals, determinations, decisions, or contracts made in relation to my case\r\n\r\nTHE INITIAL DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CCRPP \r\n\r\nFOR CHRISTIAN JAY REETZ DATED 12/11/23 BY KELLY HOFFMAN\r\n\r\nPeriod of Records Requested: \r\n\r\n-\t Documents created after June 1, 2023, until current (time of retrieval)\r\n\r\nSpecific Records Requested:\r\nHousing and Community Development Program\r\nProgram Manager Kelly Hoffman\r\nHousing Specialist Corean Todd\r\n\r\n\r\nPertaining to the following following:\r\no\tBuilding and Planning Department, Code Enforcement: \r\nInspector Christopher Scyphers, \r\nInspector Travis Ha, \r\nSupervisor Inspector David Miles.\r\no\tOakland Housing Authority: \r\nRisk Management Director Cha Yang.\r\no\tPrivate Individuals/Housing Providers: \r\nAnthony De Maio, \r\nAntoinette \u2018Peggy\u2019 Ramirez De Maio, \r\nJuan Santiago, \r\nAmanda J. Beren, \r\nA De Maio Properties, \r\nand related email addresses.\r\n\r\nSpecific properties: \r\n920 Oak, 918-920 Oak, \r\n331 Hanover, \r\n570 Grand, \r\n1600 4th, \r\n1507 5th, \r\n185 5th, \r\n555 S. 2nd / 555 S SECOND (and similar combinations).\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAny documents referring to mold (including Stachybotrys, Aspergillus, Penicillium), encompassing inspections, complaints, remediation efforts, and health impacts.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRecords related to relocation processes, especially concerning the Code Compliance Relocation Payment Program and any related correspondence or assistance offers.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDetails about specific units (Apt/Unit #9, #11, #12), roof conditions, interactions with Bay Area Mold Pros, remediation efforts, relocation challenges, Lake View/Encampment issues, habitability assessments, escrow details, appeals, abatement actions, and any reference to Code Compliance Relocation Payment Program.\r\n\r\nI'm requesting records from personal email accounts used by city officials, t in addition to their official email addresses. This request stems from an instance where Corean Todd provided me with a personal Gmail account for Kelly Hoffman when providing me with contact details regarding my appeal process, therefor the scope of my request encompasses a query into the use of alternate email addresses being used for official City Business such as my appeal.\r\n\r\nTHIS INCLUDES EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR ALL ABOVE  NAMED CITY OFFICIALS THAT APPEAR FIRST INITIAL + LAST NAME = GMAIL.COM\r\n\r\n ( Example; KHoffman@gmail.com )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the serious nature of these issues, including the violations of my right to procedural due process, I request expedited processing of this public records request. These matters not only impact me personally but could also have broader implications for public interest and community trust in Oakland's housing and development governance. I will be contacting Public Ethics Commission about this matter for procedural oversight to work as diligently as I can to ensure the  evidence of both parties is weighed impartially and ethically in a manner that adheres to established City protocol \r\n\r\nMost importantly I am compelled to emphasize this matter due to the direct and severe health implications that the buildings infestation can have on the current residents, as we exit yet another storm and more opportunities for water damage arise. My unit is the second unit that has had to uproot due to the habitability issues present at the site.\r\n\r\nI certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. Happy New Years, please stay safe and dry- I look forward to your prompt response and the provision of the requested records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChristian J. Reetz",
