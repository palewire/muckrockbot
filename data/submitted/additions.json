This obligation is supported by case law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tNational Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense (2004):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case establishes the principle that agencies must conduct comprehensive searches and cannot rely on overly broad or restrictive interpretations of FOIA exemptions.\r\n\t\u2022\tDow Jones & Co. v. Department of Justice (1986):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case underscores the obligation of agencies to make a good-faith effort to search for responsive records and provides guidance on the scope of such searches.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these legal precedents, I request that the ATF take all necessary measures to ensure a thorough and diligent search for the requested records. Any failure to do so would constitute a violation of FOIA obligations.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease adhere to your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted, and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your thorough attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

This request specifically emphasizes activities related to Defense Distributed and thegatalog.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, I am seeking the following detailed records:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInternal Memos and Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny internal memos, emails, or communications discussing the identification, tracking, or handling of ghost guns within the NYPD during the specified period.\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence related to Defense Distributed and their impact on the proliferation of ghost guns.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunication regarding any collaborations or information sharing with federal agencies, such as the ATF or FBI, on ghost gun-related matters.\r\n\t2.\tInvestigative Reports and Cases:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll documents related to investigations or cases conducted by the NYPD involving ghost guns from January 1, 2019, through the date this request is processed.\r\n\t\u2022\tSpecifically, information on cases associated with Defense Distributed and any links to thegatalog.\r\n\t\u2022\tReports detailing the outcomes of investigations, including arrests made, charges filed, and any convictions related to ghost gun activities.\r\n\t3.\tPolicies and Guidelines:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of policies, guidelines, or procedures implemented by the NYPD in response to the increased prevalence of ghost guns during the specified period.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny directives related to Defense Distributed and efforts to address the challenges posed by ghost guns.\r\n\t\u2022\tInformation on the training provided to law enforcement officers regarding the identification and handling of ghost guns.\r\n\t4.\tTechnology and Tools:\r\n\t\u2022\tDocumentation on any specialized technology or tools employed by the NYPD for the detection and tracking of ghost guns from January 1, 2019, through the date this request is processed.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords pertaining to partnerships or collaborations with private entities, including tech companies, for the development or use of tools related to ghost gun prevention.\r\n\t5.\tStatistics on Confiscations and Arrests:\r\n\t\u2022\tComprehensive statistics on confiscations of ghost guns by the NYPD during the specified period.\r\n\t\u2022\tData on arrests made by the NYPD in relation to ghost guns, specifying charges filed and outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, the NYPD has a legal obligation under the FOIA to conduct a thorough search for all responsive records. This obligation is supported by case law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tNational Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense (2004):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case establishes the principle that agencies must conduct comprehensive searches and cannot rely on overly broad or restrictive interpretations of FOIA exemptions.\r\n\t\u2022\tDow Jones & Co. v.

Any failure to do so would constitute a violation of FOIA obligations.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease adhere to your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted, and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your thorough attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.
