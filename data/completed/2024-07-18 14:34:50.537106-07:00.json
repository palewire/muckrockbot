        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

His name is sometimes rendered as \"Adnan Mohamad Khashoggi\" or \"Adnan M. Khashoggi.\" He is listed on Wikipedia as having the date of birth July 25, 1935. Adnan Khashoggi is widely reported to have died in 2017 in London, England (see attached article from the NY Times); records concerning him as a subject should thus be assumed free from FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all Department of State systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies.  Systems of records of interest to a search include (not exclusively):\r\n\r\nBureau of Economic and Business Affairs Contact List, STATE-03\r\nExternal Research Records, STATE-10\r\nExtradition Records, STATE-11\r\nInternational Conference Delegates Records, STATE-16\r\nIntelligence and Research Records, STATE-15\r\nInternational Organizations Records, STATE-17\r\nMunitions Control Records, STATE-42\r\nCongressional Correspondence Records, STATE-43\r\nCongressional Travel Records, STATE-44\r\nIdentity Management System (IDMS), STATE-72.\r\nInternational Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Personnel Records (INLPR), STATE-74\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that Department of State has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We understand you are seeking the following records: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\nAny guidance Documents or communication issued by SOS or King County Elections with respect to implementing 6269's pilot program.\" I am responding to you on behalf of the King County Elections only pursuant to King County Code 2.12.005 and 2.12.230(B). Your request includes references to records of the Secretary of State. We are only able to provide records that are within our care, though the secretary of state may also have responsive records.\u00a0You will need make a request directly to the Secretary of State if you wish to seek its records:  WA Secretary\u00a0of State - Public Records Office \r\nPO BOX 40224 \r\nOlympia, WA 98504-0224 \r\nPhone: (360) 704-5220 \r\nFax: (360) 704-7834 \r\nEmail: publicrecords@sos.wa.gov (publicrecords@sos.wa.gov) We have uploaded all records that are responsive to your request. Because this is new legislation and an emerging project, we have limited documentation related to the project and have received very limited communication from the secretary of state. You may access your records at the following link: ELECTION DATA REQUEST  - V024171-070524  Your request is now closed because we have searched all locations where responsive records are reasonably likely to be found. We have provided you with all responsive records. Because we do not intend to further address your request, the Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of our response to your request has started to run. Please feel free to contact me within 30 days.\u00a0 if you have any questions about your request, you believe additional responsive records have not been provided, or you need assistance accessing the records.

Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for information, that information is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the information is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort.  The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request.\r\n\r\nThe City is typically afforded ten (10 days) from the date of receipt of your request to make a determination whether your request seeks disclosable public records.  In accordance with the California Public Records Act, pursuant to Government Code section 7922.535(b), the City will require an extension of that deadline of up to an additional fourteen (14) days to make such a determination due to the following:\r\n\r\n1. The need to search for and collect the requested records from facilities separate from the office processing the request.\r\n2. The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.\r\n3. The need for consultation with another City department that has substantial interest in the response to the request.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the City will determine whether it possesses records responsive to your Request on or before November 2, 2023. If you have any questions regarding the City\u2019s response or would like to discuss your Request, please contact the City Clerk\u2019s Office at: city.clerk@cityofsanrafael.org<mailto:city.clerk@cityofsanrafael.org>\r\n\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBrenna Nurmi, CMC, CPMC | City of San Rafael\r\nDEPUTY CITY CLERK II\r\n1400 Fifth Avenue, Room 209\r\nSan Rafael, CA 94901\r\nOffice:  415.485.3066<tel:(415)%20485-3066>\r\n\r\n[Logo on White]",

The City redacted certain confidential investigatory information pursuant to Gov. Code \u00a7 7923.600(a). The City also redacted certain attorney-client communications which are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Gov. Code section 7927.705.  The City redacted certain personal and medical information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and/or violation of third party rights pursuant to Article 1, Section 1 of the California Constitution. (Gov. Code \u00a7 7927.700.)  Complainant identifying information has been redacted under the balancing test of the Public Records Act as the public interest in the nondisclosure of the complainant\u2019s personal information clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the unredacted record.  (Gov. Code section 7922.000); City of San Jose v. Superior Court (1999) 74 Cal. App. 4th 1008.)\r\n\r\nThe City is continuing to review records for responsiveness and privilege. Review is ongoing. The City will endeavor to provide the next batch of responsive records on or before 04/25/2024.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBrenna Nurmi, CMC, CPMC | City of San Rafael\r\nDEPUTY CITY CLERK II\r\n1400 Fifth Avenue, Room 209\r\nSan Rafael, CA 94901\r\nOffice:  415.485.3066<tel:(415)%20485-3066>\r\n\r\n[Logo on White]",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields. In particular, PDF has been noticed to obscure bcc and cc recipients, which may be seen as intentional. Please release in .csv as other Colorado organizations have chosen to do.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

A log of all emails to/from the CPS Title IX Officer, Camie Pratt, from May 1, 2024 - May 15, 2024. Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. \r\n\r\n2. Calendars for Camie Pratt, from January 1, 2024 - the date this FOIA is processed. \r\n\r\n3. Copies of reports filed via this link ( https://cps.guardianconduct.com/incident-reporting ) from April 1, 2024 - the date this FOIA is processed. RESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed your request and determined that, as currently written, it is unduly burdensome beyond the public interest in seeking numerous records maintained in multiple locations and which contain highly sensitive and exempt information that would require a timely and careful review. In order to respond to this request, the CPS FOIA Office would first be required to separately gather the requested calendar exports, gather all requested reports, and conduct an eDiscovery search to produce the requested email log. The FOIA Office has conducted a preliminary e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request, which yielded 1,995 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Title IX Officer\u2019s email account without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line content will contain, and sender and recipient lines are extremely likely to contain, student information, information reflecting the identity of parents communicating with their child\u2019s school, the identity of employees reporting Title IX matters, the identity of witnesses cooperating with Title IX investigations, details of pending investigations, exempt details of communications between a public body and its attorney, and personal email addresses or other highly personal information, which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the 1,995 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves and consultation with the Title IX Office in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Further, CPS receives hundreds of reports submitted via the link referenced in the request every month, and which are used to \u201creport an allegation of sex/gender-based discrimination, sex/gender-based harassment, sexual harassment (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking), sexual misconduct, [] retaliation \u2026 incidents of race, color, or national origin discrimination, discrimination based on another protected category, Bias Based Harm, Staff to Student Physical Abuse or Corporal Punishment, Retaliation, or Sports Inequity.\u201d Accordingly, producing five months\u2019 of the CPS Title IX Officer\u2019s calendar exports and seven weeks\u2019 worth of the reports sought in this request, which contain much of the same exempt information detailed above, would require the same timely review and consultation. Accordingly, gathering and reviewing the requested scope of records would require dozens of staff hours to review hundreds of individual records and lines of data, and therefore, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This is not a denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow this request, you may to specify a particular matter for which you seek records, limit the scope of the records sought, and/or limit the timeframe of the search. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including birth dates, personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, employee identification numbers, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, portions of records are exempt from release pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made and copies of reports filed at the referenced link have been withheld from disclosure pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) and 7(1)(n) of the FOIA as they have been determined to be factual information inextricably intertwined\u00a0with an ongoing\u00a0investigation or disciplinary proceeding. Section 7(1)(f) states \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)] Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" (Id. at 248, 799 N.E.2d at 864). Section 7(1)(n) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201cRecords relating to a public body's adjudication of employee grievances or disciplinary cases; however, this exemption shall not extend to the final outcome of cases in which discipline is imposed.\u201d Further, redactions have been applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

A log of all emails to/from the CPS Ethics Officer, from May 1, 2024 - May 15, 2024. Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. \r\n\r\n2. Calendars for Jennifer Chan, CPS Ethics Officer, from January 1, 2024 - the date this FOIA is processed. \r\nRESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed these portions of your request and determined that, as currently written, they are unduly burdensome beyond the public interest in seeking numerous records maintained in multiple locations and which contain highly sensitive and exempt information that would require a timely and careful review. In order to respond to this request, the CPS FOIA Office would first be required to separately gather the requested calendar exports and conduct an eDiscovery search to produce the requested email log. The FOIA Office has conducted a preliminary e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request, which yielded 1,241 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Ethics Officer\u2019s email account (the individual responsible for intaking and responding to ethics inquiries, submitted via email from any CPS official, employee, vendor, parent or member of the community) without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line and sender and recipient lines are extremely likely to contain personal email addresses, the identity of employees, parents, vendors, or members of the public witness to or reporting Ethics matters, exempt details of communications between a public body and its attorney, and details of pending investigations, which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the 1,241 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves and consultation with the Ethics Office in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Further, producing five months\u2019 of the CPS Ethics Officer\u2019s calendar exports is likely contain much of the same exempt information detailed above, and would require the same timely review and consultation. Accordingly, gathering and reviewing the requested scope of records would require dozens of staff hours and therefore, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest.

If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Alabama Open Records Law \u00a7 36-12-40 et seq..

In particular, I am requesting a single spreadsheet (with different sheets for each month) or a series of spreadsheets for each month with the following variables (where DEPARTMENT NAME == CDCR): \r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT NAME\r\nFACILITY NAME\r\nCOUNTY NAME\r\nLAST NAME\t\r\nFIRST NAME\r\nINT INDICATOR\r\nCLASSIFICATION TITLE\r\nCLASS TYPE\r\nCEA INDICATOR\r\nTIME BASE\r\nTENURE\r\nSALARY PER\r\nBASE SALARY\r\nON-LEAVE INDICATOR\r\nUNIQUE IDENTIFIER\r\nSAFETY MEMBER\r\nOASDI\r\nCBID\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).

E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Unfortunately, the \"playtime\r\nreport\" is just the data that's available within the i-ready system;\r\nthere's no option  within the software to export that data, nor do we have\r\naggregate data by school or district, just a YTD total of playtime minutes\r\nfor each class at each school. Putting that data into a shareable format\r\nwould involve manually tabulating data for each school. As per our\r\noriginal estimates this would be many many hours of staff time.\r\n\r\nNow that I better understand the software, I also took another look at the\r\nsample you'd provided from Warwick(?) schools; I see that they have some\r\ndata access included in their contract. I will find out if our contract\r\nprovides for the same, and we will reach out again to the vendor to see if\r\nthey have the ability to provide similar data for us. I'll let you know if\r\nthat pans out, and then you can decide how to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n*Thank you kindly,*\r\n\r\nRyan Vandehey\r\n\r\nPublic Records Officer & Media Relations Representative\r\n\r\nPortland Public Schools\r\nCommunications Department | Office of the Superintendent\r\n\r\nCell: 971-678-6103\r\n\r\nPronouns: he/him/his",

Guarino (DoB: 9/14/1967), the Sodexo operations manager assigned to MCC until February 2022.\r\n\r\n## Specific records\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following specific records:\r\n1.) Any communications with Sodexo regarding the lawsuit or Roger Guarino's status at MCC or the MCC Association.\r\n2.) Any communications between MCC, the MCC Association, or  Roger Guarino regarding the lawsuit or any steps taken by MCC or the MCC Association in response to the lawsuit.\r\n3.) Any communications with any other educational institution regarding Roger Guarino, including any communications with the University of Arkansas - Little Rock, where Sodexo reassigned Roger Guarino to another position that involved interacting with children despite being aware of the child molestation lawsuit.\r\n\r\n## Applicability of FOIL to the  MCC Association, Inc \r\n\r\nI contend that records maintained MCC Association, Inc, a non-profit associated MCC, are within the scope of the New York Freedom of Information Law. Such records constitute \"material received by a corporation providing services for a State university and kept on behalf of the university\" (Encore Coll v. Auxiliary Serv NY Court of Appeals (1995) 87 N.Y.2d 410,414) and are thus \"a record subject to disclosure under FOIL\" (id.).\r\n\r\n## Fees\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees in excess of $200, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdward",

The purpose of this letter is to ask that you clarify or narrow your request by providing us with more information about the particular records you seek. The following paragraph highlights the aspect of your request that we find to be unclear or overly broad. \r\n \r\nRegarding the second part of your request, please clarify what you mean by \u201cthe events of April 24, 2024\u201d. Are you referring to the protests that took place on campus? \r\n\r\nRegarding part 3 of your request, initial searches indicate that the responsive information would be voluminous. The time required to process this amount of information would result in a high cost for you and would likely take months to process. As such, we wish to discuss how the scope of your request might be narrowed to target some smaller set of records. \r\nFirst, if there is some specific information that you are looking for that may have been included in emails sent or received by the listed individuals, please describe that particular information so that we can conduct a targeted search for it. The more specific you can be about what you are looking for, the more quickly we can determine whether it exists and release it to you. \r\n\r\nIf there is not some specific information that you are looking for, then we ask that you consider providing more detail regarding the subject matter of your request. There are many aspects of the recent protests that these individuals communicated about (examples include student safety, safety of the public, free speech issues, University rules related to protests, student conduct matters, the involvement of people unconnected to UT Austin, etc.). Is there some specific aspect of the protests that you are looking for communications about? You can either provide a description of the subject matter in which you are interested or provide some keywords that we can search for within his emails. \r\n\r\nRegarding parts 4 and 5 of your request, please confirm whether \u201celected official\u201d includes federal officials in addition to members of Congress. If so, please specify so that we can locate those communications. Any additional detail you can provide about which \u201celected officials\u201d you intend to be included would be appreciated. Since we do not have a comprehensive list of them, they may be difficult to identify. \r\n \r\nPlease let us know how you wish to proceed.
