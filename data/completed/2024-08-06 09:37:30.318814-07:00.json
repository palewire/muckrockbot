Section 7.5(h) exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Records of discipline more than four years old are exempt from disclosure pursuant to section 7.5(q) of the FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7.5(q)), which exempts information prohibited from being disclosed by the Personnel Records Review Act [820 ILCS 40/0.01 et seq.]. 820 ILCS 40/8 of the Personnel Records Review Act states that \u201can employer shall review a personnel record before releasing information to a third party and, except when the release is ordered to a party in a legal action or arbitration, delete disciplinary reports, letters of reprimand, or other records of disciplinary action which are more than 4 years old.\u201d Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Certain incident report entries related to this request are being withheld entirely pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a). This section exempts from disclosure information specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing federal or State law. Specifically, the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, section 325 ILCS 5/1, states that all records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect or records concerning referrals under this Act and all records generated as a result of such reports or referrals, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except as specifically authorized by this Act or other applicable law; and 820 ILCS 40/13 of the Illinois Personnel Records Review Act, which prohibits the identification of individuals who are the subject of an unfounded DCFS report.

CORA requests processed by the City will not include any requests involving Sam Watson - requests for those responses would need to be sent directly to PD. We will be able to search emails and provide CORA responses from the City through this process, and we just wanted to clarify if that is what you were looking for before we begin. \r\n  \r\n If a response is not received in 7 days, your request will be considered closed. \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n Englewood City Clerk's Office\r\n1000 Englewood Parkway, 3rd Floor\r\nEnglewood, Colorado 80110\r\n303-762-2430\r\ncityclerk@englewoodco.gov \r\n  \r\n Full Request Details: \r\n  \r\n Field Name Response\r\nRequesterName Samuel Newton\r\nRequesterEmail 170013-02695370@requests.muckrock.com\r\nRequesterPhone not provided\r\nRequesterAddress 263 Huntington Ave\r\nRequesterCity Boston\r\nRequesterState MA\r\nRequesterZip 02115\r\nRepresentation MuckRock News\r\nCityRecordType Other/Multi\r\nIMSAcknowledgement false\r\nDescription Pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records: Pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA), I am requesting access to and a copy of the logs of all CORA requests submitted to your office over the past 180 days.

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

Please reference FOIA tracking number 2024-F-10372 in any future correspondence concerning this request.\r\n\r\nYou request the following:\r\n\r\nAll complaints concerning heat and high temperatures submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from farmworkers who work in greenhouses and plant nurseries between May 1, 2023, and the date that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that in order for DEP to process your request, NAICS code 111421 (nursery/ tree production), 111422 (floriculture production), 111998 (miscellaneous farming - including greenhouse, nursery & floriculture products) will be used to identify complaints in this sector.\r\n\r\nWe have an existing backlog of FOIA requests in queue received prior to yours, so there is an expected delay.  Additionally, all FOIAs are reviewed by the Office of the Solicitor prior to release, which may protract processing time.  Please keep these considerations in mind as you await your response.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril Streets\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\r\nDirectorate of Enforcement Programs (DEP)\r\nstreets.april@dol.gov",

Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam Levin",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of the determination on FOIL request DOCCS-23-07-235. The request yielded 12 pages, which consisted of a DOCCS Directive  8700, titled \"Community Preparation Case \u2013 Assignment and Release Investigation Process.\"\r\n\r\nDOCCS cited three FOIL statute exemptions in redacting the document. Among them is Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(g): \"inter/intra agency materials which are not final agency policy or decisions, statistical or factual tabulations, external audits, or instructions to staff that affect the public.\"\r\n\r\nAs a DOCCS directive, the document is by definition a final agency policy. Thus POL \u00a787(2)(g) does not apply. Thus I request that DOCCS:\r\n\r\n(a) itemize the redactions, explaining which FOIL statute exemption applies to each, and\r\n(b) unredact all portions of the document which cite POL \u00a787(2)(g) as the justification.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. My phone number is (419) 309-6331.\r\n\r\nSicnerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

You are seeking copies of Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs), Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), memoranda of agreement or other liaison, information sharing or prisoner/detainee transfer agreements or delegations of authority with or involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement signed or otherwise put into effect between March 1, 2003 and the present. \n\nA search of the U.S. Department of Justice, United States Marshals Service (USMS) for records responsive to your request produced records that originated from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).These records have been referred to ICE for review and processing under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nAfter review of the records, I have determined that 4 pages will be released in full and portions of 2 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA. The specific Exemptions applied are identified within the enclosed documents. Descriptions of those Exemptions are enclosed. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Fernando Pineiro Jr. at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination.\n",

Copies of video recordings have a fee of $48. All applicable fees must be paid prior to the copying. CPS will inform you of any fees due if your paper response exceeds 50 pages.

        "communication": "In response to the request below, records that are maintained by the House for the House/staff members listed in the request, i.e., email accounts and document drives, were searched for public records that meet the criteria of your request. Those searches yielded more than 1,600 emails. Before a response is provided, each record must be reviewed to determine whether it meets the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d found in s. 11.0431(4), F.S., is responsive to the request, or contains exempt or confidential information that must be redacted. Reviewing such a large number of records will require a significant use of House resources.\r\n\r\nThe estimated cost of reviewing and processing the emails alone is $264.92. At least 75% of the estimate ($198.69) must be received as an initial payment before we process the emails any further. If the actual cost of producing a response to your request is more than your initial payment, the difference must be paid before any records are released. If full payment is not received after the records are reviewed, the initial payment will not be refunded and the records will not be released. However, if the actual cost is less than your initial payment, the difference will be refunded and the records will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease note that partial responses will not be provided while we are reviewing and processing the records.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to proceed with the request as is, please reply so that we can provide additional payment information. If you wish to narrow or otherwise modify the request, please reply and provide specific search parameters for each part of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that chapter 119, F.S. does not apply to the legislative or judicial branches of Florida\u2019s state government.\r\n\r\nNo further action will be taken on this request until we hear from you.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nOffice of Open Government\r\nFlorida House of Representatives\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease Note: The Florida Constitution requires disclosure of public records unless a Florida Statute exempts the records from the disclosure requirement. Most emails to and from House members and staff that were sent or received in connection with the transaction of legislative business are public records that will be made available to the public and media upon request. Therefore, the contents of your email and your email address are subject to public disclosure unless a specific statute exempts them from the Constitution\u2019s disclosure requirements.\n",

Reporting can be done through our online reporting portal or by downloading, completing and then submitting FDA Form 3500 (Health Professional) or 3500B (Consumer/Patient) to MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. I am looking for:\r\n- The current database schema, data dictionary, or other reference document(s) to show how the FDA tracks these reports.\r\n - A database export or disaggregated data of reports submitted to this system since 2020.  If possible please include accompanying documentation submitted by the complainant. Please include the relevant fields releasable under the law. \r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs a reporter for the WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
