If any additional footage (such as surveillance or helicopter footage) exists and provides significant context to the events, I request access to those records as well.\r\n\r\nIf it helps to locate the desired incident, here's a news report: https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/bodycam-video-shows-arrest-of-4-suspects-in-fedex-driver-robbery/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
