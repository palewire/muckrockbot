This should include records with information about claims and notices of claim targeting SPD staff regardless of whether lawsuit was filed, as well as amounts paid in related settlements or verdicts.\r\n\r\nIn case it's helpful in identifying records, please note that someone else received similar records from your office, covering 1998 through mid-2013 (PDR# 13-112) and 2013 through 2017 (PDR C017518-090117).  Those are all published on the Web at <https://www.muckrock.com/foi/seattle-69/city-attorneys-tracking-of-legal-defense-of-police-officers-6838/#files> and <https://www.muckrock.com/foi/seattle-69/city-attorneys-tracking-of-legal-defense-of-police-officers-since-2013-42688/#files>.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRose Terse",
