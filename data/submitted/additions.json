Expedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nThe undersigned publishes a newsletter in anatoledo.substack.com and X articles under the handle @anatoledodavila. She currently has over 7,000 subscribers in both platforms and over 40,000 views per month. Pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466, she qualifies as a member of the news media that provides information of public interest to her subscribers. Thus the information sought is not deemed for commercial use. Id. Her status as a member of the media warrants the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed in the endeavors of disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5 (d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nThe records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.\u201d Id.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, the undersigned requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nIV. Request for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe undersigned hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2). Furthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as the undersigned will report the results of this endeavor as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, I request that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). \r\n\r\nThe Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nanaluda@proton.me\r\nT. 832-24-3047\r\nPO Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX 77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna Toledo",
