I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

A copy of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) bearing tracking number SED MOU: 018-015 between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the City University of New York - Asian American/Asian Research Institute (AAARI/CUNY). This MOU was signed by Joyce Moy, Executive Director of AAARI at CUNY, on August 2, 2018, and was countersigned by Elizabeth R. Berlin, Executive Deputy Commissioner of NYSED, on July 30, 2018.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of the amended MOU (Amendment #1) to the aforementioned MOU. This amended MOU was signed by Joyce Moy on February 13, 2020, and by Phyllis D. Morris, CFO of NYSED, on January 31, 2020.\r\n\r\n3. All communications, including but not limited to emails, letters, and memos, between the named signature parties (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris) related to the MOU and its amendment. Please note that email metadata, such as sender, recipient, date, and subject line, is considered responsive factual data and should be included in the disclosure, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\n4. All cash receipts, invoices, and payments received or disbursed related to the funds specified in the MOU and its amendment, as well as any related to the work product or completion of the MOU but borne by CUNY.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with third parties, subcontractors, or external entities to AAARI/CUNY related to the MOU and its amendment. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of any and all work product and interim work product viewed by outside parties, including NYSED, subcontractors, advisors, consultants, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the advisory opinions FOIL-AO-19160, FOIL-AO-18321, and FOIL-AO-17725, even if the content of certain communications is exempt from disclosure under POL \u00a787(2)(g), the factual information about the communication itself, such as the sender, recipient, date, and subject line, should still be disclosed. This metadata does not typically contain deliberative or advisory content, but rather factual information about the communication itself. Therefore, I request that this factual information be disclosed in response to my FOIL request, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\nI would like to highlight the urgency of this request in light of the ongoing legislative discussions around Senate Bill S1402, which seeks to amend education law in relation to culturally responsive education and curriculum. The records requested are directly relevant to the public understanding of the state's efforts in this area, particularly the work of NYSED and AAARI/CUNY under the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to remind you of the retention requirements under the New York State Archives' LGS-1 schedule. Records that are subject to a FOIL request must be retained until the request has been fully resolved, including any potential appeal process.\r\n\r\nIf any record has been denied in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the law. I expect the request to be filled within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGiven the relevance of these records to ongoing legislative discussions and public interest, I kindly request that you expedite the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance with this matter.\r\n\r\nNB: You can find reference to the MOU and Amendment Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_VK1ACtp.pdf and Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_Amended_4VCegX6.pdf respectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

I am writing in response to your letter dated June 14, 2023, acknowledging the receipt of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request, and the subsequent extension letter dated July 13, 2023.\r\n\r\nI understand that the City University of New York (CUNY) University Central Office is currently conducting a diligent search for the requested records. I appreciate your efforts in this regard and acknowledge the complexity of the task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential for delays in the process. To mitigate this, I kindly request a rolling release of documents as they are found and reviewed. This would allow me to begin reviewing the information that is readily available while you continue your search for the remaining records.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request for more specific parameters for items #3 and #5, I propose the following:\r\n\r\nFor item #3, let's limit the time period to August 1, 2018, through February 29, 2021, which covers the signing of the original MOU and its amendment. The search terms could include the names of the signatories (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris), \"MOU\", \"Amendment\", \"SED MOU: 018-015\", and \"NYSED\".\r\n\r\nFor item #5, the same time period and search terms could apply. As for specific individuals from AAARI/CUNY, I would suggest starting with Joyce Moy, as she signed both the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you acknowledge receipt of this response promptly and provide an updated timeline for when I can expect to receive the first batch of documents. I understand that these processes can take time, and I appreciate your commitment to ensuring a thorough review of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",

The officer asked for a specific time period, search terms, and specific individuals from \"AAARI/CUNY\" by COB June 28, 2023, or else CUNY University Central Office would deny requests #3 and #5 as overly broad.\r\n\r\nI believe this response constitutes an arbitrary denial of access and a willful attempt to avoid responding to my request. The deadline of June 28, 2023, appears to be an attempt to limit the scope of my request without conducting a detailed search, which is contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nMy original request, I believe, was reasonably described and in compliance with the FOIL. Furthermore, I have recently responded to the Records Access Officer's request for more specific parameters in a manner that is accommodating and within the bounds of reasonableness.\r\n\r\nI am appealing this decision on the grounds that it is a violation of the Freedom of Information Law, specifically Public Officers Law, Article 6, which guarantees the public's right to access government records.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that this appeal be reviewed promptly, and that the decision to impose an arbitrary deadline be reconsidered. I am also forwarding a copy of this appeal to the Committee on Open Government for their review.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

Original Request (June 7, 2023): Submitted as per the details outlined above.\r\n2. Acknowledgment and Request to Split (June 14, 2023): Agency acknowledged the request and asked for additional information for requests #3 and #5. The request to split was accepted, and additional information was provided.\r\n3. Administrative Closure and New Request (July 13, 2023): Requests #3 and #5 were administratively closed, and a new FOIL request was treated for those categories.\r\n4. Appeal (July 17, 2023): An appeal was filed, arguing against arbitrary denial of access.\r\n5. Response to Appeal (August 7, 2023): Appeal was denied, and the response provided detailed reasoning.\r\n6. Extension Letter (August 16, 2023): Extension until September 18, 2023, was notified.\r\n\r\nStatutory Timelines:\r\n- Response Deadline: The current response deadline is set for September 18, 2023.\r\n- Appeal Timeline: The appeal was filed and responded to within the statutory timelines.\r\n\r\nRequested Exemptions and Justifications:\r\n- Exemption for Delay: Justification provided was the need for additional time to review records for applicable exemptions, legal privileges, and responsiveness.\r\n\r\nCounterpoints to Exemptions:\r\n- Exemption for Delay:\r\n  - Counterpoint: While we understand the need for a thorough review, the extension should be reasonable and in line with the public's right to timely access. The specific reasons for the delay should be clearly articulated, and continuous updates should be provided.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that the agency adhere to the statutory timelines and provide a prompt and comprehensive response to the FOIL request. Should there be any further delays, exemptions, or denials, I request clear and detailed justifications in accordance with the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n",

        "communication": "This is an appeal of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's response to my July 1, 2020 multipart request for various records concerning various recently deceased Chicagoans. In particular, I appeal the FBI's determinations for the following parts of my request:\r\n\r\n1. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Sister Sheila Lyne (1936/1937 \u2013 March 10, 2020), a former Chicago health commissioner and CEO of Mercy Hospital\"\r\n3. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Roy Larson (1929/1930 \u2013 February 25, 2020), a former Chicago Sun-Times religion reporter, best known for his investigations of Cardinal John Cody\"\r\n6. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Barbara O\u2019Connor (April 28, 1930 \u2013 January 12, 2020), a well-known Hyde Park community activist\"\r\n7. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning John LaPlante (1940/1941 \u2013 March 21, 2020), Chicago\u2019s\u2019s first transportation commissioner\"\r\n8. \"[a]ll records and files, regardless of physical form, including cross-referenced documents and ELSUR records, concerning or mentioning Rosalie Clark (April 16, 1925 \u2013 June 26, 2020), Chicago\u2019s\u2019s director of protocol\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 6 of my request, related to Barbara O\u2019Connor, and assigned it FOIPA #1469797-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 7 of my request, related to John LaPlante, and assigned it FOIPA #1469856-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 8 of my request, related to Rosalie Clark, and assigned it FOIPA #1469870-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 21, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 1 of my request, related to Sister Sheila Lyne, and assigned it FOIPA #1469883-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\nIn a letter dated July 21, 2020, the FBI acknowledged Part 3 of my request, related to Roy Larson, and assigned it FOIPA #1470034-000. Additionally, they stated that they \"were unable to identify records responsive to [my] request.\"\r\n\r\nI appeal the integrity of the FBI's search to each of these parts of these requests. In particular, I specifically asked for a search outside of the CRS as well and it is unclear whether the FBI performed such a search. Lyne, LaPlante, and Clark were in or around City Hall during the time period of FBI investigations of high-ranking Chicago politicians and it is likely that their name appears, at minimum, as cross-references in such files. Larson was involved in investigations of Cardinal John Cody; as Cody was subject to several federal investigations during his time in Chicago, it is likely that Larson's name, at minimum, appears as cross-references in these files. O'Connor was a well-known Hyde Park political activist and helped elect Mayor Harold Washington and President Obama; her name potentially appears in the files of Chicago officials or politicians.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nShreyas Gandlur",

Please search all of her CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has conducted an e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request. This search yielded 2,550 search results. As written, it has been determined that your request is unduly burdensome to the District pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g). In order to comply with this request, the CPS would have to review each of the 2,550 lines of data, each of which may include student information, sender and recipient email addresses, and subject line content that would have to be\u00a0reviewed to determine if it is exempt from disclosure. Due to the job function of Ms. Arceo, this data contains a significant amount of personal information and student information contained in the subject line and sender and recipient lines, requiring a careful and timely review. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS. This is not a denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow your request, you may wish to narrow the timeframe of the search or specify a subject matter or keywords to filter the search by. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

His company is called Navy Yard Hospitality, I believe. \r\nI am interested in knowing if Massport has had any jurisdiction over the development of that site, including the gangway to the ship. \r\nThe City of Boston\u2019s Inspectional Services said it was not under their jurisdiction, and suggested I contact your office. \r\nI also know that the Project was done under the regulations for Massachusetts (Chapter 91). I am interested in any architectural drawings, Permit applications and Permits related to the gangway leading from the Pier up to the ship.\r\nPlease let me know if this is in your jurisdiction, and how I can get access to the building permit documents for that restaurant.\r\nThank You,\r\nVictor A. Popp, PE \r\n \r\nVPOPP Inc.\r\n75 Gardner St.; Hingham, MA 02043\r\n781-875-1085 Office\r\n781-264-7769 Cell Phone\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nVictor Popp, PE",

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to James Nathaniel Brown. Mr. Brown was an NFL running back for the Cleveland Browns, an actor, and a social justice activist. He was born on 17 February 1936 in St. Simons Island, GA, USA. He died on 18 May 2023. \r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Brown appeared in numerous national media, including NPR, https://www.npr.org/2023/05/19/1118051361/nfl-hall-of-fame-cleveland-browns-running-back-jim-brown-dead, the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/sports/football/im-brown-dead.html, and ESPN (see attached).\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n \r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Brown: \r\n\r\n(1) Negro Industrial Economic Union\r\n(2) Black Economic Union\r\n(3) Muhammad Ali / Cassius Clay\r\n(4) Nation of Islam\r\n(5) The Cleveland Summit\r\n(6) Amer-I-Can Foundation\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Brown has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Brown was a public figure. He is considered one of the best running backs and best NFL players of all time. In 2002, he was named by The Sporting News as the greatest professional football player ever. When Mr. Brown died last week, President Barack Obama wrote, \"I was too young to remember Jim Brown's playing days, but I knew his legacy. One of the greatest football players ever, he was also an actor and activist \u2013 speaking out on civil rights, and pushing other black athletes to do the same.\" Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Brown has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. The FBI is known to have surveilled Mr. Brown because of his activism critical of the U.S. government and the Vietnam War. Thus, the public has an significant interest in knowing how its government has surveilled those who oppose its policies.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion: \r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Virgil C.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Saulnier:\r\n\r\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) acknowledges receipt of your March 6, 2023 Public Access to Records Policy (PARP) request regarding Solicitation No. 0000008611 for the Bus Priority Violation Detection System.  Specifically, you requested the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Evaluation scores/notes related to ALL proposers\r\n  2.  Submitted responses of ALL proposers (with the exception of Verra Mobility)\r\n  3.  Debrief documents related to ALL proposers\r\n\r\nYour request is being processed pursuant to WMATA's Public Access to Records Policy (PARP).[1]\r\n\r\nPartial Decision\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.3 (exempt by statute - F.A.R. Section 24.202 - a proposal shall not be made available under the Freedom of Information Act unless it is incorporated into a contract) and PARP Exemption 6.1.4 (confidential commercial information), we deny all portions of your request that pertain to companies other than the successful offeror.  There is a difference between a successful and unsuccessful offer for a government contract in terms of expectation of confidentiality, and there is a stronger public interest in the disclosure of awarded contract information than unsuccessful proposals. See Raytheon Co. v. Dep't of Navy, No. CIV. A. 89-2481, 1989 WL 550581, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 22, 1989) (quoting Racal-Milgo Government Systems, Inc. v. Small Business Admin., 559 F. Supp. 4, 6 (D.D.C. 1981)).  Unsuccessful proposals are not incorporated in a final awarded contract, and thus, those records are withheld.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.5 (deliberative process privilege), bid evaluation documents are exempt from disclosure because they contain WMATA staff evaluations and recommendations regarding the proposals.  See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. General Services Admin., No. 89-0746, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3623 (D.D.C. 1992).\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not yet able to provide any responsive records, we can impart the following general information regarding your request:\r\n\r\nTime Period for Processing Requests\r\n\r\nWMATA generally aims to respond to a request for records within 20 business days following receipt of the request.  WMATA processes requests in the order that requests are received.  Furthermore, additional processing time is required for requests that prove to be complex.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that your request includes records submitted to WMATA by a third party, which requires us to contact the third party to identify confidential and proprietary information. WMATA will not release any records until it has had the opportunity to consult with the third party and received appropriate feedback.\r\n\r\nExemptions\r\n\r\nThe PARP provides exemptions for certain types of data, including: (1) information that could compromise WMATA infrastructure or security; (2) information that is solely related to the internal personnel rules and practices; (3) information that is exempt by statute; (4) proprietary commercial or financial information; (5) intra-agency and inter-agency memoranda information which would not be made available by law to a party in litigation with WMATA; (6) information that, if released, would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (7) certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes; (8) registered SmarTrip\u00ae information; and (9) customer financial information.  Generally, WMATA's response will not include any exempt information.\r\n\r\nProcessing Fees\r\n\r\nThe PARP also provides for the assessment of fees associated with a request that requires more than two hours of staff time to process.  These fees are calculated at the employees' basic rate of pay, plus an additional 50 percent to cover benefits. In general, a request is considered an agreement to pay all applicable fees.  Advance payment is required where the fees are likely to exceed $250. We will provide you an estimation of fees prior to the processing of any possible responsive records.\r\n\r\nAppeal Rights\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal WMATA's decision, in accordance with PARP \u00a7 9.1, you may file a written appeal of the action with the Executive Vice President, External Relations (or designee) at PARP_Appeal@wmata.com<mailto:PARP_Appeal@wmata.com>, within 30 business days of the date of this decision letter.  Further details about our appeals process can be found on our website.\r\n\r\nFuture correspondence should reference the request number noted in the subject line of this correspondence. If you have any questions, please contact me, if I am unavailable, you may contact Richard Noh at RDNoh@wmata.com<mailto:RDNoh@wmata.com> or 202-962-2569.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Yanos\r\n\r\n[1] The PARP can be found on WMATA's website at https://www.wmata.com/about/records/public-records.cfm, under the section marked \"Legal Affairs.\"\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D962E7.2AEFB420]\r\n\r\nBrian J.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Saulnier:\r\n\r\nThis is the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) final decision in response to your March 6, 2023, Public Access to Records Policy (PARP) request regarding Solicitation No. 0000008611 for the Bus Priority Violation Detection System.  Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  \"Evaluation scores/notes related to ALL proposers\r\n  2.  Submitted responses of ALL proposers (with the exception of Verra Mobility)\r\n  3.  Debrief documents related to ALL proposers\"\r\n\r\nYour request was processed pursuant to WMATA's PARP.[1]\r\n\r\nPrevious Partial Decision\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 2023, WMATA denied all portions of your request that pertain to companies other than the successful offeror pursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.3 (exempt by statute - F.A.R. Section 24.202 - a proposal shall not be made available under the Freedom of Information Act unless it is incorporated into a contract) and PARP Exemption 6.1.4 (confidential commercial information).  WMATA also denied Part 1 of your request pursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.5 (deliberative process privilege).\r\n\r\nDecision\r\n\r\nPlease find attached the following records responsive to the remainder of your request (133 pages total):\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  COBTR222155 Hayden AI Successful Proposal (133 pages).\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.4 (confidential commercial information), we have redacted business proprietary information that our contractor customarily and actually treats as confidential.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.5 (deliberative process privilege & self-evaluative privilege), we have redacted observations, evaluations, and determinations that were issued to help WMATA make a final decision.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.6 (personal privacy), we have redacted personal information of individuals whose privacy interests outweigh the public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nAfter a search reasonably calculated to find all relevant records, WMATA has found no additional records responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nProcessing Fees\r\n\r\nWMATA spent more than 2 hours of staff time processing the records responsive to your request, which would normally result in processing fees which you would be responsible for.  However, the processing time was divided among the number of requesters seeking similar records, and as a result, the assessed processing time for this request is less than two hours.  Accordingly, pursuant to PARP \u00a7 8.5, the processing fees are waived.\r\n\r\nAppeal Rights\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal WMATA's decision, in accordance with PARP \u00a7 9.1, you may file a written appeal of the action with the Executive Vice President, External Relations (or designee) at PARP_Appeal@wmata.com<mailto:PARP_Appeal@wmata.com>, within 30 business days of the date of this decision letter.  Further details about our appeals process can be found on our website.\r\n\r\nFuture correspondence should reference the request number noted in the subject line of this correspondence. If you have any questions, please contact me, if I am unavailable, you may contact Richard Noh at RDNoh@wmata.com<mailto:RDNoh@wmata.com> or 202-962-2569.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Yanos\r\n\r\n[1] The PARP can be found on WMATA's website at https://www.wmata.com/about/records/public-records.cfm, under the section marked \"Legal Affairs.\"\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA003F.2D5DC2B0]\r\n\r\nBrian J.

Now that you've registered with Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging, communicating securely is easy!\r\n\r\nAs you know, Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging protects our confidential correspondences by using the same security technologies as internet banking when sending and receiving sensitive email messages. But you likely didn't know that this service allows you to do so much more than address security and compliance, or guarantee delivery of messages that prevent statements such as \"I never received it\".\r\n\r\nVillage of Fox Lake Secure Messaging includes a patented Delivery Slip - a powerful tool for users that provides many features for increased efficiencies and control over sensitive messages and attachments. It is found on the right side of  all secure message, both in this Secure Message Center and your desktop Microsoft Outlook program ('Enable with MS Office Outlook').\r\n\r\n5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip\r\n\r\nHere's just 5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip that you probably never thought possible with basic email:\r\n\r\n1. Know what happens to your secure message once it's sent. Track and prove when a secure message and attachment is received, read, replied to, forwarded, deleted or printed.\r\n\r\n2. Send jumbo files via email. Now you can simply attach that 100 MB file to a message without having to find an external service to share it.\r\n\r\n3. Completely recall a secure message - and it works! Now you can instantly retract a secure message and attachment - even days or weeks after the recipient has read the message - resulting in the recipient's inability to access or read the recalled secure message.\r\n\r\n4. Prevent a recipient from forwarding or replying to a secure message; or prevent a recipient from printing or saving a message or attachment.\r\n\r\n5. Add extra security for ultra-sensitive content with 'For Your Eyes Only' by including an additional password required for the message or attachment to be opened by the recipient. Also prevents internal or external access by email delegates.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the benefits of  Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging unique features: http://www.appriver.com/\r\n\r\nThank you, and we're glad to have you as part of Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging!\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n--------------- BEGIN E-MAIL2 SIGNATURE ---------------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\r\n\r\n--------------- END E-MAIL2 SIGNATURE ---------------",

Mdtazwar Hasan as a subject. For specificity and to rule out duplicates, Mdtazwar Hasan was arrested on July 23, 2022 in the confines of the 107 Precinct in the County of Queens, New York.\r\n\r\nDivisions that may hold responsive records include Internal Affairs, Employment Management, and Department Advocate's Office; however, any record used to evaluate performance toward the subject's continued employment or promotion should be considered responsive.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Law as amended by Chapter 96 of the Laws of New York of 2020, records that may be released include \"the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee; the name of the employee complained of or charged; the transcript of any disciplinary trial or hearing, including any exhibits introduced at such trial or hearing; the disposition of any disciplinary proceeding; and the final written opinion or memorandum supporting the disposition and discipline imposed including the agency's complete factual findings and its analysis of the conduct and appropriate discipline of the covered employee.\"\r\n\r\nUnder precedent, Freedom of Information Law uses a \"balancing test\" method of weighing privacy interests favoring redaction/denial against the public interest in favor of disclosure. This matter is of clear public interest for the following reasons: P.O. Mdtazwar Hasan has been publicly accused of engaging in an off-duty act of domestic violence in the County of Queens: https://bronx.com/nypd-police-officer-mdtazwar-hasan-24-arrested-2/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

News reports say University and city police responded to the campus at about 11:15 p.m on April 10th after police received three calls stating a shooter was in the Hillman Library on Forbes Avenue. In one call, the sound of gunshots was heard in the background, Pitt Police Chief Jim Loftus told reporters. \r\n\r\nI am looking for the audio of these calls as well as any after action reports, incident reports, investigative reports, call detail logs and body camera footage of officers responding to this incident.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

Please also redact the identities of the prior owners of forfeited property.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned Public Records Request Number 23-18.\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of gathering, identifying, and reviewing responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that we have the records for calendar years 2015 through 2022 available in electronic format. The records for calendar years 2013 and 2014 currently exist only in paper form.\r\n\r\nThere will be a fee for converting the 2013-2014 records to an electronic format. The total cost will be based on the number of records to be scanned. We estimate that the charge for those records will be $120, although the final charge will be based on the actual number of records that are scanned.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm whether you want us to proceed with the production for the years 2013 and 2014.\u00a0We will provide the total cost before we begin scanning and collect payment at that time.\r\n\r\nWe estimate that there will be approximately 4,800 pages of responsive records for 2015-2022, and approximately 1,200 pages for 2013-2014. You requested that we redact the names of prior owners which adds to the processing time. Accordingly, we will provide the records in installments. We estimate the first installment will be available on or before May 21, 2023. We will continue to provide installments every 30 days with an estimated completion date of August 18, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please contact me directly through this Public Records Request portal, or by calling (360) 902-8907.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJilene Siegel\r\n\r\nOST Public Records Officer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Washington State Treasurer.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

While reviewing and preparing records for the first installment, I learned that some, but not all, of the 2015 paper reports have been scanned. (Converting the records from paper to electronic format is currently a work-in-progress that began earlier this year. After some of the 2015 reports were scanned, it was noted that 2015 was beyond the retention period. The decision was made at that time to discontinue scanning the records for calendar year 2015 and earlier.)\r\n\r\nBased on your request to limit our response to records that exist in electronic format, we will provide the 2015 records that were previously scanned, but we won\u2019t scan additional 2015 paper records.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, please let me know if you prefer that we exclude all 2015 reports, but it may impact how quickly we are able to provide our full response. Because the conversion is a work in progress, many of the files clearly identify the reporting period in the filename, so we could easily exclude those 2015 reports. Many other files currently include multiple reporting periods, so we would need to review each page in those files to remove the 2015 reports.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to call me if you\u2019d like to discuss these options further.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJilene Siegel\r\n\r\nOST Public Records Officer\r\n\r\n(360) 902-8907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Washington State Treasurer.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year. \n\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d \n\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE: \n\n1.
