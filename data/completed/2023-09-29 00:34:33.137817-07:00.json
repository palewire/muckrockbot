Please specifically task a search for C. Martinez and Joshua Farnkopf, Esq., as well as any FOIA talkers and responses sent or received by ICE FOIA between February 23, 2023, and April 5, 2023. Your request was received in this office on 4/6/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.

My request was assigned the number 23-01724-FOIA and placed in your complex processing queue.\r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing of my FOIA request in accordance with the U.S. Department of Justice's guidelines for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nImminent Threat to Life or Physical Safety: The V-safe program is directly related to the monitoring of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. Given the ongoing pandemic and the critical nature of vaccine safety, timely access to this information could be life-saving for individuals considering vaccination.\r\n\r\nUrgency to Inform the Public: The V-safe program involves actual federal government activity that is of urgent concern to the public. The sooner this information is released, the sooner the public can make informed decisions about their health.\r\n\r\nWidespread and Exceptional Media Interest: The COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts are subjects of exceptional media interest. The integrity of the V-safe program and how it has been managed could significantly affect public confidence in the government's handling of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nGiven these compelling reasons, I also request a rolling release of records as they become available. This would serve the public interest by providing critical information as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n",

Dear Anthony Moser, On behalf of the Office of the Mayor, I am responding to your Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request which was dated September 19, 2023 and received in our office on the same day. At this time, the Office of the Mayor\u00a0is seeking an extension of five additional working days to respond to the requests for one or more of the following reasons identified in 5 ILCS 140/3(e) of FOIA: (xx) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records; (\u00a0 ) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; (\u00a0 ) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it; (\u00a0 ) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; (xx) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of the FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions; (\u00a0 ) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by 5 ILCS 140/3(d) without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body; (xx) there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request.

Dear Anthony Moser, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on September 19, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on September 27, 2023. You requested: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nRecords sufficient to show the calendar entries for Chief of Staff Rich Giudice for the months of August 2023 and September 2023 to date. Please include entries from any/all calendars associated with Rich Giudice, not limited to his primary email account. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAnthony Moser \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmayors-office-885%252Fcos-rich-giudice-calendar-152189%252F%253Femail%253DMOfoia%252540cityofchicago.org&url_auth_token=AAAVakss4kqDBu4naYY4htHES6U%3A1qioKt%3AOK5f73qJG_CutvwFczgLwvfrDgzyUZJON--8vvAI3UY\" \r\nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. We have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \r\n\r\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \r\n\r\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is access codes.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \r\nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \r\n\r\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nWe have redacted the identity of job applicants under Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 Individuals who go through an application process or examination process to attain a certain job or position have an expectation that this information would not be publicly disseminated if they are unsuccessful in attaining the position.\u00a0 In 2011 PAC 13060, the PAC cited to an earlier decision to explain why release of all information relating to all unsuccessful applicants is exempt.\u00a0 The PAC stated, \u201c\u2026the fact that an individual is seeking new employment for a position is information that a reasonable person would view as highly personal and the release of that information is likely to be viewed as objectionable by most individuals.\u00a0 Publication of an individual\u2019s application for a position can negatively impact that individual\u2019s current employment\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 Also, in 2010 PAC 6243, the PAC held that the names of applicants who completed the Firefighter/EMT exam are exempt pursuant to Section 7(1)(c).\u00a0 Thus, the Mayor's Office has properly redacted the identity of job applicants under Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844. Sincerely, Thomas Skelton \r\nFOIA Officer \r\nMayor's Office",

I recognize the need to balance the burden of fulfilling the request and the public interest in the information. While the latter side of the ledger is difficult to estimate as precisely as you have the former, I would note that the Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance represents the most expansive labor standard of its kind. Along with a handful of other cities and one state, Chicago has established the most significant new rights and protections on working time since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. My research seeks to understand the development and implementation of fair workweek laws, a project in which the National Science Foundation found sufficient merit to award me a competitive research fellowship (#2203815).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable public interest in this information, I am willing to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciate your continued assistance and look forward to your response to this narrowed request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management & Labor Relations",

Dear Peter Fugiel, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on June 06, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on June 13, 2023. You requested: \"Requesting to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\" \nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \n\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \n\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is personal email addresses and personal phone numbers.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \nWe have redacted under Section 7(1)(c) City issued cell phone numbers.\u00a0 As publicly-available City issued cell phone numbers would subject these employees to invasive and unsolicited communications, the disclosure of this information would burden employees\u2019 privacy interest. Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v. U.S. Department of the Navy, Case No. 14-cv-2115-BEN, 2016 WL 4801335 at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2016) (affirming the redaction of an employee\u2019s cell phone number, because \u201cthe [employee\u2019s] privacy rights in this information outweigh the public\u2019s interest in disclosure\u201d).\u201d \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that the deliberative process exemption under FOIA focuses on documents that reflect \u201cadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d NLRB v. Sears and Roebuck, 421 U.S. 132, 150-151 (1975).\u00a0 The purpose is to encourage \u201cfrank discussion of legal or policy matters\u201d such that employees in government feel free to express their opinions before a final legal or policy decision is made. \u201cDeliberative\u201d has been found to mean being a direct part of the process where recommendations and opinions are expressed. Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-44 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Records where preliminary opinions are expressed and policies and actions are formulated are therefore exempt from production under Section 7(1)(f) of the Illinois FOIA, and have been properly redacted and withheld. \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(m) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nCommunications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m).\u00a0 Because the redacted and withheld records constituted privileged communications between an attorney and clients, they have been properly redacted and withheld under this section. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

I have a couple of clarifying questions to be sure that these are the entirely of the records responsive to my request. \r\n\r\nFirst, would you confirm that only one email (with the subject \"Students Demand Action & Wisconsin Preemption - The DMO Digest\") was sent or received by Mayor Emanuel during the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019? For context, the Committee on Workforce Development and Audit, then chaired by Mayor Emanuel's floor leader Patrick O'Connor, held multiple meetings on the proposed Fair Workweek Ordinance in April 2018. Am I to understand that your search return no emails updating Mayor Emanuel of the status of this proposal in the final months of his term in office?\r\n\r\nSecond, could you clarify why certain email attachments (\"Fair Workweek City Comparison 7.20.docx\" and \"BRIEF_0726_Osterman briefing.docx\") were not included in the records provided? It is not clear to me that a document comparing provisions of existing fair workweek laws meets any of the statutory requirements for exemption. The laws are public, so why would a document quoting/summarizing them be withheld? Similarly, I don't understand why a briefing document mentioning fair workweek would not be subject to disclosure now that the law has been enacted and Alderman Osterman and Mayor Lightfoot have left office.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any clarification or additional records you can provide at this time. Given the considerable public interest in the Mayors' leadership around this major piece of policy, I may need to submit additional requests if this one is too narrow to yield relevant records, e.g. from the Emanuel administration.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued attention to this matter,\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the Agency contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request productions of all emails in native MICROSOFT .pst (personal storage table) format which allows for a virtually infinite number of emails to be produced in a single digital file, providing for economy and convenience. If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled into a single digital .pdf file.\r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available, or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully I decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite me to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

You will be asked to verify your email address and request a code in order to open the folder. This is a security feature that I am not able to override. If you are unable to receive a verification link email at 150701-33137398@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:150701-33137398@requests.muckrock.com> or do not find a code in your junk/span folder,  please provide another email address where you are able to receive the verification code.

However, King County did not review or produce Rhonda Berry's records for that request after the customer withdrew that portion of the request due to labor union objections to the release.\r\n\u200b\r\nOur preliminary estimate is that researching, reviewing and producing Rhonda Berry's email records could take multiple installments over the course of 5 or more years. Unlike the other employees listed, Berry was not an employee of the Department of Local Services - Permitting Division (formerly DPER.) The department director, John Starbard, reported to Berry, but she was not involved in the day-to-day work of the division.\r\n\u200b\r\n\u200bIn order to process these request items efficiently and expediently, please provide information for the following questions regarding Rhonda Berry's email records:\r\n\r\n  *   Are you seeking Berry's email records regarding specific permits and/or code enforcement cases?\r\n  *   Are you seeking records from a more specific time frame or date range?\r\n  *   Are you seeking Berry's email records sent to/from particular staff members, or departments?\r\n  *   Can you identify subjects or key words to help us locate the records you are seeking?\r\nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience about which types of Rhonda Berry records you are seeking.\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are currently gathering and reviewing records responsive to the remaining portions of your request, for the records of other employees that you listed. We anticipate providing you an installment of responsive records on approximately 09/26/2023.\r\n\u200b\r\nSincerely,\r\nGreg Felton\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nDLS-Permitting Division\r\nGreg.Felton@kingcounty.gov",

However, King County did not review or produce Rhonda Berry's records for that request after the customer withdrew that portion of the request due to labor union objections to the release. Our preliminary estimate is that researching, reviewing and producing Rhonda Berry's email records could take multiple installments over the course of 5 or more years. Berry was not an employee of the Department of Local Services - Permitting Division (formerly DPER.) The department director, John Starbard, reported to Berry, but she was not involved in the day-to-day work of the division. In order to process these request items efficiently and expediently, please provide information for the following questions regarding Rhonda Berry's email records: \r\n \r\n  *  Are you seeking Berry's email records regarding specific permits and/or code enforcement cases? \r\n  *  Are you seeking records from a more specific time frame or date range? \r\n  *  Are you seeking Berry's email records sent to/from particular staff members, or departments? Can you identify subjects or key words to help us locate the records you are seeking? Please contact me at your earliest convenience about which types of Rhonda Berry records you are seeking. We are currently gathering and reviewing records responsive to the remaining portions of your request, for the records of other employees that you listed. We anticipate providing you an installment of responsive records on approximately 09/26/2023. Sincerely, Greg Felton Public Records Officer DLS-Permitting Division  To monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Public Records Request System (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6HtRfOYLt5fXvpttM-2FU1HbCEvhyJajy29FOdQx-2FGVwa3heKW32oH6xOd0YvjOzCmm-2FiWbSEPJXEM9nE4rjPMHZ6jzFDDMRvkCY-2FQ0iWSMX0WdIxNqpirAEkY55GPE0kTCuQK9-2B1qnGR6EUQ15RblIQ-3D-3Dkoqy_-2BlMpHnWfZ0khxV1RaZbZ4mGtXSldq7B-2FTzCnSv7K7KoHdkME1saqlyIiN8fKohQ9rlvO-2BgPuCmBp1hrNfhLgKnGnH6KGYA4U8z1TytajrtEQ-2FXqkb5WAVOKYMdwViZCc5H3-2FnIqDG-2F50UAJLUUxlJOg-2Ftl6A6QHhZUOXD-2B3w3RmzwTrFpwMMu8oNJ6aY6Ic7fcAQ3HsMlLcUKb-2FYJqZoxvtgcc2tAku1Pa0SxRGwIksGsxdTBlCxH2IF-2FLdi4q3NJD7Wyj1SDr3QwgXnMO8qXprOb34UHqIT9Cg3VFeuhoXFbngK1nqVWcJpi-2FpczFEOT134H9Mm6fNMEkv3IojzRqPMtrLTpKtly-2FCdMg9MM1cM0sp3Rk0w9gYVuTTi1ym8YbEAXhC6U6tCmsFFkZPo8A-3D-3D)",

Of the thirty three (33) total installments you reference we have received \u201cPROD016,\u201d \u201cPROD017,\u201d \u201cPROD018\u201d and \u201cPreDISCOInstallments.\u201d The numbered installments seem self explanatory, the PreDISCOInstallments file requires explanation. Is the PreDISCOInstallments file 1 of the 33 total files?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is a little complicated and my keeping the original naming convention did not make it very clear. My record shows that there were 38 installments of records produced in response to the 2016 request. Of the 38 installments, 5 were produced by staff and the next 33 were produced with the assistance of the Discovery database. Each one of the installments from Discovery was labeled a production, or PROD. (So PROD 001 from Discovery was actually installment 6, overall.) The file labeled \u201cPreDISCOInstallments\u201d contains the records produced in the first 5 installments, prior to King County using the Discovery database to review and produce later installments. The database manufacturer refers to their software as \u201cDISCO,\u201d which I used when naming that file. So in actuality you will receive 33 \u201cproduction\u201d files and the file named \u201cPreDISCOInstallments\u201d for a total of 34 separate files.\r\n\r\nI could have renamed the PROD files to make it simpler, but keeping the original PROD names helped me stay organized and recognize the gaps in the records that I have available to me. We are still gathering the remaining productions from the DISCO database and I hope to get another batch to you within the next week.  I want to add that I did not receive a 9/7 email from you, so I apologize for the delay in responding to you. I don\u2019t see a message in a junk folder so I\u2019m not sure what happened. Fortunately, it appears  that you are able to receive email messages from me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGreg Felton | Public Records Officer | 206-477-3240\r\nKing County Department of Local Services, Permitting Division\r\n\r\n[horiz_transbg]\r\nClick this link for Customer Service Information<https://kingcounty.gov/depts/local-services/~/media/E7A09AA78A454D439FDCE325ADE477B2.ashx>\r\nStaff are working remotely.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAldo Romeo Luigi Moro (23 September 1916 \u2013 9 May 1978) was an Italian statesman and politician, and a prominent member of the Christian Democracy party. He served as 38th Prime Minister of Italy, from 1963 to 1968, and then from 1974 to 1976. He was one of Italy's longest-serving post-war Prime Ministers, holding power for a combined total of more than seven years.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as his death has been widely reported on:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/aldo-moro-found-dead\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/08/aldo-moro-red-brigades-1978\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581425/US-envoy-admits-role-in-Aldo-Moro-killing.html\r\n\r\nIn addition please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoseph Lloyd",

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) regulations at 32 CFR Part 2002 apply to all executive branch agencies that designate or handle information that meets the standards for CUI.\r\n\r\nI'm working on FOIA request NLRB-2023-001998 for \"all non-exempt fields of the participant and participant_party tables from the NxGen case management system database.\"\r\n\r\nNxGen designates participants to have one of four roles:\r\n\r\n  *   Primary: This is usually the main address of the facility as designated on the charge or petition\r\n  *   Legal Rep: Legal representation for the primary participant\r\n  *   Additional Service: These are people who would be like a cc in letters,  or it could be a secondary address for someone.  For example: many union reps list their official business address as primary, and because they might be located in a remote area or working from home, they have a secondary address or home address listed as an additional service.\r\n  *   Notification: This are the national or international union headquarters.  To become a notification, the organization has to file Form 4702 annually, and the notification party only receives a copy of the charge or petition.\r\n\r\nParticipants also have distinct roles: Employer, Union, Individual, and Union as an Employer.\r\n\r\nNxGen further designates participants as: Charging Party, Charged Party/Respondent, Involved Party, Petitioner, Intervenor, Employer, and Amicus.\r\n\r\nInstead of providing a dump of all the participants in the system, and in order to provide the most relevant case information, my recommendation for participants is to provide the Primary participant information (entity name and address) and exclude the Legal Reps, Additional Services, and Notifications.  Also, because the participant tables do not contain any other case-specific information besides the case number, I would recommend including the case name, date filed, date closed, and case closing reason.  I also recommend information for individual charging parties/petitioners be listed simply as the party type of \"Individual\" and to exclude individuals' personal address  information from your request (we would withheld it per Exemptions 6 and 7(C) if it's not specifically excluded.)  Further, I would also recommend excluding Amicus information since cases can only have Amicus filings if the Board approves it.\r\n\r\nSample R case info:\r\nCase Number\r\nCase Name\r\nCase Filed Date\r\nCase Closed Date\r\nClosed Reason\r\nDispute/Unit State\r\nDispute/Unit City\r\nEmployer Type\r\nEmployer Account Name\r\nEmployer Address1\r\nEmployer Address Address2\r\nEmployer Address City\r\nEmployer Address State\r\nEmployer Address Zipcode\r\nPetitioner Party Type\r\nPetitioner\r\nPetitioner Address1\r\nPetitioner Address2\r\nPetitioner Address City\r\nPetitioner Address State\r\nPetitioner Address Zipcode\r\nUnion Involved Party Type\r\nUnion Involved\r\nUnion Involved Address1\r\nUnion Involved Address2\r\nUnion Involved City\r\nUnion Involved State\r\nUnion Involved Zipcode\r\n09-RC-324532\r\nDunkin' Donuts\r\n08/25/2023\r\n\r\n\r\nOH\r\nCincinnati\r\nEmployer\r\nDunkin' Donuts\r\n850 Eastgate North Drive\r\n\r\nCincinnati\r\nOH\r\n45245\r\nUnion\r\nBakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, Local 57, AFL-CIO, CLC\r\n871 West Marion Road, Suite 202\r\n\r\nMt.

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request. Fee Category and Fee \r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Epstein's date of birth was January 20, 1953 . The first 5 digits of his Social Security Number were 090-44.\r\n\r\nInclude all records related to at least two aircraft known to be connected to Epstein: N908JE (registered to JEGE INC) ; N909JE (registration unknown); and N212JE (registered to JEGE LLC and PLAN D LLC).  Include all inquiries to the FAA and answers from the FAA for information requests on Epstein or the listed aircraft from a U.S. Cabinet Department (e.g., Department of Justice),  federal agency (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation), or from a state or local law enforcement agency (e.g., NYPD).\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies. FAA systems of records of interest include (but are not limited to): DOT/FAA 801 \u2013 Aircraft Registration Records; DOT/FAA 813 - Civil Aviation Security System; DOT/FAA 815 - Investigative Record System; DOT/FAA 845 - Administrators Correspondence Control and Hotline Information System, ACCIS, Administrator\u2019s Hotline Information System, AHIS, and Consumer Hotline Information System, CHIS; and DOT/FAA 847 - Aviation Records on Individuals. \r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that FAA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nEPSTEIN is widely reported to have died 8/10/2019 in New York City (see attached article from the NY Times). Records concerning Epstein as a subject should thus be assumed free from FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Sir or Madam:\r\n\r\nThere are several issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, what you are requesting is a very, very large search.  All records pertaining to Sea Launch, it\u2019s license, safety inspections, etc. is potentially thousands of dollars in search and review.  To the extent we can narrow down \u201call records mentioning or pertaining to\u201d on this licensee, that would help.\r\n\r\nSecondly, many of the records are physical, and again the search and duplication required will be substantial. In addition, our offices are currently closed to non-essential personnel due to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nOn the environmental documents, many of those were formally publicly available, so we are moving those to FAA FOIA Library.  When they are online, we can let you know.  There is no charge for those.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would be unable to find responsive records in the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a system run by NASA.  ASRS records are voluntary reported and de-identified before they arrive to FAA systems.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to modify the scope, we will conduct a full estimate of the cost of the search for your review and approval.\r\n\r\nI have found that when working with the public, media, and others on scope issues, it\u2019s a lot easier to have conversation about it, and then follow up with an email for the record.  If you would like to do that, I\u2019m happy to talk.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Rushforth\r\nChief of Staff\r\nOffice of Commercial Space Transportation\r\nFederal Aviation Administration\r\n(202) 267-9617",

        "communication": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI recently did a google search of city of Chicago search warrants and came across your FOIA request from the city of Chicago. \r\n\r\nMy daughter was a victim of the Chicago police because of the way they obtained the search warrant.\r\n\r\nIs there a way you can please help me get all the actual complaints for search warrants and search warrants that involve the 25th and 14th districts in Chicago, IL.\r\n\r\nThe officers involved were Ivan Ramos who is a sergeant who approved the warrants. (37 year old who was promoted by merit votes who runs a tactical team) Samantha Grazziano who wrote the complaint for the warrant (4 year police officer who is on a tactical team) and judge Ursula Walowski who signed the warrant. \r\n\r\nIvan ramos gets most of his warrants signed by Judge  Ursula Walowski who lives in the northwest side of Chicago where a lot of Chicago cops live. Her son goes to a private catholic school named St. Thecla where many Chicago police officers children attend as well.\r\n\r\nSamantha Grazziano who wrote the complaint for the search warrant lives about 2 miles from the judge Ursula Walowski.\r\n\r\nSamantha Grazziano\u2019s best friend who is also a Chicago police officer mother who was a Chicago police officer Elizabeth Mcghee lives like 4 blocks away from Judge Ursula Walowski.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any concrete proof as of yet about how they conspire but I have a feeling that either Ursula Walowski is rubber stamping the search warrants or the officers are forging her signature.\r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s kind of unbelievable but I do have proof that is public record of an officer that was forging Judge Ursula Walowski\u2019s signature so that he would be approved overtime hours that he never worked for.\r\n\r\nCan you please get back to me as I\u2019m in desperate need to gather proof that would help my daughters case so she can be set free.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDominick P.\r\nSent from my iPhone",

The LBPD responded by providing a PDF with two columns (city and zip code) and a row for each officer. The LBPD data shows 81.5% of officers commute from outside Long Beach\u2014many from Covid-19 hotspot in Orange County and one from as far away as Texas. \r\n\r\nThis request is in line with the precedent the ACLU and LA Times have established with the LAPD's public records department.  If you prefer not to make a seperate list, I will accept a redacted copy of the LBFD call-out roster or other such document. \r\n\r\nThe requested data will be made available to the general public and will appear in the Beachcomber and other media outlets as part of their reporting on the Public Safety Unions' opposition to Covid-19 public health measures. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGreg Buhl",

See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including but not limited to student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including but not limited to student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSonny Albarado, a citizen of Arkansas, in coordination with Anne Marie Tamburro.",

This was one of first FOIA requests I submitted through the Muckrock platform so  did not pay close attention to what was included. \r\n\r\nAs for a date range, my goal is not to set a range too big that the job is unmanageable and takes forever.  Also, I don't know what the agency may have, etc.\r\n\r\nLet's begin with date range from 1/1/2010 to the present, 7/18/2021 or whatever date I submitted the initial request.\r\n\r\nHopefully this date range is not too wide. If it is too big a time period - it would sweep in thousands of unrelated documents perhaps - let me know and I'll be glad to refine my request. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nSpencer",
