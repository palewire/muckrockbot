Mayor Adams served with the department from 1984 to 2006. I am requesting the following records under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL):\r\n\r\nAll records related to disciplinary actions taken against Eric Adams during his time with the New York City Police Department, including disciplinary files and logs.\r\n\r\nAny and all records related to changes, edits, and copies of the responsive documents identified in item 1 above.\r\n\r\nA list of all individuals who had access to the records identified in items 1 and 2 above during Eric Adams' tenure with the New York City Police Department.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the public, I have a right to access these records to gain a better understanding of the professional conduct and performance of now Mayor Eric Adams during his time with the New York City Police Department.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold, redact, or destroy information related to this request will result in legal action and complaint. The failure to comply with FOIL is a serious matter and can result in both criminal and civil penalties. Therefore, I strongly urge you to comply with this request in a timely and complete manner.\r\n\r\nLast, I would like to bring to your attention the case law supporting my request:\r\n\r\nNew York City Administrative Code Section 14-151 (a) requires the New York Police Department to maintain records of all complaints and allegations of police misconduct, including records of investigations and findings.\r\n\r\nNew York State Committee on Open Government, Advisory Opinion #2016-4 (2016) states that police body-worn camera footage is presumptively available under FOIL.\r\n\r\nMatter of Fappiano v. New York City Police Department, 95 A.D.3d 981 (2d Dep't 2012) held that \"FOIL represents a strong policy in favor of open government, and its exemptions must be narrowly construed.\"\r\n\r\nNew York Times Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 756 F.3d 100, 117 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that \"the public has a vital interest in information regarding the operations of its government\" and that the FOIA \"embodies the basic principle that an informed citizenry is essential to democracy\").\r\n\r\nMatter of DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Spitzer, 7 N.Y.3d 653, 663 (2006) (stating that \"FOIL, like FOIA, reflects a strong policy in favor of open government, and its exemptions must be narrowly construed\").\r\n\r\nPlease note that any attempt to withhold, redact, or destroy information related to this request will result in legal action and complaint.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",
