        "communication": "Hi, Grey:\r\nThank you for your email.\r\n\r\nClarification is needed before we can begin searching for records. Indiana\u2019s public records law (APRA) requires a request for public records to be made with \u201creasonable particularity,\u201d which is necessary for an agency to locate and disclose records responsive to a request accurately and efficiently. See Ind. Code \u00a7 5-14-3-3(a). Indiana\u2019s Public Access Counselor has written many advisory opinions on what \u201creasonable particularity\u201d means; for example, the Public Access Counselor advises that requests for emails include a specifically named sender and recipient, a date range of less than six months, and search terms. See Advisory Opinion of the Public Access Counselor 16-FC-128.\r\n\r\nTo enable us to conduct a search, please narrow your request as outlined below.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health is not denying your request, but is instead asking that you amend your request to satisfy the legal requirements of APRA. After receipt of such an amended request, responsive records will be identified and gathered. It may be that some records will be produced subject to redaction and other documents may be withheld as permitted by applicable law. Pursuant to Indiana Code \u00a7 5-14-3-3, disclosable records will be provided in a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDenise Derrer Spears\r\nPublic Information Director\r\nIndiana State Board of Animal Health   www.in.gov/boah<http://www.in.gov/boah>\r\nIndiana Board of Veterinary Medicine   www.in.gov/VetBoard<http://www.in.gov/VetBoard>\r\nOffice:  317-544-2414\r\nMobile:  317-501-7583\r\n\r\n*We'd love your feedback.

The reports are required according to FDAAA Section 505(o)(3) and the first report would have been due in or around June 2023 and then annually in June 2024 and June 2025 (or thereabouts).  However, it appears the reports might not have been submitted to the FDA as the PMR site at FDA states its status is \"Delayed\" and that \"The final protocol submission was missed and the FDA issued a missed milestone letter on 04/21/2025, and a subsequent failure to respond letter on 06/17/2025.\"  \r\n\r\nSince the above-mentioned reports are required, they should be easy to  immediately identify electronically as PMR 4497-1 and to forward to us. If instead, the company has not submitted any reports, or omitted some reports, we request confirmation of that.  We first requested these reports in November 2024. We believe the mortality data is critical for the public health and safety and hope the FDA will assist with obtaining their immediate release.\r\n\r\nI am a professional journalist writing with my colleague, Shannon Brownlee, for The BMJ and The Lever.\r\n \r\nAs an investigative journalist, I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this FOIA request and duplicating responsive records.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJeanne Lenzer\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJeanne Lenzer",
