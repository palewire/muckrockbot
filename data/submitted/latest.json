These jurisdictions are: Richmond, Chesterfield , Prince William County, Fairfax County, Virginia Beach and Loudon County. We are requesting four data points for each case- the jurisdiction, the reimbursement amount, the associated case number, and the date of reimbursement. We are not requesting defendant name, attorney name, or any address information. If possible, we would request this data be stored in a spreadsheet if the applicable database is capable of exporting to a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite\r\nlocations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both\r\ninvestigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially\r\nresponsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I\r\nrequest copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other\r\ndocumentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or\r\ndestruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has\r\nno other copies of said records. If previously released records are available,\r\nthen I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional\r\nrecords are located and processed for release. The requested documents will be\r\nmade available to the general public, and this request is not being made for\r\ncommercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if\r\nyou would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if\r\navailable or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated\r\ncooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this\r\nrequest within 20 business days, as the statute requires.
