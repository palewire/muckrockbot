(RICO)\r\n-  Numerous other State and City codes.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to continue your current activities, I will not hesitate to file complaints and publicly expose your ongoing criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of my position, nor is it a waiver of any rights or remedies in this or any other related matter.  I insist on your immediate compliance, and expect a written response within two weeks.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\n \r\nTargeted Individual\r\nTargetedJustice.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID HT001122F0085, for a delivery order given to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC (UEI: C1HBCJ9RMBV3) in the research area of \"SERVICES FOR PHYSICS-BASED MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND TEST FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF UNCONVENTIONALLY ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY.\" This contract was awarded by the Department of Defense through the Defense Health Agency on behalf of the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command and has an action date of September 13, 2022 . This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC and/or its parent entity, The Johns Hopkins Univeristy (UEI: FTMTDMBR29C7)\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into the physical effects of directed energy attacks, as currently there is a concern among the members of the media and the public about so-called anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2016, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents under the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC has been awarded contracts or grants covering similar research areas by the Department of Defense; award IDs N0002420F8124 and N0002421F8162 are active with the Naval Sea Systems Command as of May 2023 for work on \"directed energy bio effects.\" This request would contribute to public understanding of how the government is handling research on anomalous health incidents and unconventionally acquired brain injuries.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
