All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",

        "communication": "Dear Lara Nochomovitz, \n\nThis response acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\u00a0 Your request has been assigned control number 2026-22480. \n\nPlease be advised that the status of requests submitted through the Public Access Link (PAL) may be tracked at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx, and you will receive an email response to your request upon completion of processing. The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \n\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \n\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \n\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \n\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \n \nSincerely, \n\nFOIA Intake\n",
