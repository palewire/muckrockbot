If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. Thank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This includes, but is not limited to, documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and so on. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency.\r\n\r\nSee complaint tracking numbers below -\r\n\r\n2016-0005-P\r\n2016-0095-P\r\n2016-0118-R\r\n2016-0250-P\r\n2016-0413-R\r\n2016-0455-R\r\n2016-0651-R\r\n2016-0709-R\r\n2017-0026-P\r\n2017-0427-R\r\n2017-0556-R\r\n2017-0642-R\r\n2018-0072-P\r\n2018-0334-R\r\n2018-0350-R\r\n2018-0570-R\r\n2019-0517-P\r\n2019-0555-R\r\n2019-0597-R\r\n2019-0617-R\r\n2020-0168-R\r\n2020-0324-R\r\n2020-0142-R\r\n2020-0121-R\r\n2020-0182-R\r\n2021-0323-R\r\n2021-0502-R\r\n\r\nWe were also told that each PIB report needs to be its own request. \r\nIt will be easier to manage all of the reports in a single request, therefore we are submitting this request as it was submitted originally.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
