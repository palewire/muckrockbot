Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Our main objective is to identify any records that align with your specific request. It's essential to understand that under the North Carolina Public Records Act, the university is not mandated to produce new records to satisfy a public records request.&nbsp;Because of the large volume of requests and a legal mandate to review every page to protect confidential information, it often takes time before we can start processing a new request.&nbsp;The broader and more vague the request the longer it takes to identify and collect potential records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease identify individual names, departments or vendors. The Public Records Office is unable to fulfill requests for \"all e-mails\", \"all documents\", \u201call [insert job title]\u201d across nearly 50,000 email addresses, as such a search would include accounts not subject to GS 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExclusions to Right of Access: There exist numerous statutes within the General Statutes that exempt certain records from public access. A brief overview of some of the most pertinent exceptions includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Personnel Records: While we protect most public employee details, some information such as name, age, salary, salary history, contract terms, original employment date, title, and hire date can be disclosed. All other details are deemed confidential.\r\n\r\n* Trial or Court Preparation Materials\r\n\r\n* Trade Secrets\r\n\r\n* Closed-Session Minutes Or Account of Closed-Session Minutes\r\n\r\n* Personal Identifying Information: Access is restricted to information that might lead to identity theft.\r\n\r\n* Records Involving Security\r\n\r\n* Contract Bid Documents &amp; Construction Diaries: Until a contract is awarded, details about informal construction or purchase bids remain undisclosed.\r\n\r\n* Telephone Numbers Held By 911 Systems\r\n\r\n* Emergency Response Plans\r\n\r\n* Detailed plans and Drawings of public buildings and Infrastructure\r\n\r\nFramework for Public Records Disclosure:\r\n\r\nOnly records that currently exist and pertain to public business will be disclosed. There is no obligation on our part to create or compile a non-existent record.&nbsp;While a majority of our records are related to business matters, there are significant exceptions to this rule. Any vague, overreaching, or burdensome request will not only be subjected to extended compliance times but may also be denied outright. The involvement of multiple parties or entities further complicates and elongates this process. For exhaustive demands, we reserve the right to levy fees to recuperate the considerable costs of record searching and duplication. Any reluctance or refusal to cover these charges can and will lead to delays or outright refusal in record delivery. Payments are required in advance of any release. Ensure you are specific and precise in your requests to avoid unnecessary expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor records relating to students, under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the university is obligated to ensure the privacy of student education records. Thus, student contact information and educational records remains undisclosed as per University Policy 105.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAthletic Contracts can be found here. https://appstatesports.com/sports/2018/2/21/athletics-head-coach-ad-contracts.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia representatives may contact the Office of University Communications with media inquiries here. https://uc.appstate.edu/media\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit https://appstate.nextrequest.com for information on fees that may be charged to cover the cost of producing public records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, upon reviewing these guidelines, you believe your request might not be in alignment, we kindly request that you consider withdrawing it. For a more in-depth understanding, you can review the Appalachian State University's Public Records policy here. http://policy.appstate.edu/Public_Records_Requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact us if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Public Records&nbsp;Team\r\n\r\nAppalachian State University\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact Appalachian State University.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://appstate.nextrequest.com/settings?id=2205336\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",
