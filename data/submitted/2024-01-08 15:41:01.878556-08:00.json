This includes but is not limited to: any electronic record of a key swipe, key fob use, code input, etc. indicating her entering the building or the parking lot. This includes but is not limited to the dates and times she has entered or exited the building or parking lot. \r\n\r\nIf any part of this request is not able to be fulfilled due to technological considerations, the lack or records, statutes prohibiting releasing, or the common law balancing test, the rest should be fulfilled according to law (and explanations for non-fulfillment should be given). \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted via Muckrock to maintain anonymity, which is allowed under the law. That said, all legal remedies will be pursued to obtain the records. Judge Berz is up for election and the public has an incredibly strong interest in knowing how often (or little) she is in the building.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Public",

        "communication": "ORS reference number 2400473:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public policy in this state is to give the public the greatest amount of access to public records as possible.  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.32.  The general presumption is that public records are open to the public unless there is a clear statutory or common law exception.  If there is no clear statutory or common law exception the custodian must \u201cdecide whether the strong presumption favoring access and disclosure is overcome by some even stronger public policy favoring limited access or nondisclosure.\u201d  Hempel v. City of Baraboo, 2005 WI 120, \u00b6 28 (citations omitted.)  Notwithstanding the presumption of openness, the public\u2019s right to access to public records is not absolute.  Journal/Sentinel v. Aagerup, 145 Wis. 2d 818, 822 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\nAt this time, the record that you have requested has been forwarded to the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office for investigation. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that documents relating to a pending investigation may be withheld from inspection.  Newspapers, Inc. v. Breier, 89 Wis. 2d 417, 438 (1979).  Relying upon Breier, the Wisconsin Attorney General has stated that such \u201cstatements by the court reveal sensitivity to the reputational interests of persons under investigation and indicate it may very well be proper to keep investigation files confidential until the investigation is substantially completed.\u201d  73 Wis. Op. Atty. Gen. 38, 43 (February 17, 1984).  Furthermore, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has also held that when \u201cthe release of a police record would interfere with an on-going prosecution or investigation, the general presumption of openness will likely be overcome.\u201d  Linzmeyer v. Forcey, 2002 WI 84, \u00b6 30, 254 Wis. 2d 306.\r\n\r\nIn, 2008 Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that record custodians, except for a prosecutor, may not rely on the common law exception for public access to prosecution files when denying a public records request.  Portgage Daily Register v. Columbia County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t. 2008 WI App. 30.  The court of appeals held that the records custodian must include policy reasons for nondisclosure of records pertaining to an ongoing criminal investigation. However, as the attorney general made clear in an informal opinion, the public\u2019s interest in not undermining a criminal prosecution is one of the public-policy interests that may outweigh the presumption of disclosure for police records that have been forwarded to the district attorney. Informal Correspondence from Wis. Att\u2019y. Gen. to Mr. Dean Collins, City of Brookfield Assistant Chief of Police (Nov. 13, 2007).\r\n\r\nRegarding your request, because of the serious public interest in ensuring a thorough, unimpeded, and unbiased criminal investigation of this matter, and after carefully conducting the required balancing test, it is the record custodian\u2019s determination that the balance tips in favor of nondisclosure.  MPD believes that the public interest in thoroughly investigating this matter outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the records at this time.\r\n\r\nTherefore your request is denied because it is the subject of a pending investigation or an ongoing prosecution, which would be hindered by the release of this police record. After the case is resolved, you may resubmit your request. If you do decide to resubmit your request, please reference CASE NUMBER 232980132.\r\n\r\nThis determination is subject to review by mandamus action under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1), or upon an application to the Wisconsin Attorney General or the Milwaukee County Corporation Counsel.\r\n\nSergeant Jason Kotarak\r\nOpen Records Section\r\nMilwaukee Police Department",

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), the Supreme Court\r\n    emphasized the importance of a broad interpretation of FOIA to ensure\r\n    disclosure of government information.\r\n    The D.C. Circuit in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34\r\n    F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998), held that non-commercial requesters should not\r\n    bear the full cost of FOIA processing, supporting my request for a fee\r\n    waiver.\r\n    In Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,\r\n    489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Court recognized the public interest in\r\n    understanding government activities, underscoring the importance of the\r\n    requested information.\r\n    Fee Waiver Justification:\r\n    \r\n    I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The Supreme\r\n    Court, in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the\r\n    Press, affirmed the public interest standard for fee waivers. The disclosure\r\n    of the requested information is in the public interest because it\r\n    contributes significantly to understanding the FBI's handling of FOIA\r\n    requests, particularly from prolific or high-profile requesters. This\r\n    request is not for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    Response Time and Appeal Process:\r\n    \r\n    In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A), I expect a response to this\r\n    request within 20 business days. In case of a denial or partial denial, I\r\n    request a detailed justification, citing specific exemptions as established\r\n    in Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n    \r\n    Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your\r\n    compliance within the stipulated timeframe, as mandated by FOIA.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Jordan Lassiter\r\n    \r\n    Enclosures:\r\n    Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n    Screenshot of the KTLA Article for Reference\r\n    \r\n    Please be aware: All communications related to this request, including\r\n    incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on\r\n    MuckRock.com.

If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific exemptions.\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the California Public Records Act and is subject to litigation.\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the California Public Records Act, I look forward to your response within ten business days.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\nFee Waiver Request Letter\r\nScreenshot of the KTLA Article for Reference\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

This request is aimed to acquire a thorough understanding of the FOIA process, decision-making criteria, and specific information about accounts receivable related to FOIA fees, in addition to information previously requested.\r\n\r\n    Detailed Update on Previous Requests:\r\n        Comprehensive status report, including any actions undertaken or pending, on my prior FOIA requests (reference numbers: Foil #259, MR 146407).\r\n        Detailed explanations for any delays, denials, or pending decisions related to these requests.\r\n\r\n    In-depth Inquiry into FOIA Process and Denied Requests:\r\n        All documents outlining the internal procedures for processing FOIA requests, with emphasis on any amendments or policy changes post my initial request on May 29, 2023.\r\n        Detailed records of the last 300 FOIA requests denied by your office since my original request, including justifications, corresponding communications, and exemption logs.\r\n\r\n    Records Concerning City Officials and Internal Communications:\r\n        Comprehensive records related to the oaths of office, employment records, and HR complaint records of currently appointed officials in the Peekskill City Clerk's Office, Police Department, and Corporation Council.\r\n        Full email correspondences and internal memos pertaining to the processing, denial, or appeal of my earlier FOIA requests #173 and #250.\r\n\r\n    Request for Accounts Receivable Information Related to FOIA Fees:\r\n        A detailed account of receivables connected to FOIA request processing fees over the past five years.\r\n        Information on the policies and procedures regarding the calculation, billing, and collection of FOIA fees, including any instances of waived or reduced fees.\r\n\r\nI emphasize the need for transparency and adherence to legal standards in processing these requests. In accordance with legal precedents (Konigsberg v. Coughlin, Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine), I assert that neither the size nor the perceived administrative burden should impede access to information.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of this request be denied, I request a detailed justification for each refusal, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and an exemption log as established by Vaughn v. Rosen and Fisher v. United States Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with legal obligations outlined in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Department of Defense, please ensure the preservation of records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the requested information electronically. If there are costs exceeding $200 for searching or copying these records, please inform me prior to fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nI await your response within the 20-business-day period as prescribed by the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this important matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter \r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n\r\n    Fee Waiver Request Letter)\r\n    Copies of previous FOIA request correspondences (for reference)",

Any and all drone footage captured during pro-Palestine protests in the specified timeframe.\r\n2. Correspondence, memos, or guidelines related to the use of drones for monitoring protests.\r\n3. Any reports or analyses generated from the collected drone footage.\r\n\r\n4. Communications between NYPD personnel discussing the deployment, use, and analysis of drone footage during pro-Palestine protests.\r\n\r\n5. Logs or records indicating the specific dates, times, and locations where drones were deployed to monitor pro-Palestine protests, with a particular focus on the key locations such as Times Square, Penn Station, and Rockefeller Center.\r\n\r\n6. Training materials or documentation provided to NYPD personnel regarding the use of drones for surveillance purposes in the context of public gatherings or protests.\r\n\r\n7. Any agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding between the NYPD and external entities, including federal agencies or private contractors, related to the use of drones during the specified pro-Palestine protests.\r\n\r\n8. Policies or procedures governing the retention and storage of drone footage, including any guidelines for the deletion or preservation of such records.\r\n\r\nIn order to narrow down the search, I request that a key string search be performed for terms such as \"protest,\" \"demonstration,\" \"Palestine,\" and any relevant keywords used during surveillance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to specify the following locations for the requested drone footage:\r\n\r\n- Times Square\r\n- Penn Station\r\n- Rockefeller Center\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\n1. **North Carolina Press Ass'n v. North Carolina Dep't of Crime Control & Public Safety,** 323 N.C. 373, 381 (1988): This case establishes the public's right to access government records, especially those related to surveillance and protests, and supports the principle that such records are subject to disclosure under FOIA.\r\n\r\n2. **Blackwell v. FBI,** 646 F.3d 37, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2011): This case reaffirms the public's right to access law enforcement records and emphasizes the importance of transparency in government activities.\r\n\r\n3. **ACLU v. FBI,** 2017 WL 4563355 (D.D.C. Oct. 12, 2017): This case underscores the public's right to access information related to government surveillance, especially in the context of protests and political activities. It establishes the principle that transparency in surveillance practices is essential for maintaining a free and open society.\r\n\r\n4. **Detroit Free Press, Inc. v. DOJ,** 73 F.3d 93 (6th Cir. 1996): This case reaffirms the importance of disclosing information related to law enforcement activities, highlighting the government's duty to provide the public with access to records that contribute to an understanding of government operations.\r\n\r\n5. **John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp.,** 493 U.S. 146 (1989): This Supreme Court decision emphasizes the presumption of openness in government activities, stating that agencies should be compelled to disclose records unless the information falls under a specific exemption. It supports the idea that transparency is vital for accountability and informed public discourse.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per **Vaughn v. Rosen,** 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in **Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,** 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",
