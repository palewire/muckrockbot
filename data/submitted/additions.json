Specifically, I am seeking a complete spreadsheet containing, for each such officer\u2019s certification record, the following fields:\r\n\r\nName\r\nAcademy ID number (as used in the ACADIS database)\r\nEmploying agency\r\nCertification issue date\r\nCertification status (active, inactive, revoked, etc.)\r\nSeparation date (if the certification status is now inactive)\r\nReason for separation (if the certification status is now inactive)\r\n\r\nThis request covers all time periods for which each active officer has been certified; no date range limitation is needed because I am interested in the full certification history of anyone who is currently active as a law enforcement officer. If any portion of these records is withheld as exempt, I request that you segregate any exempt material and release the rest. If possible, please provide the records in an electronic spreadsheet or database format (e.g. Excel or CSV).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLucas",
