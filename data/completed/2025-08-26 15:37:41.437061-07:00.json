Records of the most recent inventory of rifles possessed by the Sheriff's Office, as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code (assault rifles, patrol rifles, sniper rifles, .50 caliber rifles).\r\n2. Records indicating the number of rifles, as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code,  privately possessed by personnel of the Sheriff's Office with its authorization, OR the number of Sheriff's Office personnel with such authorization.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, I ask that you make records available to me as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n \r\nThe requested documents or information from them will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the American Friends Service Committee California Healing Justice Program at jlindsay-poland@afsc.org or by phone at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

I was quoted a rough estimate of $400 for the digital evidence on 6/25/2024, but at the time I declined to move forward with the digital evidence portion and the request was closed. I would now like to move forward with digital evidence and I'm writing to request an invoice. Also, would it be possible for me to get an index or list of contents for the digital evidence portion, so I would know in advance what it will contain? Is there any other material in this case? Would the State's Attorney's office be able to help me with further discovery documents?\r\nMany thanks for your help,\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMikita Brottman",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any letter sent by Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin containing the words \"I receive requests\". \r\n\r\n2. Any communications sent to or from United States Attorney Ed Martin which mention \"Wikimedia\", \"Wikipedia\", \"Wiki\", or *wiki* (i.e., using asterisks as wildcards such that a search would return, e.g., https://wikipedia.org/). \r\n\r\nThis request is limited to letters or communications sent to or received by Martin on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nThe Department has previously granted FIRE expedited processing in a related request. See Request No. EOUSA-2025-003687 (Apr. 24, 2025).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely an Interim United States Attorney's practice of sending letters seeking \"information\" for speech protected by the First Amendment. Specifically, Ed Martin has sent letters to (a) Georgetown University Law Center concerning its faculty members' classroom teaching (https://www.ncronline.org/files/2025-03/3.7.24%20Ed%20Martin%20letter%20%20to%20Georgetown%20law.pdf); (b) U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer concerning U.S. Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch (https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/); (c) U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia concerning comments made about Elon Musk (https://bsky.app/profile/robertgarcia.bsky.social/post/3lin33orhnk2r); and (d) a medical journal's editor (https://x.com/_Eric_Reinhart/status/1912958244768690407).  This request cocnerns an additional letter Martin sent to Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocNyx34Et19sKtlta0bTPPzSPcpi375T/view).\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-prosecutor-threatens-wikipedia\r\nb. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nc. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nd. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\ne. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\nf. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\ng. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\nh. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\ni. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\nj. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nk. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nl. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nm. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nn. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\no. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\np. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\nq. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/\r\nr. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-dept-schumer-inquiry.html\r\ns.  https://www.mediaite.com/politics/maga-u-s-attorney-sends-letter-to-house-democrat-over-criticism-of-elon-musk-who-you-call-a-dick/\r\nt. https://www.rawstory.com/trump-justice-department-2671190340/\r\nu. https://www.yahoo.com/news/acting-dc-us-attorney-ed-150929791.html\r\nv. https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/21/trumps-dc-us-attorney-launches-project-whirlwind-to-investigate-critics-for-their-speech/\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum, including the article published by The Free Press concerning Martin's letter to Wikimedia (https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-prosecutor-threatens-wikipedia). This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on educational institutions, academic publications, and elected officials to limit protected speech on matters on public concern. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry\" into Georgetown University Law Center due to its curriculum. Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter to Wikimedia was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin's letters are of particular interest because they are relevant to his nomination for the office of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. On April 2, 2025, ten members of the United States Senate sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, asking him to schedule a hearing to consider Martin\u2019s nomination. (Letter from Sen. Richard J. Durbin, et al., to Sen. Chuck Grassley, Apr. 2, 2025, available at https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25878847/ed-martin-hearing-letter-4225-final.pdf.)  At least one prominent commentator has cited Martin\u2019s efforts to chill curriculum at Georgetown (among other efforts to chill speech) as a reason for the Senate to refuse to confirm Martin. (Jack Goldsmith, The Senate and the Edward Martin Nomination, Executive Function (Apr. 3, 2025), https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/the-senate-and-the-edward-martin.) These concerns, raised by prominent intellectual and political leaders, indicate that Martin's letters raise possible questions about the government's integrity.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

I would like the link so I have everything discussed at that meeting. There was also a mention that the presentation was videotaped and posted somewhere?\r\n\r\nAlthough there are references to these in various areas, the VMI BOV Website now no longer provides the records from the 2022 BOV Meetings (on the Main site or dashboard), so I could not access them there.\r\n\r\nThese should all be readily available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If so, the cost is only $3.16 more. If the automatic waiver level is $50, then this is only $8.19 above that. If this is incorrect, please provide me with VMI's officially published fee waiver in these areas.\r\n\r\nVMI posts BOV Records to its website for free download.  The situation is just that it is not posting the year of this (and my other) request. While it is reasonable that some search would be required for older records before the BOV transitioned to electronic records, it is also reasonable that these should be readily available in electronic form and should be provided at no cost.\r\n\r\nBy \u00a7 2.2-3707. Meetings to be public; notice of meetings; recordings; minutes G.: \"At least one copy of the proposed agenda and all agenda packets and, unless exempt, all materials furnished to members of a public body for a meeting shall be made available for public inspection at the same time such documents are furnished to the members of the public body.\" While VMI appears to be complaint with this through its \"dashboard\" on the BOV website for recent meetings, this is not available for the 2021 and 2022 meeting . The statute does not contain any requirement that these materials must be requested at the time of the meeting, only that they should be available to the public as of \"at the same time such documents are furnished to members of the public body.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, if you decline my appeal of the fee charged, I kindly request that you complete the request form while I arrange payment. VMIU's published FOIA guidelines state: \"If we estimate that it will cost more than $200 to respond to your request, we may require a deposit, not to exceed the estimated amount, before proceeding with your request.  The five days we have to respond to your request do not include the time between when we request a deposit and when you respond.\" This is well below $200, and filling it should not be held waiting for payment.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time in reviewing this and I look forward to your response.",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",

For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is 1590533-000. \r\n\r\nWe reviewed the 3 pages that the FBI sent us.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \r\n\r\nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C).  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).\u00a0 Exemption 7(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0 The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.\u00a0 The public interest under Exemption 7(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party.\u00a0 In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA, but rather, would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.

Your    request was assigned ATF tracking number 269631.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \r\n\r\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 862 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \r\n\r\n(b)(6)/(b)(7)(C) \r\nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 29 pages in part: PII. \r\n\r\nWe are withholding information related to third parties, for whom you did not provide a waiver, under FOIA Exemption 6. To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the person whose information you requested. Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, w e are withholding information regarding third parties, for whom you did not provide a waiver, under Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA.  Exemption 7(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C).  The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.  The public interest under Exemption 7(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party.  In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA but would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of    the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a              standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for any further assistance and to discuss any  aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and        Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

We received these documents on April 2, 2024, and this referral was assigned file number PARDONFOIA 2024-308965. Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this Office. For your reference, the FBI\u2019s file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000.  Please be advised that we have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions.  After carefully reviewing the clemency-related records maintained in the FBI\u2019s files pertaining to Samuel Loring Morison, we have determined that 62 pages are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C) , which concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, as well as U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) , which also concerns material the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. However, we have determined that 1 page is appropriate for release with redactions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) and/or U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). In addition to the records referred by the FBI, we also searched our own files and located 1 page that is responsive to your request and which we have determined is appropriate for release in full.\u202fThe releasable record is a copy of the clemency warrant for Samuel Loring Morison.  Due to the age of the case, this disclosure includes all segregable, nonexempt records within our possession or control. All other records from PARDON\u2019s files have\u202fbeen transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA),\u202fand that agency is now the owner of the records (Records of the Office of the Pardon Attorney: https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/204.html ).\u202fIf you have not done so already, you may wish to submit a request directly to NARA for the records you seek at the following address by using the reference number provided above:   National Archives and Records Administration \r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Staff \r\nNWCTF-Room 6350 \r\n8601 Adelphi Road \r\nCollege Park, MD 20740 \r\n(866) 272-6272   For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.  You may email this office at PardonAttorneyFOIA@usdoj.gov for any further assistance with your FOIA request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

(\"CPRA\u201d), and all other applicable laws, please disclose the following records.\r\n\r\nAny and all autopsy, death investigation, and coroner\u2019s reports relating to the death of:\r\n\r\nName: Jose Soliz, Date of birth: 03-25-1993, Date of death: 11-26-2022\r\n\r\nIf records pursuant to this request are possessed in machine-readable format such as an .xls, .csv spreadsheet file, please provide the record in this format. Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much, \r\n\r\nSam Levin",

This information shall also be reported to the DOJ by January 15, 2019, and annually on this date thereafter. \r\n\r\nI understand Annual Reports are created, I am seeking the data used in the reports. \r\n\r\nInclude copies of submitted reports from each department, including each Form BCIIS-SB54-1, Form BCIIS-SB54-1A, and Form BCIIS-5854-2.

Beecher (May 27, 1933 \u2013 February 9, 2024). His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/business/media/william-beecher-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All e-mail messages from the email address \"Raphael.Sanchez@ice.dhs.gov\" to the following e-mail address: \"Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com.\" This includes e-mail messages with  Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com in the \"From,\" \"To,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" address lines. \r\n\r\n2. all e-mail messages from any other e-mail address currently or previously assigned to Raphael Sanchez  to the following e-mail address: \"Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com.\" This includes e-mail messages with Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com in the \"From,\" \"To,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" address lines. \r\n\r\n3. We are requesting the results of any investigation into Raphael Sanchez related to the dispensation or misuse of confidential information related to immigrants. \r\n\r\n4. In addition to the records requested above, I also request records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request. If you use FOIA questionnaires or certifications completed by individual custodians or components to determine whether they possess responsive materials or to describe how they conducted searches, I also request any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive media coverage of and public attention to the criminal scheme that led to the arrest and conviction of Raphael Sanchez. His sentencing was widely covered  in the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/06/28/former-ice-attorney-who-made-almost-200000-stealing-immigrants-identities-sentenced-to-4-years/?utm_term=.c3f2362ef3c1) the Seattle Times (https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/seattle-ice-lawyer-facing-prison-time-for-stealing-identities-of-would-be-immigrants/ and https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/ex-ice-attorney-sentenced-to-4-years-for-stealing-ids-of-would-be-immigrants/), the Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/28/ice-lawyer-raphael-sanchez-immigrant-identity-theft-sentence), and in local media (https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/seattle-ice-attorney-gets-prison-time-for-stealing-identities-of-aliens/281-568780668 and https://www.theindychannel.com/about/news-team/rafael-sanchez-1 and http://kuow.org/post/how-ice-attorney-stole-immigrant-ids-years). This request seeks to uncover additional information about his criminal scheme, the prosecution of which is now completed. \r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched denaturalization issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I have written and researched at length the treatment of immigrants by ICE and the process for deporting immigrants from the United States.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, the articles above and others indicate Raphael Sanchez was only charged with a single instance of identity theft but that there may have been many more. Immigrants who have been in removal proceedings before the Seattle Immigration Court deserve to know if their identities have been stolen. However, thus far ICE has shared no further information. For some, the need for this information will be extremely urgent, because identity theft by Mr. Sanchez or others may lead to a lifetime of irreversible consequences. \r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated where perhaps 700,000 US Citizens would be at risk of losing their citizenship. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the USCIS should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request and any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request. Thus, the agency has not conducted an adequate search or responded to the substance of the request. \r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the portion of the request that the agency does respond to, a GLOMAR response is inappropriate, as the investigation into Raphael Sanchez is already public record. Mr. Sanchez was criminally prosecuted, has been sentenced, and is in prison for stealing the identities of immigrants. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/06/28/former-ice-attorney-who-made-almost-200000-stealing-immigrants-identities-sentenced-to-4-years/?utm_term=.d823904ff7df. He lacks any privacy interest in his criminal actions, and the public nature of the prosecution makes any interest the agency has in maintaining privacy null and void. The agency should release the responsive records related to its investigations of Raphael Sanchez, even though Sanchez was already prosecuted and sentenced and his criminal case is completed.",

Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.\u00a0 Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.\u00a0 Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within\u00a030\u00a0days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.\u00a0 Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future.  Your request has been assigned reference number 2019-ICAP-00056. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. To check the status of an ICE FOIA/PA request, please visit . Please note that to check the status of a request, you must enter the 2019-ICAP-00056 (http://www.dhs.gov/foia-status) http://www.dhs.gov/foia-status tracking number.

I understand you need a search start/end date for the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from his ICE email address to his private Yahoo email address. According to the felony complaint against Mr. Sanchez filed in the Western District of Washington, Mr. Sanchez was using the private Yahoo email address to steal immigrants' identites from October 1, 2013 and October 25, 2017. Accordingly, I am requesting the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from the Yahoo email address during that period. Also, because it appears Mr. Sanchez only used the Yahoo address to steal immigrants' identities, all of the email messages he sent between the two accounts will be relevant to my request. I cannot limit the search to a particular set of keywords, but all email messages sent between the two accounts should be a small set of records and all of them are related to my research.   \r\n\r\nYou have no requested more information about Categories 3 and 4 of my request, so I will presume you do not need any further information about them. Should you need anything further, please let me know. Thank you. \r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock",

According to the felony complaint against Mr. Sanchez filed in the Western District of Washington, Mr. Sanchez was using the private Yahoo email address to steal immigrants' identites from October 1, 2013 and October 25, 2017. Accordingly, I am requesting the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from the Yahoo email address during that period. Also, because it appears Mr. Sanchez only used the Yahoo address to steal immigrants' identities, all of the email messages he sent between the two accounts will be relevant to my request. I cannot limit the search to a particular set of keywords, but all email messages sent between the two accounts should be a small set of records and all of them are related to my research.\r\n\r\nYou have not requested more information about Categories 3 and 4 of my request, so I will presume you do not need any further information about them. Should you need anything further, please let me know. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock\"",
