Also include any general policy changes in that time frame which may have applied to the National Cryptologic Museum.\r\n\r\nFor context, on our around February 1st, 2025, at least one exhibit in the National Cryptologic Museum's \"Hall of Honor\" depicting \"Women in American Cryptology\" was covered from public viewing with what appears to be brown paper [1]. An image of this censored display, which was shared by former NSA Director Michael Hayden, is attached to this request. As of February 2nd, 2024 the official Twitter account of the National Cryptologic Museum claimed to have \"corrected the mistake\" and uncovered the exhibit [2]. This request seeks documentation on why and how that mistake was made.\r\n\r\nIn response to this request, please provide any communications related to any decisions regarding exhibits in the National Cryptologic Museum within the given timeframe. Also include any communications regarding changes in policy related to the public presentation or sharing of NSA or intelligence community historical information.\r\n\r\n[1] General Michael Hayden, former NSA Director, displaying image of covered exhibit: https://bsky.app/profile/genmhayden.bsky.social/post/3lh6a65lgx226\r\n[2] National Cryptologic Museum Twitter Account (@NatCryptoMuseum): https://x.com/NatCryptoMuseum/status/1886135332787065343\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSteve Weis",
