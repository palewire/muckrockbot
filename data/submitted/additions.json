My watchlist identification number, as understood, is 9596690-00.\r\n\r\nI request a search of all relevant databases and systems maintained by your department, including any lists, indices, or databases related to national security, immigration, and customs enforcement watchlists.\r\n\r\nPlease include any guidance, policies, or procedures related to the nomination, maintenance, or removal of individuals from such lists, as well as any records regarding my specific inclusion or consideration for inclusion.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50. However, I would like to request a waiver of all fees for this request.
