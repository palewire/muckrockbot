The disclosure of this information is in the public interest as it provides transparency regarding the federal government's role in securing the internet's core architecture.\r\n\r\nIf certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the George W.

I look forward to working together in having his request resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

These contracts were signed on 12/7/2023 and 12/9/2024 by city employees. I have reason to believe these records should exist because according to Article VI of the Joplin Home Rule Charter, the City Attorney is required to approve of the form of all contracts. The charter indicates this approval should be marked on the contract, but since it is not I must assume the record exists elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn addition I am requesting the terms and conditions the City of Joplin agreed to in the contract dated 12/9/2024.  These terms are hosted online and are changed by Flock at will and without notice.  The current terms online are not the same terms agreed to by The City.  Archiving of the terms by archive.org is also not possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
