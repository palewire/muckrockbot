Our office has located the CAD and two citations. The records are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain information has been redacted from the attached record pursuant to KRS 61.878(1)(a). That statute exempts \u201cinformation of a personal nature where the public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]\u201d Id. This type of information includes social security numbers, date(s) of birth, operator license number(s), personal addresses, and telephone numbers, the disclosure of which may leave persons at risk for identity theft. See Zink v. Commonwealth, 902 S.W.2d 825 (Ky. App. 1994).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky State Police (\"KSP\") conducted a diligent search, but was unable to locate any other responsive records. KSP \u201ccannot afford a requester access to a record that it does not have or that does not exist, 99-ORD-98, and the agency discharges its duty under the Open Records Act by affirmatively so stating.\u201d 16-ORD-246 (citing 99-ORD-150). The right to inspect records, and the corollary right to receive copies, only attaches if the records requested are \u201cprepared, owned, used, in the possession of or retained by a public agency.\u201d&nbsp;KRS 61.870(2); 02-ORD-120, p. 10; 04-ORD-205. Further, a public agency is not statutorily required to \u201cprove a negative\u201d in order to refute an unsubstantiated claim that certain records exist.&nbsp;See Bowling v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov\u2019t, 172 S.W.3d 333, 341 (Ky. 2005) (\u201cbefore a complaining party is entitled to such a hearing [to refute the agency\u2019s claim that records do not exist], he or she must make a prima facie showing that such records do exist\u201d); 11-ORD-037.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKSP has confirmed that no other record exists because a search for numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 within your request produced no responsive records. Accordingly, KSP has discharged its duty regarding your request by notifying you in a timely response that a diligent search did not yield any results and explaining the reason for the nonexistence of such records in the possession of KSP. See Eplion v. Burchett, 354 S.W.3d 598, 604 (Ky. App. 2011) (declaring that \u201cwhen it is determined that an agency\u2019s records do not exist, the person requesting the records is entitled to a written explanation for their nonexistence\u201d).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal this decision, you may do so by filing a complaint with the Office of the Attorney General, Open Records/Open Meetings Division, The Capitol, 700 Capital Avenue, Suite 118, Frankfort, KY 40601, pursuant to KRS 61.880(2), or by filing an original action in Franklin Circuit Court under KRS 61.882.

Roberts. He was taken into custody by the Valdosta Police Department on January 23, 2023, after being found asleep behind the wheel at the intersection of West Magnolia Street and N St. Augustine Road around 2:20 AM. Upon waking him, officers observed signs of impairment and discovered Roberts had a handgun. After a brief conversation, Roberts fled the scene on foot and was apprehended shortly after. He was charged with DUI, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, obstruction of an officer, suspended license, and open container. I am requesting the available body-worn camera footage from the responding officers who made contact with Roberts, removed the weapon, and took him into custody following the foot pursuit.\r\n\r\nSuspect\u2019s Name:\r\nLakenry B.

Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although DHS\u2019 goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.

Your office\u2019s transparency and attention to detail \u2014 especially in providing internal memos, compliance statistics, and documents on the One-Bite and Confidential Monitoring Programs \u2014 stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by many other states. We\u2019re sincerely grateful for your willingness to engage so substantively.\r\n\r\nThe internal memos you provided reflect a thoughtful, evolving understanding of physician impairment \u2014 particularly your recognition that models like One-Bite may discourage physicians from seeking help. The move toward a Confidential Monitoring Program with expanded eligibility, nuanced relapse handling, and clinical discretion is a promising step that other jurisdictions would do well to study.\r\n\r\nAs part of our ongoing national research initiative on PHP structures and board oversight, I would like to respectfully submit a brief follow-up request for materials that speak directly to program effectiveness and accountability \u2014 a key area where many states (even those with strong intentions) still lack meaningful insight:\r\n\r\n1. Program Evaluations or Effectiveness Reviews\r\nWhile the provided statistics are invaluable, we did not locate any:\r\n\r\nFormal internal or external audits of OPHP program effectiveness.\r\n\r\nOutcome tracking data (e.g., long-term return to practice, relapse rates, recidivism).\r\n\r\nPhysician feedback or satisfaction surveys regarding the program.\r\n\r\nIf any summaries, reports, evaluations, or even raw de-identified data exist, we would be very grateful for the opportunity to review them.\r\n\r\n2. Appeal and Oversight Structures\r\nCould you clarify:\r\n\r\nWhether participants in the Confidential Monitoring Program have any avenues for appeal or recourse if they are found ineligible or removed from the program.\r\n\r\nHow OPHP determinations are reviewed, audited, or overseen, either by the Medical Board or a third-party body.\r\n\r\n3. Contracts and Meeting Minutes\r\nLastly, if available, we respectfully request:\r\n\r\nA copy of the contract, agreement, or MOU between OPHP and the State Medical Board of Ohio.\r\n\r\nAny meeting minutes or internal policy discussions (from 2019\u20132024) where OPHP program performance, reforms, or challenges were reviewed.\r\n\r\nWe are not requesting names or identifying details and welcome redacted versions as needed.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for the exemplary transparency already shown. We\u2019re grateful for your leadership and the Board\u2019s evolving approach to protecting public safety while supporting physician wellness. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if any portion of this follow-up needs clarification.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,",

This should include contracts for CCWIS or comparable systems that include predictive models as well as project descriptions for any models created in-house.\r\n\r\n2) Data dictionaries for all child welfare predictive models used by the department, including those provided by outside entities as well as in-house models. Data dictionaries are  documents commonly created for predictive models and databases. They describe the categories of data that are inputs (age, gender, etc.) and outputs (risk level, etc.) of predictive models. They are equivalent to headers on a spreadsheet, and do not include actual data.\r\n\r\n3) A list of all memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and/or data sharing agreements with state or local agencies for the provision of data that is incorporated into the department's child welfare predictive models. Should the department not maintain a list of these MOUs, I will accept copies of the MOUs themselves.\r\n\r\n4) Any differential impact assessments, validation studies, or comparable documents that describe the accuracy of child welfare predictive models used by the department. This should include any documents that describe common measures of predictive accuracy, such as area under the curve (AUC).\r\n\r\n5) All department policies, employee manuals, and guidelines describing how employees can and/or should use child welfare predictive models. \r\n\r\n6) All governance board, committee, or outside expert reviews assessing the efficacy of the department's proposed or current child welfare predictive models.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions regarding any aspect of this request, please don't hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employ involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help, and I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

This should include contracts for CCWIS or comparable systems that include predictive models as well as project descriptions for any models created in-house.\r\n\r\n2) Data dictionaries for all child welfare predictive models used by the department, including those provided by outside entities as well as in-house models. Data dictionaries are documents commonly created for predictive models and databases. They describe the categories of data that are inputs (age, gender, etc.) and outputs (risk level, etc.) of predictive models. They are equivalent to headers on a spreadsheet, and do not include actual data.\r\n\r\n3) A list of all memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and/or data sharing agreements with state or local agencies for the provision of data that is incorporated into the department's child welfare predictive models. Should the department not maintain a list of these MOUs, I will accept copies of the MOUs themselves.\r\n\r\n4) Any differential impact assessments, validation studies, or comparable documents that describe the accuracy of child welfare predictive models used by the department.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Anderson:\r\nThank you for your response dated March 4, 2025, to our Public Information Act request concerning physician disciplinary actions, health programs, and the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (MPRP).\r\nI am writing on behalf of a research organization, which is conducting nationwide research on physician health programs and rehabilitation systems. This research will culminate in a published book documenting how each state handles these critical matters of public health and professional oversight.\r\nWhile I appreciate your prompt response, I have significant concerns about the transparency limitations revealed in your letter:\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Action Data: Although you indicate the Board only tracks complaints by disciplinary grounds, this approach creates a concerning gap in understanding how mental health and substance abuse issues affect physician practice. Even if the data isn't categorized exactly as requested, would it be possible to provide the raw disciplinary data you do have? Our research team has expertise in analyzing such information to identify relevant patterns.\r\nAbsence of Information: It is surprising that the Board maintains \"no information responsive\" to four of our six requests, particularly regarding physician health programs. This suggests a potential gap in oversight that may be worth addressing at the policy level.\r\nMPRP Information: Rather than simply redirecting us to the Office of Contract Management and Procurement (OCMP), would your office be willing to facilitate this connection or provide a specific contact person? As a state-sponsored program affecting physician licensure, greater coordination between agencies would benefit the public interest.\r\n\r\nOur book will document how each state responds to these requests, highlighting both exemplary transparency practices and areas for improvement. \r\nWe would welcome the opportunity to revise our request in a way that might yield more substantive information, or to discuss alternative approaches to obtaining this important data. Public understanding of physician health programs serves both the medical community and patient safety.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me directly at [phone/email] if you would like to discuss how we might work together more productively on this matter.\r\nSincerely,",

In your\r\nfollow-up email, you ask if it's possible to receive our complaint data in\r\na \"raw\" format that your research team would then analyze to identify\r\nrelevant patterns.  Under Maryland PIA laws, the Board's investigative\r\nrecords, which include complaints, are confidential and prohibited from\r\npublic inspection.  Disclosure of these records is prohibited under GP \u00a7\r\n4-301(a)(2)(i).  This provision of the PIA prohibits disclosure of a record\r\nwhen disclosure is contrary to a state statute.  In this case, section\r\n\u00a714-411(b) of the Maryland Medical Practice Act expressly prohibits the\r\nBoard, a disciplinary panel, or any of its investigatory bodies from\r\ndisclosing any information contained in a record. Furthermore, all\r\ndisclosable, public information regarding disciplinary actions against\r\nlicensees is available for viewing on the Board's website\r\n<https://www.mbp.state.md.us/sanctions.aspx>.\r\n\r\nFor items two through six, you requested information on statistical data,\r\nstudies, policies, audits, reports on physician health programs, and\r\nspecifically the Maryland Physician Health Program (previously referred to\r\nas MPRP).  Again, the Board has no information responsive to your request.\r\nThe MPHP\r\n<https://www.mbp.state.md.us/resource_information/res_pro/resource_Practitioner_rehab_volunteer.aspx>\r\nis a voluntary, independent program not affiliated with the Board, as\r\nstated on our website. You were also directed to the resources to contact\r\nregarding your request for details on the relationship/agreement between\r\nMPHP and the Board.\r\n\r\n*Pursuant to GP \u00a74-362, you are entitled to seek judicial review of this\r\ndecision.  You may also refer any concerns about this decision to the\r\nPublic Access Ombudsman in accordance with GP \u00a7 4-1B-01 et seq.*\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRhonda Anderson\r\nMaryland Board of Physicians\r\nCHRC, License Renewal & Customer Service Unit\r\n410-764-4705\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Board is not authorized to nor does it give legal advice.

        "communication": "To Rhonda Anderson and the Maryland Board of Physicians:\r\nRe: Appeal of PIA Response dated May 7, 2025\r\nI am writing to challenge the Board's continued refusal to provide meaningful information in response to my Public Information Act request dated February 13, 2025.\r\nYour latest response mischaracterizes both my request and Maryland law in several critical ways:\r\n\r\nFalse Claim of Independence: You assert that the Maryland Physician Health Program (MPHP) is \"a voluntary, independent program not affiliated with the Board.\" This claim is demonstrably false. The MPHP is explicitly referenced in COMAR 10.32.22 as a \"rehabilitation program\" approved by the Board. By law, the Board must maintain documentation of this approval relationship. Your denial of any responsive records suggests either regulatory negligence or deliberate concealment.\r\nMisapplication of Confidentiality Provisions: While MD Code, Gen. Prov. \u00a7 4-301(a)(2)(i) and Medical Practice Act \u00a7 14-411(b) protect individual case information, they do NOT exempt aggregate statistical data, policies, or contractual agreements from disclosure. Your blanket citation of these provisions without distinguishing between protected individual records and disclosable administrative documents reflects a concerning overreach of confidentiality provisions.\r\nFailure to Segregate Disclosable Information: Maryland PIA requires agencies to separate exempt from non-exempt material rather than withholding entire categories of documents. Your failure to identify which specific records exist but are being withheld, versus which genuinely don't exist, violates both the letter and spirit of the PIA.\r\nPublic Interest Considerations: The Maryland Court of Appeals has consistently held that PIA exemptions must be \"narrowly construed\" in favor of disclosure, particularly when matters of public health and governance are concerned. The Board's relationship with MPHP directly impacts both physician welfare and patient safety - core public interests that outweigh generalized confidentiality claims.\r\nComparison to Other State Practices: The North Carolina Medical Board, responding to an identical request, provided comprehensive documentation of its relationship with its physician health program, statistical reports, and procedural documents - all without compromising individual confidentiality. Maryland's refusal to provide even basic policy documentation stands in stark contrast to this model of transparency.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion that my only recourse is judicial review or an Ombudsman complaint reflects an unfortunate unwillingness to engage substantively with legitimate public interest concerns.\r\nI respectfully request that the Board:\r\n\r\nImmediately provide all contracts, MOUs, or agreements between the Board and MPHP\r\nRelease redacted versions of policies or procedural documents governing referrals to MPHP\r\nProduce aggregate statistical information that does not identify individual physicians\r\nProvide any audits or evaluations of the MPHP program's effectiveness\r\n\r\nIf the Board maintains its refusal to provide any responsive documents whatsoever, I request written certification from the Executive Director personally attesting that the Board maintains absolutely no documentation of its relationship with a program explicitly referenced in its own regulations.\r\nI look forward to your response within 10 business days. Please be advised that I am simultaneously filing a complaint with the Public Access Ombudsman and exploring options for judicial review as suggested in your communication.\r\nSincerely,\r\nVig Sinclair\r\ncc: Maryland Public Access Ombudsman\r\nMaryland Attorney General's Office, Open Government Division",

Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records revealing the deliberations of agency officials used to reach a decision. \r\n\u2022 Preliminary Drafts and Similar Materials \u2013 Government Code section 7927.500 \u2013 Any preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business are exempt from disclosure. \r\n\u2022 Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Official Information Privilege \u2013 Government Code section 7927.705, Evidence Code sections 1040 \u2013 Information acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his or her duty and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public prior to the time the claim of privilege is made. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Records Related to Law Enforcement or Security \u2013 Government Code section 7923.600 \u2013 Records of complaints to, or investigations conducted by, or records of intelligence information or security procedures of \u2026 any state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Public interest balancing test - Government Code section 7922.000 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. \r\nPlease log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records: City Records Request - N000380-042225  Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\nKindest regards, Laura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk",

Unfortunately, we do not currently have funding to cover the cost of the full record request.\r\n\r\nInstead, I\u2019d be very grateful if you could provide the name, title, work email, and phone number of  supervisory-level staff at the Iowa Department of Corrections who are responsible for overseeing or coordinating mental health services or programming within state correctional facilities.\r\n\r\nI understand this may fall outside of a formal records search and hope this more limited request is feasible without significant cost. Any partial guidance or contact information you\u2019re able to share would be sincerely appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",
