As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39. If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests. The Simple track is for requests that can be processed in one to five workdays. The Normal track is for requests that can be processed in six to twenty workdays. The Complex track is for requests that can be processed in twenty-one to sixty workdays. The Exceptional/Voluminous track is for requests requiring more than sixty workdays for processing. The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing. Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nThis request falls into the Complex track.\r\n\r\nWe normally process requests on a first-in, first-out basis, however, due to the nature of your request and the circumstances surrounding this request, we will prioritize and process your request as the records become available. Please know that the Bureau\u2019s Management is very committed to providing responses to FOIA requests and remedying the FOIA backlog.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at BLM_WO_FOIA@blm.gov. Thank you for your interest in public lands and in programs and activities of the BLM.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:30a47f1d-a3b3-47fc-bb83-7b41916a62fa]",

        "communication": "Greetings,\r\n\r\nThis message is in regards to request  2024-FPRO-01665.\r\n\r\nMy request, filed April 29, 2024, was for \u201cAll feedback on the USPS plan to move processing operations from Reno, NV to Sacramento , CA that was collected in February 2024 via \u201cSurvey Monkey\u201d survey with the URL \u201chttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/mpfr-reno-nv\u201c\r\n\r\nYour amended fee estimate of May 23, 2024 categorized my request as from an \"other requester\" as justification for a fee assessment of  a minimum $140.70. I am appealing that  amended fee estimate. \r\n\r\nI believe I qualify as an educational and/or media requester, and for that reason the fees should be waived. My initial request did not specify my status. I am a journalism professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and this request was part of a public records class I teach. I will use this request, the appeal and communications related to it, and any documents obtained, in teaching that class. The records obtained will likely be used as part of public interest news media reporting--by students or other professional news media--on the USPS decision to move mail processing from Reno, NV to Sacramento, CA. I may also use this request and communications related to it in my academic research on public records. \r\n\r\nAs evidence of my status as an educational and/or media requester, you can view my professional bio and profile here: https://www.unr.edu/journalism/faculty-and-staff/directory/file-patrick. A description of the course I teach is here: https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2019/rsj-public-records-course. Some of my academic research on public records requests is here: https://journals.flvc.org/civic/article/view/119008\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this appeal.\r\n\r\nPatrick File\r\n",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to \"Filegate\", which arose in June 1996 around improper White House access in 1993 and 1994 to Federal Bureau of Investigation security-clearance documents. Access to the files, allegedly without permission, was given to Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, with estimates ranging from 400 to 900 unauthorized file disclosures.\r\n\r\nI request that processing be expedited, as there is widespread interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence. This is especially relevant given the upcoming election, in which Hillary Clinton (suspected by some of wrongdoing in 'Filegate') is a candidate. I certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I request that fees be waived, as the documents will be used to facilitate news stories which enhance the public's understanding of the government's handling of alleged wrongdoing. The documents will also be made available through the nonprofit Internet Archive's national security collection. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nI'm contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Filegate. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 2893 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  I can be reached via email at rbronson@fbi.gov, or you may call me at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRebecca Bronson\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\n540-868-1695",

I am writing to follow up on my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted to your office on March 17, 2024. The request pertains to: digital communications about a meeting with Aguada residents that took place on May 11, 2024 about their concerns over levee placements along the Madre Vieja channel.\r\n\r\nThe request also pertained to instructional materials, presentations, and presentation materials used to prepare for or used during the May 11 meeting with Aguada residents.\r\n\r\nAs of today, July 12, 2024, I have not received any response or communication regarding the status of my request. According to the FOIA regulations (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)), agencies are generally required to respond to FOIA requests within 20 business days from the date of receipt. It has now been well beyond that timeframe without any communication or indication of the status of my request.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the FOIA provides for legal remedies in cases of agency non-compliance, including the right to seek judicial review if an agency fails to respond to a FOIA request within the statutory time frame. While I hope to resolve this matter amicably and swiftly, I must insist on prompt action to fulfill my request or provide a specific explanation for any delay.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate update on the status of my request and an estimated timeline for when I can expect to receive the responsive records. If there are any issues or additional information needed to process my request, please do not hesitate to contact me at 787-449-4731 or carlosBP@protonmail.com.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",

In\r\nshort, though: your request, as is, may qualify for a 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut it does not qualify for a fee waiver. To qualify for a fee waiver, the\r\nrequest, among other things, must be narrowly tailored to preserve public\r\nresources, which it is not as it seeks records from a two year period from\r\nroughly 90 offices. Speaking more frankly, I can also tell you that a\r\nsearch in our e-mail records collection tool of \u201cfair work week\u201d\r\nunfortunately won\u2019t only return hits with \u201cfair work week\u201d -- it will\r\nreturn anything with \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d or \u201cweek\u201d in it, which I\u2019m sure you\r\ncan imagine will create countless (likely many thousands of) records that\r\nare not responsive to your request and that will need to be sorted through\r\nbefore we can provide you with the records that are responsive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to read through the attached policy and can confirm that\r\nyour request meets all of the qualifications for a fee reduction, I can\r\nproceed with the request as is and will grant you the 40% fee reduction,\r\nbut would ask for your patience as this request will take months of work to\r\ncomplete. I am also happy to work with you to help you reconfigure your\r\nrequest to be more specific (for example, by narrowing the search window,\r\nor seeking records from fewer offices) so that we can grant that full fee\r\nwaiver. If we do proceed with a fee reduction only, I will make sure to\r\ncommunicate a fee estimate before we actually begin processing your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed once you\u2019ve had a chance\r\nto read through the attached policy document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Michael Burns *|* Legal and Public Records Assistant*\r\n\r\nOffice of the Legislative Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice: 503.986.1243\r\n\r\n[image: http://intranet/CapitolImages/Oregon%20State%20Seal%20-%20Color.jpg]",

I am surprised to learn that your\r\ncollection tool does not allow for compound search terms or operators (e.g.\r\nfair AND work AND week). One way of working around this limitation might be\r\nto narrow the keyword search to certain fields, e.g. the email subject or\r\nattachment file name. Another possibility would be to search for records\r\ncontaining relevant bill numbers (SB878, SB888) instead of common words.\r\nBut I'm not sure if you can search specific fields or metadata of these\r\nemails. I would appreciate any further information or assistance you could\r\nprovide in tailoring my request.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nPeter",

        "communication": "Hi Peter,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m glad you asked, because it gave me an opportunity to check in with the team that pulls e-mails for us (our IT folks are the ones who pull the records, while we review, redact, and discuss/disseminate them with/to the various concerned parties.) What they told me is that compound search terms with operators do (read: should) work, and that if I am seeing results that contradict that we can investigate why. Since I frequently see evidence to the contrary, I\u2019ll have an opportunity to review with them the next time the issue comes up. It\u2019s quite possible that user error (i.e. using operators in lower case instead of all caps) yielded nonresponsive records in the past. Thankfully we do always find the correct records (assuming they exist)... we just tend to end up with a lot of separating the wheat from the chaff, which isn\u2019t practical for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe tool they use, by the way, is Office 365 eDiscovery. It doesn\u2019t allow you to limit what fields you\u2019re searching in, but if you\u2019re curious, this<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-keyword-queries-and-search-conditions?view=o365-worldwide> article discusses the ins-and-outs of how to use it.\r\n\r\nAs for your current request: really, I can limit it however you\u2019d like. The goal here is to make sure you are getting the records you want and are entitled to, so I\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re doing it right. I\u2019ll just need you to specify the conditions so I\u2019m not misinterpreting anything. We can use your original search terms, and can also add SB###, SB ###, Senate Bill ###, etc. to the list of terms. The search will find hits in both e-mails and attachments. The biggest issue remains the number of accounts you\u2019re asking us to pull records from, and the best advice I can offer is to limit your search to members of the Legislative Assembly and committees that actually worked on whichever bills you\u2019re interested in. You\u2019ll need to do the research on that if that\u2019s a route you\u2019d like to take, but OLIS<https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/previous-session-bills.aspx> is a great place to start.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll await further correspondence. Have a great day in the meantime.\r\n\r\nMichael",

I would like to add the bill number (828) as an alternate search term.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "08/12/2024 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuckRock News, DEPT MR136588 \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2024-ICAP-00127 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Appeal on remand. You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \n\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \n\nSincerely, \n\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist\n",

Get real.\r\nThat Josh Tetens was told by me in front of witnesses who heard me, and him at the Republican Club WITH Brittany Lannen, at that time she was waiting to sign a contract to represent the Crawleys and was AT the Republican Club with me and others rather upset at the entire situation. Tetens was given the opportunity to talk to her and he said he didn't need to because he believed her. \r\n\r\nThat I want and am forced to go to the Grand Jury Foreperson myself is a travesty in itself and you know it. \r\n\r\nTetens has had phone calls from other people who wanted to tell him what happened and he does not even call them back.\r\n\r\nI have emails and texts between myself and this DA and now I am satisfied that THIS is a travesty. I along with many, many others have been to the Federal authorities about this because YOU people simply don't care. However, you have law licenses and I have proof.\r\n\r\nI feel quite sure that you, Mr. Chapman would indeed rather have your head in the sand, it's oh, so much nicer, however, there is proof, witnesses and people who will not lie.\r\n\r\nThis has been going on since February the sixth and I, am quite tired of playing little games with you \"boys\" I have statements, texts, and on the other hand, your incompetence and total lack of \"curiosity\" about the matter. i suspect you talked to ole Par and he assured you I was crazy, well, let's see how this plays out. Remember you all KNOW about this so you're all culpable because of your knowledge and failure as officers of the court to do anything.\r\n\r\nLet's stop and think how my Complaint against not getting the name of the Grand Jury Foreperson along with this story plus evidence is going to play at the AG's office, then they too will  have the knowledge of a crime .....\r\n\r\nYour DA won't take this to the Grand Jury or even return calls from people who were there. The taxpayers paid 150K for this, Crawley himself is willing to tell any of you that call him and yet you don't. He told ME. \r\n\r\nSo you non curious good old boys just transfer what needs to go to what department and play your game. \r\nI have evidence and truth on my side.\r\nLet's play.\r\nI have 60K read me every day which equates to 47% of the voting public and that was BEFORE Parnell and Charlotte and the County yellow tape at the old mansion debaucle.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with you?\r\nTruly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Hope buying yourself three weeks was worth it. Also, you know I don't drive so it would be nice if you'd do the answers in the NORMAL WAY and not put them on a thumb drive so you can have me trot on down there and you can see who brought me. That's what this is, isn't it? Inconvenience and a few giggles, well, send me the answers to the questionnaires, and the other stuff you neglected to ad. Keep thinking everyone is stupid. Go ahead it's served you well so far, right?\r\nDustin, dear, you can go ahead and write me another little bitch out note about how this has nothing to do with Felton but we both know that at this point, it does. Plus, YOU are still an officer of the court. Tick tock.\r\nWe request all responsive ANSWERS from the employees and any further correspondence from any supervisor to any employee or from supervisor to supervisor to the questionnaire's that we received in open records. We request all documentation that accompanied these questions and their answers and further request and disciplinary measures that generated from any questionnaires that have been handed out by ANY supervisor in the past 13 months.\r\nAll letters of explanation from Aaron Burns, James Wolfe, Brad Stovall, Tim Davenport, Martin Arellano, Rose Peterson, Dustin Losak, Pete Peterson, Hunter Herring, Parnell McNamara, Jeremy Bost, Cody Blossman, Mike Gates, Colt Braziel, All Jail Sgt's. Any questionnaires that any of the employees have answered in the past 13 months, any letters\r\nWe also request any and all disciplinary actions that have been issued since Cody Blossman has been Chief Deputy or in the past 13 months. We would like to include all disciplinary records that are being kept in supervisors desk and not placed in the personnel files as these are government documents and we are requesting them. The fact that these disciplinary records may be being kept in a desk or file does not exempt them from being subject to open records as all disciplinary measures are open to the public to view.\r\nWe request the names of all employees who have resigned or been terminated from the McLennan County Sheriffs Office since Cody Blossman has been chief deputy or in the past 13 months.\r\nWe further request any and all emails and correspondence between Cody Blossman and Anna Picasso for the past 13 months.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\nSincerely,\r\nBernadette Feazell\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the U.S. Coast Guard personnel records (OMPF) for a former servicemember named TRACY LAUREN MARROW (DATE OF BIRTH: 03/16/1958). Mr. Marrow was born in Newark, New Jersey. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1977 to 1979 and achieved the rank of petty officer, second class. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Marrow, known popularly as the rapper Ice-T, should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Marrow\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

After his comment, the Village of Niles Board President George Alpogianis responded:\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I know I don't respond to things, but I will respond to this. When we start taking care of our veterans first and getting them out of their tents. All the homeless veterans that we have damn right we'll help anybody. We've got to help our own people first \u2026 our veterans. Thank you. \u201c[3]\r\n\r\nThe board went on to approve this ordinance with no discussion or further comment.[4]\r\n\r\nTo that effect we are seeking emails from village of Niles email addresses between November 1, 2023 and the date this request is processed (inclusive of those dates) that include any of the following keywords in the subject line and/or body:\r\n\r\n\u2013 \"migrant\"\r\n\u2013 \"asylum\"\r\n\u2013 \"immigrant\"\r\n\u2013 \"refugee\"\r\n\u2013 \"unscheduled bus stop\"\r\n\r\nPlease include any email attachments.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.

        "communication": "08/08/2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREFER TO:  279279 \n\nMs. Rebecca Renner \n\nEmail: 94187-19210523@requests.muckrock.com \n\nDear Ms. Renner: \n\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act request dated 6/3/2020, and received by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on the same date, in which you requested records concerning Black Lives Matter Protests in the US May and June 2020. Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 279279.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 13 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\n(b)(6)/(b)(7)(C) \nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), 13 pages have been released with 12 pages in part. Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld \n\nWe are withholding third party information, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6). To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). \nWe are withholding specific law enforcement codes, techniques, and procedures used in our investigation pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(E) exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records or information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). The information withheld reveals various law enforcement file numbers and codes which are primarily used to store and retrieve law enforcement information. The information withheld also reveals specific law enforcement procedures and techniques used in this investigation. Disclosure of this information could enable individuals outside of the agency to circumvent agency functions and gain access to sensitive investigative information. Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d \n\nSincerely, \n\nHirsh D. Kravitz \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division",

The number of search terms used and general nature of the search terms used (e.g., Heritage Foundation, EIN) is pulling in a lot of general and non-responsive information (examples attached).  For example, the term \u201cEIN\u201d which is presumably being used as an acronym for \u201cElection Integrity Network\u201d is hitting on the false positive \u201cEIN#\u201d or employee identification number (see page 4 of the attachment).  Additionally, the searches are producing several general newsletters and mass mailers which may delay the processing of your request.

Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Section 7(1)(f) exempts from release \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)]. Materials subject to attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m) which exempts communications between a public body and an attorney representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body. Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Section 7(d)(iv) of the FOIA exempts confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the U.S. Coast Guard personnel records (OMPF) for a former servicemember named JEFFREY LEON BRIDGES (DATE OF BIRTH: 12/04/1949). Mr. Bridges was born in Los Angeles, California. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1967 to 1975 and achieved the rank of petty officer second class. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Bridges, an Academy Award-winning film actor , should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Bridges Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
