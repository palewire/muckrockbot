Code directly involved in any anti-fraud measures is also not requested. However, if sensitive, non-responsive code/documents is intermixed with responsive code/documents (e.g., in the same file), I am requesting the non-responsive code/documents be redacted. If redaction will delay response, I am requesting non-redacted responsive code/documents (e.g., files or documents which do not contain any sensitive information) to be disclosed as soon as possible.  \r\n\r\nThis request is directed to the Internal Revenue Service directly as well as the US Office of Management and Budget, which, according to published IRS documents (e.g., https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf), worked with IRS through its USDS division to develop the system. To ease the burden of this request, I encourage IRS and USDS/OMB to work together to de-duplicate responsive records, to the extent that any coordination would not delay substantially delay the disclosure of responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of news that the IRS Direct File program may be discontinued, I am requesting these records to release to public such that a competitive, free, and open-source alternative may be provided. Accordingly, I am requesting a fee waiver, as the IRS's own report (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf) supports a free, non-commercial way to prepare tax returns, and is in the public interest. Any disclosed records will not be used for commercial advantage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKarl Koscher",
