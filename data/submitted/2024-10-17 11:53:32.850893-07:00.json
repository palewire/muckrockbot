This information is critical to my participation in the oversight and administration of this program.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I am requesting accommodations due to my condition. I respectfully request that all records be provided electronically via email, as opposed to portals or complex delivery methods, to ensure full and equal access to the information.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\nLegislative Records:\r\n\r\nAll bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative proposals, and legislative history related to the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nVoting records of all state and federal legislators on any legislation affecting the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nMinutes, transcripts, and audio/video recordings of meetings, hearings, or discussions where the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program was a topic.\r\nPublic Records:\r\n\r\nComprehensive reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations on the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nBudget allocations, financial statements, expenditure reports, and audit results related to the program, pursuant to Connecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66 and related sections).\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and intergovernmental agreements involving the administration or management of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCorrespondence:\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, and other forms of communication, including internal and external, regarding the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nInternal memoranda, briefing documents, policy directives, and decision-making correspondence related to the oversight and implementation of the program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\n\r\nNon-confidential employment records, including job descriptions, resumes, and performance evaluations, of individuals involved in the administration and oversight of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This request is consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a), which protects confidential personal data.\r\nOrganizational charts detailing the structure and personnel responsible for managing the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program within relevant state and federal agencies.\r\nProgram Information:\r\n\r\nAll guidelines, protocols, procedural documents, and compliance reviews governing the operation of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, as mandated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180) for home and community-based services waiver programs.\r\nImplementation plans, performance metrics, outcome reports, and evaluation summaries regarding the effectiveness of the program.\r\nComprehensive data sets related to enrollment, utilization, demographic information, and outcomes of beneficiaries participating in the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nSpecial Requests:\r\nExpedited Processing: Pursuant to Executive Order 13392, which mandates the improvement of agency disclosure processes, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to the public interest and personal impact of the information.\r\n\r\nElectronic Records: In compliance with my rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, I request that all records be provided in electronic format and sent directly to my email address. This will ensure that I can access the information without unnecessary barriers or delays.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).

This information is critical to my participation in the oversight and administration of this program.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I am requesting accommodations due to my condition. I respectfully request that all records be provided electronically via email, as opposed to portals or complex delivery methods, to ensure full and equal access to the information.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\nLegislative Records:\r\n\r\nAll bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative proposals, and legislative history related to the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nVoting records of all state and federal legislators on any legislation affecting the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nMinutes, transcripts, and audio/video recordings of meetings, hearings, or discussions where the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program was a topic.\r\nPublic Records:\r\n\r\nComprehensive reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations on the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nBudget allocations, financial statements, expenditure reports, and audit results related to the program, pursuant to Connecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66 and related sections).\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and intergovernmental agreements involving the administration or management of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCorrespondence:\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, and other forms of communication, including internal and external, regarding the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nInternal memoranda, briefing documents, policy directives, and decision-making correspondence related to the oversight and implementation of the program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\n\r\nNon-confidential employment records, including job descriptions, resumes, and performance evaluations, of individuals involved in the administration and oversight of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This request is consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a), which protects confidential personal data.\r\nOrganizational charts detailing the structure and personnel responsible for managing the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program within relevant state and federal agencies.\r\nProgram Information:\r\n\r\nAll guidelines, protocols, procedural documents, and compliance reviews governing the operation of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, as mandated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180) for home and community-based services waiver programs.\r\nImplementation plans, performance metrics, outcome reports, and evaluation summaries regarding the effectiveness of the program.\r\nComprehensive data sets related to enrollment, utilization, demographic information, and outcomes of beneficiaries participating in the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nSpecial Requests:\r\nExpedited Processing: Pursuant to Executive Order 13392, which mandates the improvement of agency disclosure processes, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to the public interest and personal impact of the information.\r\n\r\nElectronic Records: In compliance with my rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, I request that all records be provided in electronic format and sent directly to my email address. This will ensure that I can access the information without unnecessary barriers or delays.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).

As such, I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your request for records made pursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (the Act).\r\n\r\nAs I am sure you are aware, the Act requires \u201creasonable specificity,\u201d which is outlined in \u00a7 2.2-3704 (B) of the Code of Virginia<https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3704/>. With regard to your request for \u201cany and all communication\u201d, we ask that you please specify what type of \u201ccommunication\u201d you are requesting, such as emails.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please further narrow your request, such as providing specific individuals or groups of individuals and providing a date range, so we can better assess and respond to your records request.\r\n\r\nProviding greater specificity will help us better assess and respond to your records request and most likely help to reduce the number of records and the amount of time that our staff will need to search for, review, and possibly redact portions of these records. This will likely provide you with a cost savings, if applicable.\r\n\r\nUpon your further clarification regarding the additional requested information above, we will work to determine what records exist and are responsive to your request, as well as an estimate of any costs that may be associated with your request.\nRegards,\r\nRebecca Holbrook\r\nCommunications Specialist- FOIA Compliance\r\nHanover County Public Schools\r\nrholbrook@hcps.us",

Additional categorizations or details are acceptable to include.\r\n\r\n    Phone Call:\r\n        (2a) Answered by a live person.\r\n        (2b) Directed to voicemail with a message successfully recorded.\r\n        (2c) Directed to voicemail with no message recorded due to a full voice mailbox.\r\n        (2d) Directed to voicemail, but caller hung up or opted not to record a message.\r\n        (2e) Directed to an extension and answered by a live person.\r\n        (2f) Directed to an extension and answered by voicemail with a message successfully recorded. \r\n        (2g) Directed to an extension, answered by voicemail, but no message recorded due to a full voicemail box.\r\n        (2h) Directed to an extension, answered by voicemail, but caller hung up or opted not to record a message.\r\n        (2i) Directed to and answered by a live operator.\r\n        (2j) Directed to an operator, but not answered.\r\n        (2k) Call not answered by live person nor voicemail.\r\n        (2l) Other: Please specify\r\n        \r\n    Fax:\r\n        (2m) Received and job printed successfully at the time of reception.\r\n        (2n) Received but job not printed due to empty paper source.\r\n        (2o) Received but job not printed due to other reason - please specify.\r\n        (2p) Call not answered.\r\n        (2q) Other: Please specify\r\n        \r\n(3) A privacy-preserving, unique identifier derived from the caller's telephone number. \r\n\r\n    This identifier shall establish a 1:1 mapping to the source phone number and remain the same for all instances of the source phone number appearing in the inbound call log. \r\n    \r\n    A clarification: the requester is specifically NOT requesting a new record to be created, but rather, to merely provide the existing information in a different representation. The suggested way to achieve this is to use an HMAC cryptographic operation. The Python (https://www.python.org) script provided below demonstrates how to represent phone numbers as privacy-preserving unique identifiers via HMAC-SHA256.\r\n    \r\n    To preserve the privacy of callers, the requester specifically requests that if HMAC or a similar cryptographic scheme is used to satisfy this request, that the secret key is NOT disclosed in any response or public records, to the extent permitted by law.\r\n    \r\n\r\nExample Python Script:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n#\r\n# An example showing how to represent a log of phone numbers as\r\n# privacy-preserving unique identifiers using HMAC-SHA256.\r\n#\r\n# Below is the expected example output:\r\n# \r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-07 11:07:55, Status: 2b, Source: 37946e67b0fb1a193350c3f6f228f08df6e1078606a9617578d05868d9c203cc\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-10 23:59:12, Status: 2c, Source: 4f6dde6cf83ca4311ad66c8f97616682bd08848a383e7b23b032d602e3d7105d\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-15 13:00:35, Status: 2a, Source: ea558425ccced1be9f084efd9df45ae39343e138494a611a0c28877a9bb86f43\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-15 20:32:07, Status: 2g, Source: 37946e67b0fb1a193350c3f6f228f08df6e1078606a9617578d05868d9c203cc\r\n#\r\n################################################################################\r\nimport hashlib\r\nimport hmac\r\n\r\n# An example list containing the raw requested information\r\ndata = [\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-07 11:07:55', 'status': '2b', 'caller': '555-123-4567'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-10 23:59:12', 'status': '2c', 'caller': '555-555-0001'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-15 13:00:35', 'status': '2a', 'caller': '555-555-9876'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-15 20:32:07', 'status': '2g', 'caller': '555-123-4567'},\r\n]\r\n\r\n# IMPORTANT: Replace this value with a secret string of random words\r\n# and DO NOT disclose this secret.\r\nsecret = \"willow dog forbearance hiccup nonsense ant index\".encode('UTF-8')\r\n\r\n# Iterate over the raw data record and print it in the requested representation\r\nfor entry in data:\r\n    source = entry['caller'].encode('UTF-8')\r\n    privacy_id = hmac.digest(secret, source, hashlib.sha256).hex()\r\n\r\n    output = 'Timestamp: {:s}, Status: {:s}, Source: {:s}'\r\n    print(output.format(entry['ts'], entry['status'], privacy_id))\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe requester of this information is willing to provide pro bono technical education and assistance with respect to this request, in a manner consistent with any specified IT restrictions and limitations.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Victoria:\r\n\r\nI have received this request.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur process is to ask the member(s) to review their records for records which may apply to this request. In addition, we ask the legislature's computer center staff to run a search of the legislative email accounts of the person or persons, if any, to locate any emails in those accounts that are responsive to the request. The computer staff segregates the person's mailboxes, runs the search inquiries using the terms or information you supplied covering the request period and provides those search results to me. The computer searches are run by a joint (House and Senate) computer staff and can only be run one-at-a-time and in the order received. There are currently several Senate searches that pre-date this one for the Senate alone. I do not know how many House of Representatives searches are currently in the queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the computer staff's segregation of emails, and the person\u2019s segregation of records, I then must review the email located within the mailboxes which are identified using the search terms you provided to: (1) remove all non-public records, i.e. e-mails that have nothing to do with conducting the public's business, and (2) identify the emails that are protected speech under our constitutional privilege contained in LA Constitution Art. III, \u00a7 8. After identification of any privileged e-mails, if any, I discuss each privileged record with any person or associated member to ascertain whether that member will waive or assert the privilege on each identified record. If the member asserts this privilege, I must then remove those from the documents from other records that could be produced. This process results in a set of records which is then made available for inspection and copying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate charges $0.25 per page for copies plus the cost of shipping. The charge applies whether records are reproduced and mailed, downloaded, or emailed (minus the cost of mailing).\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYolanda Dixon\r\nSecretary of the Senate\r\n225-342-6184\r\ndixony@legis.la.gov",
