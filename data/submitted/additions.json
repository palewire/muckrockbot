Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking any datasets, databases, and/or spreadsheets sufficient to show the following information regarding every current or former public employee in Hawaii, year-by-year, dating back however far as the data exist for:\r\n\r\nFirst name\r\nMiddle name or initial\r\nLast name\r\nUnique ERS identification number\r\nRace\r\nGender\r\nYear of birth\r\nLast job title\r\nAll public employing agencies\r\nDates of employment with each agency\r\nMinimum & maximum pension benefit\r\n\r\nIf your system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc.\r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nJournalist\r\nInvisible Institute\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow",
