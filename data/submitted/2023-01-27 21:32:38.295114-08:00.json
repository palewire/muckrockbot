Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B).

Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Crillon C. Payne, II, aka Crillon Payne, aka Cril Payne  (May 28, 1943 \u2013 June 18, 2006). Mr. Payne worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1968 and 1976 as an undercover agent investigating domestic terrorist groups in the antiwar movement. He wrote a memoir about his experiences of his time at the Bureau which was published by Newsweek Books in 1979 as \"Deep Cover: An FBI Agent Infiltrates the Radical Underground\". In the book, Mr. Payne states that he was given informant designation \"LA 7852-S (Extremist)\" as part of a Domestic Intelligence Division operation known as the Special Informant Development Program (SPECTAR). According to Mr. Payne, this operation was created to target terrorist group the Weather Underground. As such, I am requesting all records related to Mr. Payne under all previously stated permutations of his name, LA 7852-S (Extremist), and LA 7852-S.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Payne's privacy, as he passed away on June 18, 2006. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Payne's obituary in the Austin American-Statesman. For expediency's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/statesman/name/crillon-payne-obituary?id=26854114\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Payne publicly revealed his work with the the Bureau in his memoir, removing any further concerns over privacy. The fact that he published a memoir about his undercover work would also make him a figure of public interest; \"Deep Cover\" received media attention in national newspapers and on radio stations at the time of its publication.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. David Crosby, aka David Van Cortlandt Crosby (August 14, 1941 \u2013 January 18, 2023). Mr. Crosby was a musician in rock groups The Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, among others, and during his time in these bands he participated in antiwar protests targeting the Vietnam War. Mr. Crosby's political activism and status as a popular musician make him a figure of public interest. Any Bureau files on Mr. Crosby would provide the public with a better understanding of the Bureau's relationship with the counterculture in the sixties and seventies.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Crosby's privacy, as he passed away on January 18, 2023. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Crosby's obituary in the New York Times. For expediency's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/arts/music/david-crosby-dead.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
