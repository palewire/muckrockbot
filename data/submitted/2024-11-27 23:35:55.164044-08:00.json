According to a document released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Ronin 3.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Ronin 3,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

According to documents released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production in 2022. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Previously released records indicate Durham was the subject of wiretapping and had at least one informant reporting on his activities. The following symbol sources were directed at Durham between 1954 and 1956: CG 5974-S, CG 5985-S, CG 6040-S* (https://archive.org/details/FBI-ELSUR-nsia/18-cv-01868%20pp%202770-3077%20-%20ELSUR%20Indices%20-%20Chicago%20Section%204/page/n299/mode/2up; https://archive.org/details/FBI-ELSUR-nsia/18-cv-01868%20pp%203298-2482%20-%20ELSUR%20Indices%20-%20Chicago%20Section%206/page/n93/mode/2up) Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/chicagosuntimes/name/earl-durham-obituary?id=29644078 (This is a reprint of an obituary that originally appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times); https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=10&SessionID=76&GA=95&DocTypeID=SR&DocNum=422&LegID=48589&SpecSess=&Session= (Illinois State Senate resolution commemorating Durham)\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G.

I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne.

Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry or FBI association with a prominent Seattle-area boxer and associate of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party named Kenno Carlos. Kenno Carlos is deceased and thus privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. Mr. Kenno Carlos was born on November 28th of 1938 in Capitol Heights in Maryland, and died on December 29th of 2008. A photograph of his headstone and burial plot in the Forest Lawn cemetery in Seattle is available online: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/159350303/kenno-carlos\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd of 1968 Kenno Carlos was arrested in a flag burning episode in Seattle that made local news: https://www.historylink.org/File/1456\r\n\r\nAccording to evidence presented by the House Committee on Internal Security in 1970, Mr. Kenno Carlos of Seattle was included in a publicly released list of individuals, \"identified as Seattle Panther Party members or associates who, at various times between April 1968 and March 1970, participated in Panther functions regularly.\" A link to that document from the House Committee on Internal Security can be found here: https://blackfreedom.proquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blackpanther20.pdf\r\n\r\nOther known aliases for Kenno Carlos, according to the congressional report, include the names Joseph Edward Hall and Charlie Reno. In December of 1972 news articles describe Kenno Carlos boxing under the name \"Big\" Charlie Reno: https://www.boxingforum24.com/threads/ken-norton-vs-big-charlie-reno-december-13-1972.433709/ \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the boxer Kenno Carlos from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Kenno Carlos held by the Seattle office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Kenno Carlos.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases (including \"Joseph Edward Hall\" and \"Charlie Reno\"), nicknames (\"Big Charlie\"), code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Kenno Carlos.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Kenno Carlos. Possible bureau documentation on Kenno Carlos would likely include the flag burning episode and associated media coverage, Black Panther material and documents, etc. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together in having this request resolved. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

In most cases, your request will be processed in two to four weeks, or sooner.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City may invoke an extension of time to determine if there is a need to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search for and collect the requested records from field facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search for and examine a voluminous number of records.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Consult with another agency or City departments having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Compile data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your request is to review records (rather than receive copies), an appointment will be made with you for review once the records are gathered.\u00a0 Please note:\u00a0 If any responsive documents are copyrighted they can only be viewed in house.\u00a0 No duplicate or photos are allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a charge for the direct cost of duplication pursuant to the City\u2019s Book of fees. Payment must be made prior to release of records requested. If the documents requested exceed 50 pages, a deposit may be requested.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords available for review and/or copies of records requested will be available for 10 days after notification of their availability. If you are unable to pick-up or view your records during this time period, notification is required or your request will be considered fulfilled and a new request must be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain records are generally exempt for disclosure pursuant to Government Code Section 6255, where the public interest served by not making the records public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the records. The Government Code further provides that certain other records are specifically exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANET CHAPAN, MMC\r\n\r\n\r\nSr. Deputy City Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n1110 W.
