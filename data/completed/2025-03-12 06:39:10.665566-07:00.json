For example, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (2019), the court ruled that the government could not withhold or redact records related to the CIA's use of drone strikes. Additionally, in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy (2020), the court ruled that the government must release certain records related to climate change policy.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to the following records:\r\n\r\nArchitectural drawings and blueprints of The Cadet Chapel, including any revisions or updates made over the past 10 years.\r\nRecords related to the construction and maintenance of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any contracts or agreements with contractors and vendors.\r\nRecords related to the funding of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any budget reports or financial statements.\r\nAny records related to events or ceremonies held at The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including guest lists, program materials, and photographs.\r\nTo facilitate your search for the requested documents, please let me know if there are any specific offices or departments that may hold the requested documents.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you do not redact, withhold, or delete any responsive records. If any documents are withheld or redacted, I will seek a court order to compel their release. Please note that the government's obligation to disclose records under FOIA is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, and I urge you to fully comply with my request.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make a special request for any records related to the history and significance of The Cadet Chapel at West Point. As a landmark building with a rich history, I am interested in learning more about the cultural and historical significance of The Cadet Chapel, and any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department conducted a query and has identified email communications that are currently under review for any information exempt under various provisions of the CPRA. The Department will provide you with a determination and an estimated date of rolling production of non-exempt email communications responsive to your request, if applicable, in August 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in January 2025.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Government Code Sections 7927.700 and 7927.705. Section 7927.700 exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Section 7927.705 exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to provisions of the Penal Code. Penal Code Section 832.7(a) states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.

The names of deputies who work in undercover, plain clothes positions that demand anonymity were removed pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000. Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court, 42 Cal.4th 278, 301 (2007). The anonymity of these deputies is essential to their safety and effectiveness, and warrants exempting their identity and information about their position from disclosure. The public interest served by not disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the information.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request to include badge numbers, serial numbers, currently no roster with the information sought in the format you have requested exists. Historical reports do not include badge numbers.  A public agency is not required to generate new substantive content or create inventories of data in response to a records request. Sander v. Superior Court (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 651.  Therefore, the Sheriff's Office is providing the rosters with names and stations.\r\n\r\nYour request is now closed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErica Duarte, Administrative Analyst\r\n\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\"",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

(https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations) \r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.\u00a0 Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations,\u00a0CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\u00a0 Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.\u00a0 Currently, the average time to process a FOIA request related to \"travel/border incidents\" is a minimum of 2-4 months. We truly appreciate your continued patience. \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit (http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia) http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia.

Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/facial-recognition-technology. Specifically, page 31 of the section 'Facial Recognition Part 1' (https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2024-Apr/Facial Recognition Part 1.pdf) \nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-2020-041143 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

In order to obtain a copy of a video, you must first initiate a civil action or file a Petition For Release (AOC form CV-270) with the Mecklenburg County Clerk of Court. Once the Petition for Release has been filed with the courthouse, a file-stamped copy of the Petition may be served on CMPD through the Police Attorney's office at: CMPD Police Attorney office 601 E Trade St Charlotte, NC 28202 \r\n  \r\n Disclosure of Recordings (Viewing ONLY) \r\n  \r\n As noted above, N.C.G.S. 132-1.4A also states that certain persons are entitled to disclosures, or viewings, of law enforcement recordings. This does not include getting a copy of the recordings. By statute, those persons are: \r\n  \r\n A person whose image or voice is in the recording. \r\n A spouse if the spouse whose image or voice is in the recording consents to the disclosure. Notarization of the request form is required by the consenting spouse. \r\n An attorney retained to represent a person whose image or voice is in the recording. Notarization of the request form by the client is required. \r\n A parent of a minor whose image or voice is in the recording. \r\n A guardian of a minor or adult whose image or voice is in the recording. Guardianship documentation is required. \r\n A personal representative of a deceased person whose image or voice is in the recording. Executorship, Power of Attorney, or other legal documentation required. \r\n A personal representative of an adult person who is incapacitated and unable to provide consent to disclosure. Power of Attorney or other legal documentation required. \r\n  \r\n NOTE: the statute defines a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d as a parent, court-appointed guardian, spouse, or attorney of a person whose image or voice is in the recording. If a person whose image or voice is in the recording is deceased, the term also means the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person; the deceased person's surviving spouse, parent, or adult child; the deceased person's attorney; or the parent or guardian of a surviving minor child of the deceased. \r\n  \r\n \r\nIf you meet the criteria above you may download the Video Disclosure Request form using the link below. Once you have completed the form in its entirety you may bring it, along with the required verification documents, to any CMPD division office or the Law Enforcement Center. You may also email the form and documentation to VideoDisclosure@cmpd.org or you may mail the form and documentation by USPS to: \r\n  \r\n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department\r\nAttn: Video Disclosure\r\n601 East Trade Street Charlotte, NC 28202 \r\n  \r\n \r\nIf you would like to view a recording that depicts death or serious bodily injury, the statute requires you to complete a Request to Law Enforcement Agency to Disclose Recording of Death or Serious Bodily Injury (AOC form CV-275). This completed form can be sent directly to CMPD through the Police Attorney\u2019s Office.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the statute or the video request processes described above, you should visit www.nccourts.gov or contact a private attorney to assist you.\r\n\r\nDownload the Video Disclosure Request Form\r\n\r\nView the NC General Statute - Chapter 132 \u00a71.4A \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department\r\nPublic Records Request Unit\r\nPolice Attorney\u2019s Office\r\n601 East Trade Street\r\nCharlotte, NC 28202\r\nwww.cmpd.org",

On May 20, 2024, your office made a partial release of records, delivered by Matthew Gomez. On June 3, 2024, your office closed the request. On June 5, 2020, your office reopened the request when I pointed out you only provided records responsive to one of the two items I sought. Mr. Gomez subsequently sought a date range for the request. On August 23, 2024, I provided that date range. On August 29, 2024, your office notified me that a search produced more then 200 GB of data. On August 30, 2024, I asked for the metadata from these emails in lieu of the emails themselves. On September 6, 2024, your office informed me your IT department could not provide metadata for the emails. You proposed an alternate search methodology aimed at narrowing the results. I accepted that proposal on September 9, 2024. On December 31, 2024, Yvette Gurule informed me the city was experiencing a high volume of requests, and told me I would not receive these records until they became available. On February 10, 2024, your office sent a similar message. This time, you office informed me that if I didn\u2019t respond by February 14, you would close the request. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records associated with processing of my IPRA request by these individuals on these dates, as well as any other processing information, including the communications with your IT department regarding metadata.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nIf your department does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian\u2019s name and address.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

To avoid any unwarranted invasions of privacy, I\u2019m specifically seeking the de-identified, aggregate data annually from January 1, 2020, through January 1, 2025, including the following: \r\n   1. The number of adolescent offenders, as well as juvenile offenders, including those granted youthful offender status, under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\r\n   2. Offender demographics including: total arrest dispositions, age at the time of offense, race, gender, and county convicted/adjudicated.\r\n   3. If collected in the same data, demographics of the victim including: age, gender, and race.\r\n   4. If collected in the same data, number of petitions filed and status (approved/denied/in progress). \r\nI ask that, if possible, you provide any potentially responsive records as an electronic spreadsheet or searchable database format. Should you deny this request in whole or in part, I ask that you detail your reasons for doing so in writing, citing the applicable statutes.\r\nThis information is being sought in the regular course of newsgathering on behalf of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism for dissemination to the general public. \r\nI\u2019m requesting that you waive any fees associated with production of potentially responsive records. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how the state and local authorities work together to monitor sex offender status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Rudenberg, a citizen of Delaware, in coordination with Maria Guinnip.",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

Records of ICE-Related Enforcement Actions in New Rochelle\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any incident reports, arrest logs, call logs, or visitor logs documenting:\r\n\t\u2022\tICE agents visiting NRPD facilities or requesting assistance from officers.\r\n\t\u2022\tNRPD officers participating in immigration enforcement operations with ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny individuals arrested, detained, or transferred to ICE custody as a result of NRPD cooperation.\r\n\t\u2022\tComplaints, investigations, or internal reviews regarding potential civil rights violations linked to ICE-related operations.\r\n\r\n5. Metadata for Electronic Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tFor all emails or electronic messages responsive to this request, I request metadata including:\r\n\t\u2022\tSender and recipient information.\r\n\t\u2022\tTimestamps of messages exchanged.\r\n\t\u2022\tSubject lines and attachment details.\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for Disclosure\r\n\r\nThis FOIL request aligns with Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2), which grants the public a presumptive right to access government records. Courts have ruled that law enforcement agencies must disclose non-exempt information to ensure government accountability (Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the public\u2019s right to scrutinize government operations. Given the ongoing national debate over local police cooperation with ICE, the public has a compelling interest in understanding NRPD\u2019s role in immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nNew York State has implemented sanctuary policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, and this request seeks to determine whether NRPD policies comply with these state-level protections (Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980)).\r\n\r\nObligation to Preserve and Provide Records\r\n\r\nUnder Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993), government entities must preserve records subject to public disclosure laws. Accordingly, I request that no responsive records be deleted, altered, or destroyed while this FOIL request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all applicable fees for processing this request. Disclosure of these records serves the public interest by promoting government transparency and accountability and is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Dep\u2019t, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers should be granted when disclosure benefits the general public.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 in processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs will exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nDue to heightened public concern over immigration enforcement and civil rights issues, I request expedited processing of this FOIL request. Under Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980), timely disclosure of records affecting public safety and civil liberties is essential for government oversight.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect an acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days and an estimated timeline for disclosure.\r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic copies of records whenever possible. If any records are withheld or redacted, I request a written explanation citing specific legal exemptions in accordance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nShould you require any clarification or additional details, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

The denial was issued under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g), which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency materials. However, this exemption was misapplied, as my request explicitly seeks finalized documents, factual data, and external communications that do not qualify for exemption under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFOIL\u2019s Legislative Intent & Improper Invocation of \u00a7 87(2)(g)\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s FOIL operates under a presumption of access, meaning that all government records are presumed public unless a specific exemption applies. Courts have narrowly construed exemptions to prevent unjustified secrecy. See Westchester Rockland Newspapers, Inc. v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980) (\u201cFOIL is based on a presumption of access, and its exemptions must be narrowly interpreted\u201d).\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g) does not apply here because:\r\n\t1.\tInter-agency or intra-agency communications exemption does not cover factual data, final policies, or external agency interactions.\r\n\t\u2022\tI requested communications between the New Rochelle Police Department and ICE, a federal agency, not internal deliberations. Once shared with an external entity, these records are no longer exempt under \u00a7 87(2)(g).\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts have ruled that communications exchanged between local police and external federal agencies are not protected under inter-agency exemptions. See Matter of City of Newark v. Law Dep\u2019t of the City of New York, 305 A.D.2d 28 (1st Dep\u2019t 2003) (holding that communications exchanged between NYPD and federal agencies must be disclosed).\r\n\t2.\tFinal policies, agreements, and MOUs must be disclosed.\r\n\t\u2022\tFOIL mandates disclosure of final determinations, agreements, or policies.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request explicitly included MOUs and funding arrangements, which are final agency decisions and must be released under New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1543 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 2017).\r\n\t\u2022\tAny agreements with ICE impact the rights of the public, and withholding them violates Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. NYS Dep\u2019t of Correctional Servs., 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990) (holding that public contracts and agreements must be disclosed).\r\n\t3.\tStatistical and factual data are not exempt under FOIL.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request sought records of ICE-related enforcement actions, which contain statistical and factual data and must be released per Matter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454 (2007) (holding that agencies must disclose factual information even if embedded in otherwise exempt records).\r\n\t\u2022\tAny metadata, timestamps, sender/recipient information, or subject lines of emails between ICE and New Rochelle PD constitute factual records, which are explicitly required to be disclosed under Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\t4.\tDirecting me to an online manual does not satisfy FOIL obligations.\r\n\t\u2022\tThe response referencing the Manual of Procedure does not satisfy FOIL\u2019s requirement to provide direct access to records.\r\n\t\u2022\tMatter of Thomas v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Educ., 103 A.D.3d 495 (1st Dep\u2019t 2013), explicitly rejected an agency\u2019s attempt to avoid providing records by merely directing requesters to a website.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records & Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\n\r\nI formally demand that the New Rochelle Police Department and City of New Rochelle preserve all responsive records while this appeal is pending. Any destruction, alteration, or deletion of records responsive to this request may constitute a violation of state and federal law.\r\n\t\u2022\tSee Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that agencies must preserve all records potentially subject to disclosure).\r\n\t\u2022\tUnder Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(8), any attempt to willfully withhold records in bad faith could lead to judicial intervention and legal penalties.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Disclosure\r\n\r\nGiven the above legal arguments and established case law, I request that the denial be reversed immediately and that the records be provided in electronic format within the statutory timeframe.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the records is withheld, I request that you provide a written explanation detailing the legal grounds for withholding, citing specific case law, in compliance with Gould v.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of the Department\u2019s rolling production. At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in December 2024.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not conduct of the Department's business are being withheld or provided with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLastly, please be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Batch 1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that this is the final release of the Department\u2019s rolling production.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not conduct of the Department's business are being withheld or provided with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLastly, please be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being withheld or are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

At least 7 people detained in the same area as Mr. Dumitrascu declared under oath that his care was delayed by CoreCivic staff.\r\n4. Multiple individuals detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death declared under oath that CoreCivic shut off telephone lines in the hours following his death -- preventing them from communicating what happened.\r\n5. At least one person detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death alleged CoreCivic and ICE accelerated the process of his removal in retaliation for attempting to share information about the death.\r\n6. CoreCivic facilities have previously been fined for negligence and contract violations that preceded deaths in ICE custody. See, e.g., https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24529304-stewart-contract-discrepancy-dec-2018.\r\n7. At least 55 deaths have occurred at CoreCivic's ICE facilities since 2003--more than any other ICE contractor.\r\n8. Since early 2017, ICE ceased affirmatively publishing detainee death reviews, forcing families to file FOIAs and sue when their loved ones die in order to obtain basic information on the government's findings.\r\n9. Congress recently approved the expansion of ICE detention by more than 20% -- up 7,500 beds to 41,500 funded.\r\n10. DHS and the present administration proposed cuts to inspection budgets for ICE detention centers, rendering the public less able to assess the lethality of ICE detention operations, including those at Otay Mesa.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Your request was received in this office on 4/3/2024. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 4/3/2024.  You have requested copy of the ICE Health Services Corps Mortality Review for Cristian Dumitrascu, who died at the CoreCivic Otay Mesa Detention Center on March 5, 2023. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAngela Flores \n\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist\n",
