        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the thousand oaks police Department\u2019s use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the Department\u2019s use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the department\u2019s aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the department used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the Department\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Garland, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice\r\nKristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, DOJ\r\nMichael E. Horowitz, Inspector General, DOJ\r\nXavier Becerra, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, Administrator, CMS\r\nAlina M. Semo, Director, OGIS\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis appeal addresses the improper handling of my FOIA request (originally submitted on November 23, 2024) and the failure to comply with ADA-mandated accommodations. The District of Columbia Department of Health incorrectly identified itself as the agency responsible for processing the request, resulting in unnecessary delays. Furthermore, the response fails to meet statutory obligations for ADA accommodations, transparency, and procedural fairness under both federal and District law.\r\n\r\nKey Issues\r\n1. Misrouting of FOIA Request\r\nThe FOIA request explicitly sought records from federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), not from the District of Columbia government. It is concerning that:\r\n\r\nThe DC Department of Health did not recognize this jurisdictional error upon receipt and failed to proactively forward the request to the appropriate federal agency. Example: \u201cThe agency's failure to forward my FOIA request violates FOIA\u2019s 20-business-day response requirement under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i).\u201d\r\nThe District has stopped the processing clock and redirected the burden of correction back to the requester, despite clear principles under FOIA and ADA requiring assistance to ensure timely access to records.\r\n2. Failure to Provide ADA Accommodations \u201cFOIA and ADA regulations require public entities to provide reasonable assistance to ensure accessibility, particularly for individuals with documented disabilities.\u201d\r\nMy original request included explicit ADA accommodations, which have been ignored:\r\n\r\nMuckRock Platform Only: Communications must be routed exclusively through MuckRock. This request has been disregarded, forcing the use of inaccessible external portals.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs: Requested records must be in accessible formats. The response failed to confirm adherence to this requirement.\r\nSimplified Summaries: Complex documents require simplified summaries, which have not been provided.\r\n3. Procedural and Constitutional Violations\r\nThe mishandling of my request infringes upon my constitutional and statutory rights:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Denial of access to requested records obstructs my right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\nFifth Amendment: Delayed responses and failure to provide accommodations violate my procedural due process rights.\r\nADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: By not fulfilling the requested accommodations, your response discriminates against me as an individual with a documented disability.\r\nRelief Requested \u201cAs established in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), public agencies must ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to governmental processes and information.\u201d\r\nTo rectify these issues, I demand the following actions:\r\n\r\n1. Immediate Forwarding of the FOIA Request\r\nThe DC Department of Health must immediately forward my FOIA request to the appropriate federal agency:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \u2013 Office of Information Policy (OIP)\r\n2. Full ADA Compliance\r\nEnsure all future communications comply with ADA and Rehabilitation Act requirements:\r\n\r\nUse the MuckRock platform exclusively for all communications.\r\nProvide all responsive documents in screen-reader-compatible PDF formats, clearly labeled.\r\nInclude simplified summaries of technical or complex documents.\r\n3. Identification of Responsible Personnel\r\nProvide the full names, titles, and roles of all individuals involved in processing this request. Transparency is a cornerstone of both FOIA and public trust.\r\n\r\n4. Statutory Justifications for Delays and Denials\r\nProvide detailed statutory justifications for any delays, denials, or redactions, citing specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) or relevant District codes.  \u201cThe explicit reference to the U.S. Department of Justice in the subject line and body of my request clearly delineates the intended recipient. The failure to identify and correct this jurisdictional error demonstrates systemic procedural negligence.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the urgency of public interest in ADA enforcement, Medicaid oversight, and whistleblower protections, I demand expedited processing of this appeal. \u201cUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), whistleblower protections are violated when individuals are obstructed from reporting systemic failures in governance and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nConsequences of Continued Non-Compliance\r\nIf the above issues are not resolved within 10 business days, I will escalate this matter through all available legal and administrative channels:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) and the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG).\r\nJudicial Remedies: Pursuing injunctive relief and damages for violations of FOIA, ADA, and constitutional rights.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic non-compliance to oversight committees, advocacy organizations, and media outlets.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal is submitted with an expectation of immediate corrective action to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and accessibility enshrined in federal and District law. Given the urgency of the matter and its public interest implications, I request a resolution within 10 business days. Failure to comply will result in formal escalation to oversight bodies and judicial forums to ensure justice and systemic reform.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue. I look forward to your prompt response.This appeal underscores the importance of transparency, accessibility, and accountability in public governance. I expect the requested actions to be addressed promptly and fully. Failure to act will only exacerbate public mistrust and systemic inefficiencies.\r\n\u201cThis request is essential to addressing systemic failures in ADA enforcement, Medicaid oversight, and whistleblower protections, directly impacting vulnerable populations and taxpayer accountability.\u201d\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf. https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf\r\nhttps://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\nDB42131inf\r\n\r\nCC\r\nMerrick Garland\r\nTitle: U.S. Attorney General\r\nEmail: askdoj@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: DOJ operations, FOIA compliance, ADA enforcement.\r\n\r\nKristen Clarke\r\nTitle: Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division\r\nEmail: civilrights.justice@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: ADA enforcement and civil rights compliance.\r\n\r\nBobak Talebian\r\nTitle: Director, Office of Information Policy (DOJ)\r\nEmail: oip.foia@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: DOJ FOIA policy and appeals.\r\n\r\nMichael E.

Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions.

Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions. Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the foundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal mandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can overcome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.",

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following.\r\n\r\nYour request is being preprocessed to another open request on the same subject, meaning a request on the same subject had been received and was already in process prior to receipt of your request.  To avoid duplicative efforts, you will receive the same releases at the same time as the original requester for this subject.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Interim releases are generally made for complex requests.\r\n\r\nYou have the opportunity to reduce the scope of your request; this will accelerate the process and could potentially place your request in a quicker processing queue.  This may also allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  The FBI uses a multi-track processing system to fairly assign and process new requests.  Simple track cases (50 pages or less) usually require the least time to process.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is considered a complex case in our large track.  Please advise us in writing if you would like to discuss reducing the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.",

Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many of the requested records are likely exempt from disclosure pursuant to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records containing information the University acquired in confidence and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 1040, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that pertain to pending litigation to which the University is a party (Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.200);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Correspondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor\u2019s office (Govt. Code 7928.000\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Preliminary drafts or notes that are not retained by the University in the ordinary course of business are protected from disclosure because the public interest in withholding those records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Govt. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7927.500 and 7922.000);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUCOP CPRA Office\n",

Please note that student names and identifying information was redacted pursuant to FERPA, and private email addresses/phone numbers were redacted for privacy purposes.\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining records you requested are exempt from disclosure as specified below. However, we will be proving you a final, 2nd batch of responsive, redacted records within 3 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nIn a recent city council meeting (https://sanmateo.primegov.com/Portal/Meeting?meetingTemplateId=8018) Amendment No. 3 to the master services and purchasing agreement with Axon Enterprise, Inc. was approved for use of a Skydio X10 drone and associated Skydio Remote Flight Deck Software. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I hereby request the following records, from Jan 01, 2024 to the processing of this request: \r\n\r\n1) Any digital communications (including but not limited to emails and text messages) as well as documents, (including but not limited to PDF, word processing, excel, and slide documents) that mention \"Skydio\", \"X10\", or \"Remote Flight Deck\". This includes communications from Skydio, Axon Enterprise, Inc., or any other external entities that may have been consulted. Please include all attachments. \r\n\r\n2) All instructional materials, presentations and presentation materials (including recorded video and audio, and PowerPoint files), and other guidance on the features and use of Skydio drones. This can exclude notes taken during meetings, but should include A) any explanations (whether internally or externally generated) of how Skydio works, and B) any other document that has been used to help explain the use of Skydio, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries. \r\n\r\n3) A copy of any materials related to evaluation of the addition of Skydio equipment (such as possible effects on privacy impact assessments, use policies, standard operating procedures, or data retention policies) not covered by (1) (such as meeting notes not captured in email). \r\n\r\nI also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, XLS, or PPT file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nEwen Cheslack-Postava \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsan-mateo-police-department-7497%252Fskydioaxon-communications-and-materials-san-mateo-police-department-176388%252F%253Femail%253Dpolice%252540cityofsanmateo.org&url_auth_token=AAAgEkL9-JfKayADniIhBTFArhk%3A1tDDa8%3Ao1tFXbOEGdGP7TARbPAOo6iJPl_-J13DEpQpQ9XVddA We are reaching out to inform you that a legal review of your request was completed by our City Attorney\u2019s office, in accordance with Government Code \u00a7 7922.525(b). You will find responsive communications and documents attached to this request. Please note, much of the Skydio training material is proprietary to Skydio and not retained by the Department.

For approval recommendations that are still pending at this time of this inquiry, how many days have they been pending since the Advisory Board of Pardons' recommendation to the Governor (or since what date have they been pending with the Governor).\r\n\r\nI am seeking statistical information, not personal information, so it is fine with me if applicants' names are redacted.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

ISP acknowledges receipt of your FOIA request received on December 20, 2024. A reasonable search for the requested records was conducted. ISP has included all responsive records that were located.\r\n\r\nISP is providing Investigative Report #22-41378100046. The requested records that ISP is providing are too voluminous to be sent via email; thus, they have been uploaded to the secure Microsoft Teams SharePoint Server and will be available for download at your convenience for the next 365 days here.\r\n\r\nFor the portion of your request concerning emails, ISP was unable to perform a search for emails based on the provided search terms. We invite you to submit a new request with more information that includes, but it not limited to, a list of keywords or phrases and date range.\r\n\r\nISP is granting your request in part and denying your request in part. The request was denied in part because some of the information in the records required redaction and/or were exempt from disclosure. The basis for the ISP\u0092s decision in this matter is as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(a) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: (a) Information specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing federal or State law.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a)).\r\n\r\nDisclosure of some of the records you have requested is prohibited by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing such laws.\r\n\r\n20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d): \u0093LEADS data shall not be disseminated to any individual or organization that is not legally authorized to have access to the information.\u0094 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d)).\r\n\r\nInformation gathered for the Law Enforcement Agency Data System (LEADS) cannot be provided to you because the dissemination of LEADS information to non-law enforcement persons and entities is prohibited.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(b) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: (b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law, or a court order.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)).\r\n\r\nDocuments containing private information, as defined in 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5) have been redacted.\r\n\r\nSection 7.5(bb) of FOIA: \u0093Statutory exemptions. To the extent provided for by the statutes referenced below, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: \r\n (bb) Information which is or was prohibited from disclosure by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7.5(bb)).\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement records concerning specific minors under 18 years of age are exempt from public inspection and may not be disclosed to the public except by order of the court.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(c) of FOIA: \u0093Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u0091Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u0092 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u0092s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c)).\r\n\r\nDocuments containing personal information which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy have been redacted.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(d)(vi) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: \r\n (d) Records in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would: \r\n (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person.\u0094\r\n\r\nReleasing a portion of the requested records that outlines officer beat shifts or assignments would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to review by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) in the Office of the Attorney General (5 ILCS 140/9.5(a)). You may reach the PAC at:\r\n\r\n500 S. 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62701\r\n(877) 299-3642\r\npublic.access@ilag.gov\r\n\r\nYou also have the right to judicial review under 5 ILCS 140/11.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler\r\nIllinois State Police\r\nFreedom of Information Officer\r\n801 South 7th Street, Suite 1000-S\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62703\r\nISP.FOIA.Officer@Illinois.gov",

Your request was received on October 22, 2024, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-0148-F. You requested the following:\r\n\r\nInformation on job listings on the USAJOBS.gov website.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires OPM to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches of multiple program offices and possible consultations with agencies that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, OPM will invoke a 10 business-day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow OPM to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"all other\" requester. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.103(d). In this fee category, you are responsible for search costs incurred after the first 2 free hours and for duplication costs after the first 100 pages of records are copied free. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(b) and (c). No fee will be assessed if the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than $25. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(d)(1).\r\n\r\nA search will be initiated by OPM for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA Analyst in this office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding your request, please contact Jonathan Griffie at jonathan.griffie@opm.gov<mailto:jonathan.griffie@opm.gov>.\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding OPM's FOIA program, please refer to the information available on our website at https://www.opm.gov/information-management/freedom-of-information-act/.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you with this matter.\r\nSincerely,\r\nFreedom of Information Act Requester Service Center\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat, Privacy, and Information Management\r\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management\r\nTelephone: (202) 606-3642\r\nE-mail: FOIA@opm.gov<mailto:FOIA@opm.gov>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB2563.4A88F040]\r\n\r\nFollow us on LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/opm> | Twitter<https://twitter.com/usopm> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/usopm>\n",
