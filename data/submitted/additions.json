        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau documents related to Zurab Konstantinovich Tsereteli (Georgian: \u10d6\u10e3\u10e0\u10d0\u10d1 \u10ec\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8). Tsereteli's (born January 4th 1934 - died April 22nd 2025) recent death was widely reported in the news media. A copy of his obituary in the New York Times should be attached and can be found online here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/zurab-tsereteli-dead.html\r\n\r\nTsereteli was President of the Russian Academy of Arts at the time of his death. Tsereteli was a controversial figure in his homeland of Georgia, where he was banned from entry for many years due to his closeness with Putin. In addition, Tsereteli was also involved in a plan to install a massive statue of Christopher Columbus in the New York City area. \r\n\r\nAllegations of Tsereteli's connections to organized crime have been widely reported: https://sethhettena.com/2017/05/04/trump-and-the-sculptor-a-tale-of-corruption-organized-crime-and-murder/\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records about Zurab Tsereteli from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Tsereteli held by the New York or San Juan field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Zurab Tsereteli. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Zurab Tsereteli. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
