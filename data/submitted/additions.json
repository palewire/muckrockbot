Earlier this month, I requested records on James M. Robertson, the deceased former leader of the Spartacist League, from the FBI. The bureau wrote back in a letter, which you may find attached below, that some of the records have been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration.\r\n\r\nTherefore, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request electronic copies of the following records:\r\n- The previously processed record 100-HQ-436291 serial 162\r\n- FBI records on James M. Robertson or his Spartacist League contained in: 100-HQ-360207, 100-SF-29919, 100-HQ-444608, 100-HQ-441758, 100-HQ-430386, 100-HQ-16, 100-HQ-437041, 100-HQ-442786, 100-HQ-443643, 100-HQ-443560, 100-HQ-444237, 100-HQ-444526, 100-HQ-444608, 100-HQ-444715, 100-HQ-445310, 100-HQ-445489, 100-HQ-447775, 100-HQ-469300, 100-HQ-355091, 100-HQ-421187, 100, HQ-423720, 100-HQ-435926, 100-HQ-437702, 100-HQ-438855, 100-HQ-439570, 100-HQ-443973, 100-HQ-444363, 100-HQ-444623, 100-HQ-445395, 100-HQ-445695, 100-HQ-447241, 100-HQ-459811, 100-HQ-464548, 100-HQ-464595, 100-HQ-472046, 100-HQ-475856, 105-HQ-16345, 100-HQ-439190, 100-HQ-439769, 100-HQ-444664, and/or 100-HQ-447651 \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",
