I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) case files 105-HQ-8354  and 123-HQ-1568. A prior Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request, 1547783-000, was sent to the FBI for records on Christopher O. Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996), and the Bureau responded by identifying the aforementioned case file numbers as potentially responsive to the request and stating all subsequent records had been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Further, it recommended the filing of a FOIPA request through NARA's Special Access and Freedom of Information Act Program. Therefore, I am sending this request for access to FBI case files 105-HQ-8354  and 123-HQ-1568.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bird is identified in these records, there is no expectation of a violation of his privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
