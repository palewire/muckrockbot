I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination, and I have been granted expedited processing on this basis previously by federal FOIA agencies. Examples of my edited works are available here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/, here: https://atlpresscollective.com/author/free/, and here: https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/06/2024-07-01-ICE-Detainee-Deaths.pdf.\r\n2. As ICE has rapidly increased its detained noncitizen population since January 2025, mortality in ICE custody has also rapidly increased.\r\n3. ICE is presently on track to allow more people to die in the agency's custody than in any year since FY2020, when the COVID19 pandemic ripped through facilities claiming lives until federal judges ordered targeted depopulation over ICE's objections.\r\n\r\nTable 1: Publicly Reported Deaths in ICE Custody by Fiscal Year since PBNDS 2011 adoption.\r\nFY COUNT of FY\r\n11 10\r\n12 8\r\n13 9\r\n14 6\r\n15 7\r\n16 10\r\n17 12\r\n18 10\r\n19 9\r\n20 22\r\n21 5\r\n22 3\r\n23 4\r\n24 12\r\n25 10\r\n\r\n4. Public reports indicate Congress intends to appropriate a roughly 900% increase in ICE detention funding, spending $45 billion to expand the deadly detention system. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-administration-immigrant-detention-facilities-services.html.\r\n5. Timely access to information regarding healthcare outcomes in ICE custody is essential to public health researchers, medical experts, policymakers, and informed citizens who wish to have a meaningful role in the policy debate over whether the proposed budget increase represents a lawful and prudent expenditure of public resources.\r\n6. My previous FOIA work on ICE detention morbidity and mortality has resulted in obtaining records that have been shared with and cited by physicians, oversight agencies, Congress, and courts, influencing decisions that led to healthier outcomes for ICE's detained populations, and reducing the morbidity and mortality in ICE custody.\r\n7. There is an urgent need to inform the public regarding IHSC's capacity to manage and oversee medical emergencies and conditions that could lead to deaths of people in ICE custody.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request a fee waiver, as I will be publishing and circulating the results of the records I receive, and am not making this request for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your timely consideration of this time-sensitive request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
