I request the last three of such audits for all agencies the Missouri Highway Patrol is responsible for auditing under CJIS or other requirements.  This should include dates, reports, anomalies investigated, whether such anomalies were cleared or sustained, pass/fail results for the department, and the auditor who performed the audit.   I am not seeking audits of Highway Patrol itself.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael",
