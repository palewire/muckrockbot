I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nWhen completing this request, please prioritize whichever records would take the least amount of time to be located and released (rather than prioritizing whichever records are named first). \r\n\r\nAlso, please release documents on a rolling basis, as they become available. Also, I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method. Thanks again, and if there are any questions about my request, or if there\u2019s anything I can clarify, please contact me at chaskins@insider.com.
