Trump.\r\n\r\nThis request seeks to clarify the extent of New Rochelle Police Department\u2019s involvement in federal immigration enforcement and whether ICE has made requests, conducted operations, or received assistance from NRPD.\r\n\r\nScope of Request: Specific Records Sought\r\n\r\nI request copies of all relevant records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Communications Between New Rochelle Police Department and ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all emails, letters, faxes, text messages, internal memos, and reports exchanged between NRPD officers, detectives, supervisors, or administrative personnel and ICE agents or representatives from January 1, 2025, to the present regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tRequests for assistance in immigration enforcement operations in New Rochelle.\r\n\t\u2022\tICE detainers or holds placed on individuals arrested or detained by NRPD.\r\n\t\u2022\tJoint operations, task forces, or coordinated efforts between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicy discussions regarding the role of NRPD in federal immigration enforcement.\r\n\t\u2022\tRequests from ICE for personal data, residency information, or surveillance of specific individuals.\r\n\r\n2. New Rochelle Police Department Policies on ICE and Immigration Enforcement\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all policies, directives, and internal guidelines issued by NRPD regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tProcedures for responding to ICE requests for assistance, detainers, or arrests.\r\n\t\u2022\tLimitations, if any, on sharing information about individuals with federal immigration authorities.\r\n\t\u2022\tTraining materials for officers on handling ICE-related matters, including compliance with New York State\u2019s sanctuary laws.\r\n\t\u2022\tProtocols for handling situations where ICE agents seek access to individuals in police custody.\r\n\r\n3. Agreements, MOUs, and Funding Arrangements with ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), contracts, or agreements between NRPD and ICE, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny formal partnership agreements between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tParticipation in ICE\u2019s 287(g) program or any other federal immigration task forces.\r\n\t\u2022\tFederal grants, funding, or financial incentives received by NRPD related to immigration enforcement efforts.\r\n\r\n4. Records of ICE-Related Enforcement Actions in New Rochelle\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any incident reports, arrest logs, call logs, or visitor logs documenting:\r\n\t\u2022\tICE agents visiting NRPD facilities or requesting assistance from officers.\r\n\t\u2022\tNRPD officers participating in immigration enforcement operations with ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny individuals arrested, detained, or transferred to ICE custody as a result of NRPD cooperation.\r\n\t\u2022\tComplaints, investigations, or internal reviews regarding potential civil rights violations linked to ICE-related operations.\r\n\r\n5. Metadata for Electronic Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tFor all emails or electronic messages responsive to this request, I request metadata including:\r\n\t\u2022\tSender and recipient information.\r\n\t\u2022\tTimestamps of messages exchanged.\r\n\t\u2022\tSubject lines and attachment details.\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for Disclosure\r\n\r\nThis FOIL request aligns with Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2), which grants the public a presumptive right to access government records. Courts have ruled that law enforcement agencies must disclose non-exempt information to ensure government accountability (Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the public\u2019s right to scrutinize government operations. Given the ongoing national debate over local police cooperation with ICE, the public has a compelling interest in understanding NRPD\u2019s role in immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nNew York State has implemented sanctuary policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, and this request seeks to determine whether NRPD policies comply with these state-level protections (Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980)).\r\n\r\nObligation to Preserve and Provide Records\r\n\r\nUnder Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993), government entities must preserve records subject to public disclosure laws. Accordingly, I request that no responsive records be deleted, altered, or destroyed while this FOIL request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all applicable fees for processing this request. Disclosure of these records serves the public interest by promoting government transparency and accountability and is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Dep\u2019t, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers should be granted when disclosure benefits the general public.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 in processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs will exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nDue to heightened public concern over immigration enforcement and civil rights issues, I request expedited processing of this FOIL request. Under Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980), timely disclosure of records affecting public safety and civil liberties is essential for government oversight.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect an acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days and an estimated timeline for disclosure.\r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic copies of records whenever possible. If any records are withheld or redacted, I request a written explanation citing specific legal exemptions in accordance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nShould you require any clarification or additional details, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

The denial was issued under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g), which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency materials. However, this exemption was misapplied, as my request explicitly seeks finalized documents, factual data, and external communications that do not qualify for exemption under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFOIL\u2019s Legislative Intent & Improper Invocation of \u00a7 87(2)(g)\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s FOIL operates under a presumption of access, meaning that all government records are presumed public unless a specific exemption applies. Courts have narrowly construed exemptions to prevent unjustified secrecy. See Westchester Rockland Newspapers, Inc. v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980) (\u201cFOIL is based on a presumption of access, and its exemptions must be narrowly interpreted\u201d).\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g) does not apply here because:\r\n\t1.\tInter-agency or intra-agency communications exemption does not cover factual data, final policies, or external agency interactions.\r\n\t\u2022\tI requested communications between the New Rochelle Police Department and ICE, a federal agency, not internal deliberations. Once shared with an external entity, these records are no longer exempt under \u00a7 87(2)(g).\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts have ruled that communications exchanged between local police and external federal agencies are not protected under inter-agency exemptions. See Matter of City of Newark v. Law Dep\u2019t of the City of New York, 305 A.D.2d 28 (1st Dep\u2019t 2003) (holding that communications exchanged between NYPD and federal agencies must be disclosed).\r\n\t2.\tFinal policies, agreements, and MOUs must be disclosed.\r\n\t\u2022\tFOIL mandates disclosure of final determinations, agreements, or policies.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request explicitly included MOUs and funding arrangements, which are final agency decisions and must be released under New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1543 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 2017).\r\n\t\u2022\tAny agreements with ICE impact the rights of the public, and withholding them violates Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. NYS Dep\u2019t of Correctional Servs., 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990) (holding that public contracts and agreements must be disclosed).\r\n\t3.\tStatistical and factual data are not exempt under FOIL.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request sought records of ICE-related enforcement actions, which contain statistical and factual data and must be released per Matter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454 (2007) (holding that agencies must disclose factual information even if embedded in otherwise exempt records).\r\n\t\u2022\tAny metadata, timestamps, sender/recipient information, or subject lines of emails between ICE and New Rochelle PD constitute factual records, which are explicitly required to be disclosed under Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\t4.\tDirecting me to an online manual does not satisfy FOIL obligations.\r\n\t\u2022\tThe response referencing the Manual of Procedure does not satisfy FOIL\u2019s requirement to provide direct access to records.\r\n\t\u2022\tMatter of Thomas v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Educ., 103 A.D.3d 495 (1st Dep\u2019t 2013), explicitly rejected an agency\u2019s attempt to avoid providing records by merely directing requesters to a website.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records & Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\n\r\nI formally demand that the New Rochelle Police Department and City of New Rochelle preserve all responsive records while this appeal is pending. Any destruction, alteration, or deletion of records responsive to this request may constitute a violation of state and federal law.\r\n\t\u2022\tSee Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that agencies must preserve all records potentially subject to disclosure).\r\n\t\u2022\tUnder Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(8), any attempt to willfully withhold records in bad faith could lead to judicial intervention and legal penalties.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Disclosure\r\n\r\nGiven the above legal arguments and established case law, I request that the denial be reversed immediately and that the records be provided in electronic format within the statutory timeframe.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the records is withheld, I request that you provide a written explanation detailing the legal grounds for withholding, citing specific case law, in compliance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nRequired Response Format\r\n\r\nPlease respond directly via the MuckRock platform for proper tracking of this request and CC my personal email at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of the Department\u2019s rolling production. At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in December 2024.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not conduct of the Department's business are being withheld or provided with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLastly, please be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Batch 1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in the dissemination of information.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public about the circumstances of Mr. Dumitrascu's death.\r\n3. At least 7 people detained in the same area as Mr. Dumitrascu declared under oath that his care was delayed by CoreCivic staff.\r\n4. Multiple individuals detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death declared under oath that CoreCivic shut off telephone lines in the hours following his death -- preventing them from communicating what happened.\r\n5. At least one person detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death alleged CoreCivic and ICE accelerated the process of his removal in retaliation for attempting to share information about the death.\r\n6. CoreCivic facilities have previously been fined for negligence and contract violations that preceded deaths in ICE custody. See, e.g., https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24529304-stewart-contract-discrepancy-dec-2018.\r\n7. At least 55 deaths have occurred at CoreCivic's ICE facilities since 2003--more than any other ICE contractor.\r\n8. Since early 2017, ICE ceased affirmatively publishing detainee death reviews, forcing families to file FOIAs and sue when their loved ones die in order to obtain basic information on the government's findings.\r\n9. Congress recently approved the expansion of ICE detention by more than 20% -- up 7,500 beds to 41,500 funded.\r\n10. DHS and the present administration proposed cuts to inspection budgets for ICE detention centers, rendering the public less able to assess the lethality of ICE detention operations, including those at Otay Mesa.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Your request was received in this office on 4/3/2024. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 4/3/2024.  You have requested copy of the ICE Health Services Corps Mortality Review for Cristian Dumitrascu, who died at the CoreCivic Otay Mesa Detention Center on March 5, 2023. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAngela Flores \n\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist\n",

Your appeal, dated on 1/20/2025, was received on 2/7/2025. \n\nThe Government Information Law Division acknowledges your appeal request of and is assigning it number 2025-ICAP-00105 for tracking purposes.

My hope is that if there are any labor charges associated with the responsive documents, we can discuss them within this week extension, before sending out a deposit request, and allow you the opportunity to amend further if you would like.\r\n\r\nIf you could kindly respond to this email in agreeance to the one-week extension (making the new due date 9/20/24), I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nKelsey Curtis\r\nDepartment Analyst\r\nOffice of the Director\r\nRecords Resource Section\r\nMichigan State Police\r\n7150 Harris Drive\r\nDimondale, Michigan 48821\r\nTX: 517-643-7738\r\n\r\n\"A PROUD tradition of SERVICE through EXCELLENCE, INTEGRITY, and COURTESY\"\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB04EA.4A787BF0]<http://www.mi.gov/mspjobs>\n",

Unfortunately there it is not possible to give you an estimated completion date at this time, as the backlog remains significant.\r\n\r\nAll cases must go through two levels of review before a release determination is made.  As we have summarized in previous status checks, the NSA/CSS processes cases on a first-in, first-out basis, which is based on the original date of the request.  The NSA/CSS frequently receives referrals and consultations from other agencies that often pre-date the cases in our review queue.  Other agencies, with similar backlogs, may have a case for a year or more before determining that they need to consult or refer their case to the NSA.  When this happens, Department of Justice mandate requires this Agency to place a referral/consultation ahead of others.  Therefore our backlog queue has a tendency to fluctuate over time with regard to where each FOIA case stands.  This is also why it is difficult to provide an estimated response date as it could change.",

As stated in a previous email, dated 6 Sep. 2013, each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made. As of now, the responsive material in your case is with a first level reviewer.  Once that is complete, the case will move to the 2nd level review queue.  It's difficult to estimate the completion date, but a tentative rough estimate is 8-12 months before a final release decision will be made. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience.\r\nRegards,\r\nCindy B.\r\nNSA FOIA Office\r\n(301)688-6527",

As stated in a previous email, dated September 2014, each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made. As of now, the responsive material in your case is with a second level reviewer.  It's difficult to estimate the completion date, but a tentative rough estimate is 2  years before a final release decision will be made. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience.\nRegards,\r\nCindy B.\r\nNSA FOIA Office\r\n(301)688-6527",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent 56 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. No new or additional redactions have been made to this particular installment of records, and the responsive records appear just as they did when provided to the original requester. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email.

Accordingly, if we do not hear from you by February 7, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, you must click the link and either download the files or click on the files to open them, and you must notify us that you have accessed the files or that you are unable to access the records made available to you no later than February 7, 2022. Again, if you fail to respond to this notification by that date, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before February 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image004.png@01D803D0.B1CB20F0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a second installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional 36 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (the original requester was the parent of the student whose education record it was). An Exemption Log for this record is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, these records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below. As requested, this is a public link and is not password protected.\r\n\r\n[\u200bFolder icon] Public Records Request \u2013 MuckRock PRA Audit<https://epscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/09566_apps_everettsd_org/ErZyFIvyVTBNqV9mmDkx-sEBSOkFAxLiwaKniCabzzGOWw?e=9lNHuO>\r\n\r\nThe system will not notify us when you access your records. Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nWe have yet received a response from you verifying receipt of our last installment provided on January 7, 2022. We are providing an additional opportunity for you to respond to our notifications that an installment of records has been made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by March 14, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, as we have not heard from you since your original request was made and we have not received confirmation of your receipt of the January 7, 2022 installment, we have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation of receipt of both installments provided to date. Upon such confirmation, the anticipated date for the next installment of records will be provided. Otherwise, your request will be deemed abandoned without further action as noted above.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D81F49.72D49E00]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

This installment represents one of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district\u2019s response to that request. While this installment contains only one request, it was a large request that took many months to fulfill. Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted.

These records represent 1 public records request received in 2021 and 5 public records requests received in 2020, and the district responses to those requests. Please note that two of these requests were made by parents of students in the district, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s name and other identifying information have been redacted and replaced with initials to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. In addition, a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (request 20200930 1b LB). The original requester was the parent of the student whose education record was requested, and the requester later abandoned her request, so there are no records to provide for that request. An Exemption Log for the record withheld is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nThese records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below.

Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by August 28, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWe received no response to our email, and we had no confirmation that you claimed or reviewed your records by August 28, 2022.

These records installments were received on the following dates:\r\n\r\n01/07/2022\r\n02/11/2022\r\n03/21/2022\r\n04/22/2022\r\n05/27/2022\r\n07/28/2022\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA.

If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, your request is deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

Based on the language used in that email it is unclear if this was intended to be a clarification of the March 19, 2024, request or if it was intended to be a new request for records.\r\n\r\nAt this time, we consider this to be a new request for records, as the date range extends beyond the date of the previous March 19, 2024, request, and the link you have included for us to upload records is different than the link provided for the March 19, 2024, request. If you intended for your email clarify your March 19, 2024, request, or if you intended for this new request to replace the March 19, 2024, request, please let us know. Otherwise, we will move forward with both requests respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this request, you have asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 17, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 30, 2025.

While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for you to claim future installments of records and prevent further abandonments of your requests moving forward, whenever possible we will upload installments of records to you using the link you have provided for this request.\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Feverett-public-schools-district-29079%252Feverett-public-schools-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2010-2021-120970%252F%253Femail%253DPublicRecords%252540everettsd.org&url_auth_token=AAEh7OGhIjD3G3hthbXF_zOl4rI%3A1rne10%3AM10-zV4YF_dmLfUXiw4O8SOKj6lRHZzP8a9MqfnKtIo\r\n\r\nIf an alternate method to provide records is necessary, we will notify you that the records will be provided in another method, likely to be placed on a USB and mailed to the address provided:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have concluded processing this request and have the responsive records available for you. These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. If you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA86BB.0CDDA6B0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

We appreciate your communication with us.\r\n\r\nOur records indicate that delivery of the USB containing the responsive records for your request was delivered and received by MuckRock at 12:17 pm on April 8, 2024. Attached is a copy of the delivery confirmation email received by USPS.\r\n\r\nIn our April 4, 2024, communication we stated that we would accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records, and that upon that confirmation your request would be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. Accordingly, as your request stated that providing records on USB by mail to MuckRock was an acceptable method for delivery, and because all responsive records have been provided and confirmation of delivery of the records was received, your request was considered fulfilled and was closed on April 8, 2024. As the district does not have anything further to provide for this closed request, no further action is planned and the one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review began on April 8, 2024.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to locate the records previously provided, or if you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page:  https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA97E3.3798C4A0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on March 22, 2024. In that request, you asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nToday I am writing to let you know that we have an eighth installment of records available for you. These records include 24 public records requests received by the district between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, and the district\u2019s responses to those requests. Please note that we acknowledge your request to receive records in reverse chronological order, however, there is one public records request during this timeframe (December 13, 2022) that will be provided in the next installment of records, as it is a large request requiring extensive redaction of student and parent personal information and it is still being processed. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nThe responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail to the address provided in your request:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405530109355107600834<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tLabels=4200211545779405530109355107600834> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records. Anticipated delivery date is Saturday, March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe district has confirmed delivery of the previous installment provided, which the district accepts as your receipt of the installment provided, which was delivered in or at the mailbox at 3:44 pm on Monday, January 27, 2025. A copy of the delivery confirmation for that installment is attached for reference. If you did not receive the records provided, please let us know.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate providing the next installment of records on or before April 9, 2025.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB886E.29686850]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWendy L.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

When officers arrived, they attempted to reason with her, explaining that her father was not obligated to drive her. Despite multiple requests to exit the vehicle, Alexandria refused and was eventually removed from the car and placed under arrest. During the encounter, she made allegations against the officers and resisted arrest before being taken into custody.\r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who responded to this incident.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",

In addition, and as stated in Ms. Kochurka's email, any time frame and/or topic(s) you could provide would facilitate our records search and response to you.\r\n\r\nOnce we have received your response, we can initiate our records search.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have questions concerning this matter.\r\n\nDoug Hibbard\r\nFOIA Public Liaison",

Please be advised that OIP\u2019s FOIA Library post under the heading \u201cRecords of Communications Between the Office of Public Affairs and The News Media Organizations\u201d now has records dating to January 7, 2019. I am inquiring into your interest in narrowing the timeframe of your search to January 7, 2019 through March 2, 2019. I updated our search to that date range which located just over 1500 emails that are potentially responsive to your request. Additionally, I\u2019d like to suggest narrowing your request to emails with FOXNews employees as the current emails include list-serve type email blasts that were received by Public Affairs employees from the @foxnews.com domain. If you are still interested in this request and my suggested narrower scope, please respond to this email. If I have not heard from you after thirty business days, I will assume you are no longer interested in this matter and will close your request administratively.\r\n\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nEric Hotchkiss\r\nSenior Government Information Specialist\r\nDepartment of Justice\r\nOffice of Information Policy\r\nOffice: 202-616-5456",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

However after you let me know that you did not receive the most recent mailing(s?), I want to make sure you have it all. I\u2019m going to load/re-load onto your website all of the records including all of the ones previously mailed due to the website not working for me, and that emailing wasn\u2019t working for both of us consistently. While you haven\u2019t said for sure whether or not the three records uploaded last time to test are showing up for you, I can only assume they are, as they do show as loaded successfully for me. Below is an image of all the records loaded today.\r\n\r\nIf you find anything is missing, please let me know.\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB2C77.5B65A500]\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DB2C77.BC917020]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nCheryl Portier \u2013 Operations - 360-662-1616\r\n\r\nOur Vision-A vibrant and inclusive learning community where all students find their passion and achieve their dreams.\r\n\r\nOur Mission-Provide a high-quality Pre-K through 12th grade education to ensure all students graduate college and career ready.\r\nOur Core Values-Keeping our core values at the forefront helps us focus our priorities.",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nCopies of the following entries from Clandestine Services Historical Series\r\nCSHP 105: Record of Paramilitary Action Against the Castro Government of Cuba, March 1960\r\nCSHP 163: The Evolution of Ground Paramilitary Activities at the Staff Level, October 1949-September 1955\r\nCSHP 183: Paramilitary Activities at the Staff Level (possibly Paramilitary Activities at the Staff Level, 15 Sep 55 - 31 Dec 61, II, 374- 375 (Mar 70).).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. That the records will be informative of the government's historical activities is demonstrated by the fact that these are the Agency's own histories. Thus, the Agency has already deemed them historically significant.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEmma Best",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial.

You requested the following: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Email log of Principal Ortega of Hamline Elementary from 9am - 2pm on January 24, 2025. I am not looking for any emails sent to specific parents or students, please remove those entries from the email log. \r\n\r\n2. Phone call log of Principal Ortega and any front office staff at Hamline Elementary between 9am - 2pm on January 24, 2025. Specifically, include any calls to other CPS numbers and the Chicago Police Department. \r\n\r\nThis request is on behalf of The FOIA Bakery, an Illinois nonprofit. Because this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMiriam Bhimani \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchicago-public-schools-3121%252Fhamline-elementary-docs-181496%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAATZ164Jy60iQjs6iHTUOyYGcc%3A1tjs9t%3A9IHyeotsnY-fMZV9wWhrRYeyt44Y4N1qH1gm2vyoqdA \r\nRESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (personal email addresses, non-CPS phone numbers) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically,  section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records,  the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,  unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student and parent information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified,  maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school,  regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
