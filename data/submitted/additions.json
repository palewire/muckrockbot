Please include all transcripts, memoranda, and other communications in your search. Please limit your search to the following keywords: \u201cCrooks\u201d \u201cassassination\u201d \u201cshooter\u201d \u201crally\u201d \u201cTrump.\u201d Responsive records would include all relevant internal memoranda, plans, reports, and email correspondence sent to and from the agency\u2019s top five senior-most officials related to, mentioning or generated as a result of the assassination attempt. \r\n2. All relevant internal memoranda, plans, reports, and email correspondence sent to and from the members of your agency and members of the following organizations: Butler Township Police Department, Butler Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Pennsylvania State Police, Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center, Delaware Valley Intelligence Center (Philadelphia, PA), and Western Pennsylvania All Hazards Fusion Center (Pittsburgh, PA) containing the following keywords: \u201cCrooks\u201d \u201cassassination\u201d \u201cshooter\u201d \u201crally\u201d \u201cear\u201d \u201cTrump.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest.\r\nThe release of the information is for non-commercial purposes. I am a researcher for Insider, a news organization based in New York City, whose mission is journalism in the public interest. This request is for news gathering purposes. I, or my colleagues at Business Insider, will use the records to inform the public through our reporting. I therefore request a waiver of all fees and charges pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act. If you claim such an exemption to my request under the Freedom of Information Act, please cite in writing the specific statutory exemption. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format (such as excel file (.xlsx) or other database form, or as .pdfs) and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHannah Beckler",
