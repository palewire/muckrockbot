I'm interested in documenting how agencies respond and shift around for major incidents and this looks like an excellent example of MABAS activation and cooperation. \r\n\r\nCould you please provide the after action report, a list of all agencies and equipment that responded to the fire including dispatch, arrival and release times. If possible I'd also like copies of the dispatch transcripts or audio. I understand you may not be able to provide the audio or transcripts but in lieu of a response could you provide the FOIA information for the dispatch center used by your agency so I can directly request information from them?\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
