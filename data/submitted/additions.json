        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll Bureau records mentioning or pertaining to Tengiz Kitovani (Georgian: \u10d7\u10d4\u10dc\u10d2\u10d8\u10d6 \u10d9\u10d8\u10e2\u10dd\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8). Kitovani was born on the 9th of June 1938 in the then Soviet city of Tbilisi and died on the 13th of November 2023. The death of Kitovani was widely reported and a copy of a Radio Free Europe report about his death is attached. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Tengiz Kitovani from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices,  legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Tengiz Kitovani. Please conduct a search for records related to Tengiz Kitovani and the 1991\u20131992 Georgian coup d'\u00e9tat. \r\n\r\nFollowing the civil war, Kitovani was in Moscow and then returned to Georgian in 2014. His presence was not welcomed, and he likely generated discussion by the bureau. Please also search for any written correspondence between Kiotvani and any member of bureau leadership. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Tengiz Kitovani. \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
