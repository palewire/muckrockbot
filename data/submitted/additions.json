A document showing how many Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) customers are signed up for auto payment and currently have delinquencies. If possible, it would be good to have these numbers broken up by the number of customers who are one month in arrears, two months in arrears, three months in arrears, four months in arrears, five months in arrears, six months in arrears, seven months in arrears, eight months in arrears, nine months in arrears, 10 months in arrears, 11 months in arrears, and 12 months in arrears. If it's not possible, or would be overly difficult to break down the document in this way, then please ignore that aspect of this request but still denote how many DWSD customers are signed up for autopayment and have delinquencies.\r\n\r\n2. The same document as requested above, or a different document, showing the number of DWSD customers who had delinquencies as a result of a technical issue while being signed up for autopay. Please pull this information for Nov. 1 2023-Nov. 2024 OR this fiscal year OR the most recent 12 month period available, which ever is most readily available.\r\n\r\n3. A document showing how many DWSD customers have had accounts with a cash-only status. Please pull this information for Nov. 1 2023-Nov. 2024 OR this fiscal year OR the most recent 12 month period available, which ever is most readily available.\r\n\r\nThis information will not be used for commercial purposes and is intended to be released to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLaura Herberg",
