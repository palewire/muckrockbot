All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The five most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee concerning immigration matters. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Including final ticket sales and event costs, if available.\r\nCSU has conducted a reasonable search for these records under California Government Code \u00a77922.535 and has determined that your request, either in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records.  CSU will make available to you any that are public.\r\n\r\nRecords subject to the following exemptions will be withheld or redacted as appropriate:  Deliberative Process. Records that reflect the deliberative, decision-making process of the CSU, which often involves multiple individuals, who need to converse about issues candidly. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a77922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Train (D.DC 1982) 491 F.2d 63; Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App.4th 469.\r\n\r\nWe will let you know when we have gathered all the records.  It will be necessary to redact from them any personal and otherwise privileged information before they can be made available to you.  CSU estimates the records will be available January 24, 2026.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to inspect the records at CSULB, you may contact me to schedule a mutually convenient date and time.  If you wish to receive copies instead, CSU may charge the direct cost of duplication (20 cents per page).  Once the records are located, we will advise you as to the exact number of pages upon which any charge will be based.  We will require full payment before we begin the redaction and duplication process. The decision that records are exempt and will not be disclosed was made by the Records Access Officer at CSULB, Jamarr Johnson.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJamarr Johnson, CCSA\r\nDirector of Audit, Public Records & Special Projects\r\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\r\n1250 Bellflower Blvd, BH 320\r\nLong Beach, CA 90840\r\n(562) 985-6033\r\n[csuLB-long]",

CSU will make available to you any that are public.  Records subject to the following exemptions will be withheld or redacted as appropriate:\r\n\r\nRecords that reflect the deliberative, decision-making process of the CSU, which often involves multiple individuals, who need to converse about issues candidly. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a77922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Train (D.DC 1982) 491 F.2d 63; Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App.4th 469.\r\n\r\nWe will let you know when we have gathered all the records.  It will be necessary to redact from them any personal and otherwise privileged information before they can be made available to you.  CSU estimates the records will be available by July 25, 2025.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to inspect the records at CSULB, you may contact me to schedule a mutually convenient date and time.  If you wish to receive copies instead, CSU may charge the direct cost of duplication (20 cents per page).  Once the records are located, we will advise you as to the exact number of pages upon which any charge will be based.\u202f We will require full payment before we begin the redaction and duplication process.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJamarr Johnson, CCSA\r\nDirector of Audit, Public Records & Special Projects\r\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\r\n1250 Bellflower Blvd, BH 320\r\nLong Beach, CA 90840\r\n(562) 985-6033\r\n[csuLB-long]",

All data on which ICE based the following language included in today's detainee death notification for Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani (https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/criminal-illegal-alien-pakistan-passes-away-suspected-natural-causes-fort-worth): \r\n\"ICE\u2019s in-custody deaths this past year average less than 1%--this is the lowest in ICE history.\"\r\n2. Any communications between ICE and DHS Press officers substantiating these two objective factual statements. \r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and make the following statements in support of this request under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination. See www.muckrack.com/Andrew-Free\r\n2. ICE's statement that the average of in-custody deaths the past year \"is the lowest in ICE history\" contains no identifiable, objective statistical basis in fact. \r\n3. There is an urgent need to inform the public if ICE is misleading policymakers and the world in press releases about deaths in ICE custody. \r\n4. ICE is under a legal obligation not to publish false or misleading information about objectively verifiable facts. \r\n5. Receiving the requested records will aid the public in either substantiating or falsifying the agency's claim about death in custody \"average\" being \"the lowest in ICE history.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Your request was received in this office on 12/11/2025. Specifically, you requested records pertaining to Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public greater than the public\u2019s general interest in Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2026-ICFO-08352.

The list is attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Because the production of documents for this installment is below the threshold for which we assess a fee for the reproduction or delivery of records, we provide this installment to you free of charge. \r\nAfter reviewing your request, we determined that clarification is necessary before we can move forward. It is unclear from your request what specific records you are attempting to obtain. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.520, we require clarification of your statement \" along with accompanying impeachment material\". Please clarify what specific records you are trying to obtain so that we may be able to locate responsive documents, if any. \r\n\r\nUntil we receive clarification, we cannot act further upon your request. \r\nIf we do not receive your clarification on or before February 16, 2026, we will consider this request to be abandoned.

In our view, this period will begin to run on February 17, 2026 unless sufficient clarification is received. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to receiving clarification on your public records request. \r\nFinally, please be advised that there may be fees associated with the reproduction or delivery of public records.

Please find the responsive records attached to this email. Installment 1 is the Potential Impeachment Disclosure list as well as the first set of records that have been reviewed for release. \r\n\r\nPlease note that there are redactions (black boxes) on various pages of the responsive documents. Redactions may be small or large, depending on the size of the redaction. There may be multiple redactions on a page. Within a redaction is a white code, which will look something like [1a]. The code printed within the redaction designates the exemption on the attached Spokane County Exemption Log. The log identifies the statutes for the corresponding redaction codes and explains why they apply to the specific portion of the record being withheld. \r\nBecause the production of documents for this installment is below the threshold for which we assess a fee for the reproduction or delivery of records, we provide this installment to you free of charge. \r\n\r\nStaff will require additional time to complete the search, review all compiled records for exempt information, and redact records if necessary.

I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The list is attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Paul St Surin\r\n2. Kristopher Bielecki\r\n3. Jairo Palacios\r\n4. Tony Tiburzi\r\n5. Troy Horton-Jones\r\n6. David Weldon\r\n7. Mamadou Bah\r\n8. Nevin Nolte\r\n9. Matthew Banocy\r\n10. Morgan Banocy\r\n11. Zachary Ruhling\r\n12. Walter Holleman\r\n13. Cole Hofmann\r\n14. William Healey\r\n15. Tyler Coss Y Leon\r\n\r\n- Complete investigative files for each complaint, including but not limited to reports of recorded statements, video surveillance or body camera footage, investigative files, witness interviews, and photographs.\r\n- The investigative findings of each complaint.\r\n- Any correspondence from the Civilian Review Board, Police Accountability Board, Administrative Charging Committee or other civilian police oversight board.\r\n- The final disposition of each case, if any.\r\n\r\n****As with previous requests of this nature,  we will accept disciplinary history summaries -- to include ALL closed and pending complaints -- for all of the officers listed for the time being.****\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Public Information Act requires that the requested information be forwarded within ten (10) days. Pursuant to General Provisions \u00a7 4-203(b)(2), if it will take more than 10 working days to produce the requested records, we must be notified, in writing or by email, of that fact. If the records are not able to be produced within 10 days, you may request an extension up to thirty (30) days.  If access to any or all records described above is denied, please identify in a written statement the general content of each item being withheld. Additionally, \u00a7 4-203 (a) and (c) of the General Provisions Article requires you to provide in writing grounds for denial, citing legal authority under which you may deny access.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.  Alternatively, please consider waiving any fees, pursuant to \u00a7 4-206(e)(2)(ii) of the General Provisions Article, as this request is on behalf of individuals served by the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, a state government agency, which solely serves indigent citizens of Maryland.  As a result, my request for the above-listed public records is in the public interest.  I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDeborah Levi\r\nDirector of Special Litigation\r\nMaryland Office of the Public Defender\r\n(443) 272-1068",
