Submit to the University President a written appeal that specifically\r\nstates the word \u201cappeal\u201d and identifies the reason(s) for the denial to be\r\nreversed. You may email your appeal to: president@emich.edu; or you may\r\nmail it to Eastern Michigan University   ATTN: President ~ 202 Welch\r\nHall ~ Ypsilanti,\r\nMI 48197.\r\n\r\n2.  Commence an action in the court of claims to compel the University\u2019s\r\ndisclosure of the public records within 180 days after the final\r\ndetermination to deny the request.  If you prevail, you may be awarded\r\ncosts and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. MCL15.240 Sec. 10(7) states: \"If the\r\ncourt determines in an action commenced under this section that the public\r\nbody has arbitrarily and capriciously violated this act by refusal or delay\r\nin disclosing or providing copies of a public record, the court shall order\r\nthe public body to pay a civil fine of $1,000.00, which shall be deposited\r\ninto the general fund of the state treasury.

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with the RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file a RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Cmmw. 2012). As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a Right-to-Know\u00a0Request pursuant to the RTKL and will process it as an informal request.  You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request. Please note that if you resubmit your request as a written request pursuant to the RTKL, the City will deem your informal request to have been withdrawn.\u00a0  The City\u2019s Open Records Policy can be found here:\u00a0  https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/   The statewide form appears at the end of the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. If you require a hard copy of the form and/or policy, please let me know and one will be provided.

The Stewart Detention Center has the highest number of deaths in ICE custody of any facility in the ICE detention since FY17. \r\n2. Stewart is currently one of the most populated sites of detention in the ICE system. \r\n3. Calls to 911 in 2025 from Stewart have exceeded their numbers for any period over the past five years. \r\n4. Audio recordings of Stewart 911 calls reflect instances in which EMS units were unavailable to treat significant illnesses or injuries as a result of previous calls from the facility.\r\n5. Lack of access to timely emergency medical care threatens the health safety of people in Stewart and the surrounding community. \r\n6. ICE Mortality Reviewers have attributed lack of timely access to emergency medical care to a significant number of deaths in ICE custody. \r\n7. The records requested will shed light on whether, and to what extent, ICE is aware of the challenges posed and consequences created by its use of detention in high numbers at the Stewart facility. \r\n8. DHS-OIG, ICE OPR, IHSC, ICE ODO, Congress, and the General Accountability Office have all previously cited CoreCivic, ICE's Atlanta Field Office, and Stewart for violations of ICE's standards and contracts. \r\n9. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination through edited publications, and have previously been granted expedited processing by federal FOIA offices on this basis. \r\n10.

Your request was received in this office on 8/27/2025. Specifically, you requested records pertaining to ll Significant Event Notifications and Significant Incident Reports received by the IHSC Field Medical Coordinator or OAQ Contracting Officer pertaining to medical emergencies or 911 calls at the Stewart Detention Center for the period beginning January 1, 2024, and continuing through August 26, 2025. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

You have requested records pertaining to Significant Event Notifications and Significant Incident Reports received by the IHSC Field Medical Coordinator or OAQ Contracting Officer pertaining to medical emergencies or 911 calls at the Stewart Detention Center for the period beginning January 1, 2024, and continuing through August 26, 2025. \r\n\r\nICE has considered your request under both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  Information about an individual that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records may be accessed by that individual unless the agency has exempted the system of records from the access provisions of the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nICE has conducted a search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request and no records responsive to your request were found. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within the above mentioned ICE office(s).  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of the original response letter, within 90 days of the date of the letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.  You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 and refer to your tracking number. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

Specifically, I seek documentation regarding the recent directive that instructs officers and command staff to conduct traffic enforcement exclusively on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the processing of this request, please provide:\r\n\r\n1. Any memos, emails, or internal communications from agency leadership discussing or promoting the strategy to issue tickets solely on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\n2. Statistical data or reports that outline traffic enforcement activities, including the number of tickets issued on Wednesdays compared to other days of the week.\r\n\r\n3. Any relevant guidelines or policies that mandate or suggest certain days for traffic enforcement over others.\r\n\r\n4. Information on the objectives behind this strategy and whether any analysis was conducted before its implementation.\r\n\r\nI propose a fee waiver for this request based on the public interest in transparency around law enforcement practices. This information is crucial for understanding how these policies may impact public safety and the fair application of traffic laws.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTransparentPolicing2026",

The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",

A copy of that report is available here: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-07/OIG-22-47-July22.pdf. \r\n\r\nLikely Custodians: \r\nThe following DHS-OIG Custodians are believed to have responsive documents and should be tasked: \r\nJames Cuffari, Ph.D., John D. Shiffer, Chief Inspector; Stephanie Christian, Supervisory Lead Inspector Ian Stumpf, Senior Inspector; Erika Algeo, Inspector; Brett Cheney, Inspector; Lisa Knight, Communications Analyst; Lorraine Eide, Independent Referencer.\r\n\r\nProposed Temporal Period: \r\nThe following time period should be searched: \r\nOctober 1, 2021 - Present (i.e., the date on which DHS-OIG FOIA tasks an adequate search for responsive records). \r\nWe are willing to negotiate a narrower temporal period upon a representation from DHS-OIG that responsive records are unlikely to exist in all or part of the temporal scope we have requested. \r\n\r\nLikely Systems of Records: \r\nDHS-OIG should query any email systems the Likely Custodians use, as well as the government-issued phones these custodians use. \r\nDHS-OIG should query any SharePoint or similar drive containing records regarding the Folkston Inspection conducted in November 2021. \r\nDHS-OIG should query the JICMS for any responsive records as described above. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request (pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)\r\nOn behalf of the Al Otro Lado #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, we respectfully request expedited processing. \r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(i) - Harm to individuals from delayed production. DHS-OIG concluded in its publicly available report.  \r\n\r\n\u201cFolkston did not meet standards for facility conditions, medical care, grievances, segregation, staff-detainee communications, and handling of detainee property. We identified violations that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees. Folkston facilities were unsanitary and dilapidated, with torn mattresses, water leaks and standing water, mold growth and water damage, rundown showers, mold and debris in the ventilation system, insect infestations, lack of access to hot showers, inoperable toilets, an inoperable thermometer display on a kitchen freezer, and an absence of hot meals. Facility medical staff did not provide timely access to specialty care or adequate mental health care for detainees. Folkston did not provide timely or complete responses to detainee grievances and requests. Folkston also did not consistently provide required services to detainees in segregation and inappropriately handcuffed detainees. Further, ICE did not consistently respond to detainee requests in a timely manner and did not provide detainees with paper grievance forms and submission boxes as required. ICE also did not provide detainees sufficient contact with deportation officers. Lastly, the facility has improperly handled detainee property. In addition, Folkston has not met staffing levels required by the contract with ICE to ensure proper detainee oversight. In addressing COVID-19, Folkston did not consistently enforce use of masks and social distancing. In April 2021, Folkston began providing COVID-19 vaccinations to detainees.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2022, ICE responded to OIG\u2019s 13 recommendations, purportedly providing \u201ccorroboration\u201d that Folkston had been brought into compliance. ICE followed up on June 13, 2022, seeking OIG close its recommendations. OIG treated 12 of 13 recommendations as satisfied and closed them. However, it is unclear how or why OIG concluded it could rely upon the representations of ICE regarding how it had addressed each recommendation, such that the people locked inside Folkston experience a material change in their daily conditions. In several instances, ICE disputed OIG\u2019s findings, even while indicating it would \u201cconcur\u201d with the recommendations that it make changes to implement standards compliance. (See pages 39-42 of Report No. 22-47.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iii) \u2014 Loss of Substantial Due Process Rights to people inside Folkston from delayed production.\r\n\r\nEven after ICE represented to DHS-OIG that it had corrected many the violations it admits OIG documented during the unannounced inspection, detained people inside Folkston reported to DHS many of the very same violations OIG described. According to multiple detained individuals, these conditions unabated.\r\nSee, e.g., https://www.albanyherald.com/news/protests-at-ice-detention-center-mount-as-expansion-plans-move-forward/article_6c8cf39c-c25c-11ec-be63-8bbf37990359.html. \r\n\r\nAn active hunger strike remains ongoing at Folkston to protest these conditions. \r\n\r\nIn the past, ICE officials have attempted to deny the very conditions OIG found in its unannounced inspections during the agency\u2019s communications with House Appropriations Homeland Chair Lucille Roybal-Allard, according to FOIA records obtained from ICE: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6705734-ICE-Emails-Pertaining-to-Congressional-Inquiries.html. \r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv) \u2014 A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\r\n\r\nThe future of ICE detention in Georgia and ICE\u2019s use of private immigration detention contractors like The GEO Group is a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest on  which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence, and these records requests are directly responsive to this media interest. Accordingly, Expedited Processing is warranted under Section 5.5(e)(1)(iv). \r\n\r\nPresident Joe Biden told organizers at a Georgia car rally who interrupted his event to demand he keep his promise to close private prisons and immigration detention centers, \u201cGive me Five Days, Man.\u201d https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-give-me-five-days-hecklers-calling-closure-detention-centers-1587639. As the video makes clear, the President of the United States was referring to privately operated immigration detention centers, as well as private prisons. See also: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-georgia-rally-speech-protest-b1839959.html; https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/04/30/biden_to_protesters_give_me_another_five_days_to_fix_immigration.html; https://nypost.com/2021/04/29/biden-heckled-by-abolish-ice-protesters-teases-action-in-5-days/. \r\n\r\nInstead of ending private prisons in Georgia May 2021, President Biden ordered the termination of ICE\u2019s contract with the Irwin County Detention Center. By December 2021, however, it became clear that far from fulfilling his stated promise, the Biden Administration would actually expand its use of private immigration detention in Georgia: https://www.advancingjustice-atlanta.org/news/closefolkston. https://creativeloafing.com/content-500557-news-brief-private-prison-undergoing-expansion-while-under. \r\n\r\nThen, in February 2022, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported exclusively that the Biden Administration planned an unprecedented expansion of Folkston that would make it the largest ICE facility east of the Mississippi. https://www.ajc.com/news/exclusive-south-georgia-immigration-detention-complex-aims-to-expand/QN5G2BFOPREQHEBDOPPAX2PSVI/. \r\n\r\nIn apparent violation of the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations and Federal Acquisition regulations, this historic expansion would occur through a no-bid, single-vendor contract expansion. The beneficiary: The GEO Group. People supporting those locked inside Folkston protested: https://www.splcenter.org/presscenter/splc-planned-expansion-private-ice-detention-center-georgia-betrayal-biden. \r\n\r\nA people\u2019s movement seeking depopulation of the Folkston facility by ICE and cancellation of the Folkston Contract has been active since 2022. http://www.charltoncountyherald.com/news/second-rally-held-at-the-folkston-ice-processing-center/article_7254cb22-bfe3-11ec-8548-978ce9320949.html.  \r\n\r\nThe timing of DHS-OIG and ICE\u2019s responses to the findings of the November 2021 unannounced inspection raise significant questions about the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s planned expansion of Folkston. At the exact time OIG was informing ICE Folkston was serially non-compliant (OIG No. 22-47 contains perhaps more documented violations of ICE standards than any other DHS-OIG inspection of an ICE facility in history), ICE was planning to reward the contract with an additional expansion. At the exact same time OIG was informing ICE that its contractors had failed to follow through on the financial penalties against GEO that would have followed from the 2019 and 2020 contract discrepancy reports ICE issued, ICE was planning to further reward the non compliant contractor with a no-bid, multi year, multimillion dollar expansion. \r\n\r\nWhy did OIG wait and negotiate with ICE, given the violations it documented, rather than issuing a Management Alert, as it did in Torrance, NM? \r\n\r\nWhat \u201ccorroboration\u201d did ICE provide OIG? \r\n\r\nWhy, given the serial failures of ICE to accurately document the violations OIG found on unannounced inspection, did OIG take ICE at its word and not conduct a second unannounced inspection before closing out its recommendations? \r\n\r\nWhy do people inside Folkston still report the same violations OIG documented if OIG has concluded ICE remedied the violations? \r\n\r\nThe records requested carry the potential to answer these questions and more. The answers are required now \u2014 BEFORE ICE signs a multimillion dollar expansion of a facility that less than 8 months ago failed an unannounced inspection. Failure to grant expedited processing will deprive the public, people inside and those working with Congress and the agency of the public records necessary to corroborate or disprove the current allegations that Folkston is not fit for human occupancy, and is incapable of reform. \r\n\r\nFinally, it appears that despite knowing of OIG\u2019s findings, executives from The GEO Group made affirmative statements during shareholder calls and in public SEC filings that are contradicted by ICE\u2019s concurrence with those findings. Because GEO\u2019s market capitalization of $1.9bn is based nearly exclusively on its ability to obtain and maintain contracts with government partners \u2014 including the ~25-35% of its revenue ICE payments represent \u2014 the investing public has an urgent need to know whether GEO\u2019s executives misled shareholders and the SEC regarding the services the company renders at Folkston, and its relationship with ICE as a contracting partner. \r\n\r\nI certify that the above statements are true and correct pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nRequestor: \r\nAl Otro Lado and its #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We have received your public records act request.  Of note, the attachment states a date of October 30, but it was sent to us via Muckrock on November 19.\r\n\r\nThe request as stated is overbroad and unduly burdensome.  A search of all District Attorney email communications for the words \"prostitution,\" \"sex trafficking\" and \"human trafficking\" for an 11 year period would result in an unreasonably large volume of communication on every case touching upon these issues, as well as every training or discussion on these topics across a large office.  Much of that material would be exempt from disclosure under the CPRA, but working through each document to determine which were not exempt would take years, and is impracticable.\r\n\r\nI would like to help identify the specific documents that are of use to you, so that we can make a targeted search.  Let me know if it would help to discuss over the phone.\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC5AC5.61298380]\r\nHilary Kerrigan | Deputy County Counsel\r\nOffice of the County Counsel, County of Santa Clara\r\n70 West Hedding, East Wing, 9th Floor | San Jos\u00e9, CA 95110\r\nOffice: (408) 299-5925  Mobile: (626) 319-0136\r\nHilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org<mailto:Hilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org> | counsel.sccgov.org<https://counsel.sccgov.org/>\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: The information in this email is confidential and may be protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Doogan,\r\n\r\nThank you for speaking to me on the phone just now.  I understand that your main interest is in learning about the specific cases prosecuted in our County related to the topics you identified.  As I mentioned over the phone, we do not release protected personal identifying information under the California Constitution, nor do we release protected criminal history information or identities of victims under the Penal Code.  If you are interested in deidentified or aggregate data, please let me know the details and I can determine whether such data exists, or alternatively whether it can be extracted via computer programming for a fee.  You can also review the District Attorney's data dashboard here:  Santa Clara County DA Dashboard<https://data.dacalifornia.org/santa-clara>\r\nThe DA's website has reports, data, and policies on various topics here:  Publications and policies | Office of the District Attorney | County of Santa Clara<https://da.santaclaracounty.gov/publications/publications-and-policies>\r\n\r\nAs I explained to you, we do not have a method to run a key word search for documents across the District Attorney's Office generally and I will need you to describe what you are looking for before I am able to search for and identify potentially responsive public records.  You were unable to articulate a focused request over the phone, though I spent many minutes describing to you the various categories of available records, and attempting to redirect you from your insistence on a broad keyword search.  To the degree a keyword search is your primary objective, you can search the County ordinance code here: Code of Ordinances | Santa Clara County, CA | Municode Library<https://library.municode.com/ca/santa_clara_county/codes/code_of_ordinances>, you can review the Board of Supervisors policy manual here:  Board of Supervisors Policy Manual | Office of the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors | County of Santa Clara<https://cob.santaclaracounty.gov/governing-documents/board-supervisors-policy-manual>, and you can search meetings, agendas, and related materials for the Board of Supervisors here:  Board of Supervisors Policy Manual | Office of the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors | County of Santa Clara<https://cob.santaclaracounty.gov/governing-documents/board-supervisors-policy-manual>  The search term \"human trafficking\" on the last of these resources garnered 3,501 results when I searched just now, so there should be ample material for your preliminary review there.\r\n\r\nPlease reach out if you formulate a more focused request upon review the above.  In the meantime, we consider this request to be closed.\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC5AFB.3E5B6360]\r\nHilary Kerrigan | Deputy County Counsel\r\nOffice of the County Counsel, County of Santa Clara\r\n70 West Hedding, East Wing, 9th Floor | San Jos\u00e9, CA 95110\r\nOffice: (408) 299-5925  Mobile: (626) 319-0136\r\nHilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org<mailto:Hilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org> | counsel.sccgov.org<https://counsel.sccgov.org/>\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: The information in this email is confidential and may be protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

Any materials or programming (including handouts, slideshows, videos, textbooks, or other media) used in connection with providing training or guidance to law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the following subjects: (a) The First Amendment; (b) protests or demonstrations; (c) freedom of speech or expression; (d) filming police officers. This request is limited to materials used in trainings since January 1, 2020; \r\n2. Any policy concerning whether trainings on the topics mentioned in (1) are mandatory, or regulating the frequency of such trainings; and \r\n3. A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in.  Your request was received in this office on 8/25/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-56528.

You have requested records pertaining to: 1. Any materials or programming (including handouts, slideshows, videos, textbooks, or other media) used in connection with providing training or guidance to law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the following subjects: (a) The First Amendment; (b) protests or demonstrations; (c) freedom of speech or expression; (d) filming police officers. This request is limited to materials used in trainings since January 1, 2020; \r\n2. Any policy concerning whether trainings on the topics mentioned in (1) are mandatory, or regulating the frequency of such trainings; and \r\n3. A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request produced 5 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 5 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.

I\u2019d like to clarify that in my previous correspondence, I indicated we would provide an update by November 14, not a completed response. Given the size and complexity of your request, as well as the Division\u2019s current workload, we will require additional time to complete our review and compilation of responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we are providing a list that we believe is responsive to Parts 1 and 2 of your request. This list includes: (a) water rights or applications for water rights submitted by Vidler Water Company, Dorothy Timian-Palmer, and D.R. Horton (the \u201cnamed entities\u201d); and (b) water rights for which we have a record of purchase, sale, or transfer involving one or more of these entities.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this list does not distinguish between Part 1 and Part 2 of your request; the information is combined. If you would prefer that the information be separated by request item, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate.\r\n\r\nWe are not providing copies of applications or permits at this time, as those documents are publicly accessible through the Division\u2019s online permit search tool, available here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/PermitSearch.aspx\r\n\r\nIf you are seeking more than just the application or permit (e.g., the entire permit file), please let us know. If a permit file is already in electronic format, we can provide it pursuant to NRS 239.010(4). If it is not available electronically, you may inspect the file in person at our office. Please note that providing full copies of permit files will require additional time.\r\n\r\nWe also have several clarifying questions regarding the remainder of your request (Parts 3\u20139):\r\n\r\n  *   Part 3: You request \u201ca copy of all wells owned.\u201d The Division does not track well ownership directly, but rather manages water rights, which include points of diversion such as wells. If you are seeking information about points of diversion, those can be viewed in the applications and permits available through the online database linked above.\r\n  *   Part 4: This request includes several components:\r\n     *   (a) The Division does not issue a document formally titled as \u201cwell drilling permit.\u201d Instead, we process Notices of Intent (NOIs) to drill wells and receive well logs after drilling. If you are seeking well logs associated with wells held by the named entities, you may search by owner using our well log database here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/WellLogQuery.aspx. Please let us know if you have any questions, need assistance, or if this does not satisfy this portion of your request.\r\n     *   (b) Regarding \u201cwell monitoring reports,\u201d we issue monitoring waivers for the drilling of/conversion to monitoring wells and receive some depth-to-water measurements for those wells. We also receive pumpage reports for certain wells. Could you please clarify whether you are requesting submitted pumpage reports, depth-to-water data, or both? If you are seeking water level data, you may find it through our water level database here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/WaterLevelData.aspx\r\n     *   (c) The phrase \u201cmaterials referenced in applications\u201d is quite broad. Could you please specify what types of materials you are seeking?\r\n  *   Part 7: You request \u201ca copy of all protests\u201d filed against the named entities. The permit search database referenced above also includes a tab labeled \u201cAbrogations/Protests/Rulings\u201d that can be used to view protest information, if an application was protested. This can be used in combination with the list we\u2019ve provided in response to Parts 1 and 2.\r\n  *   Part 9: You request \u201ca copy of all petitions for review of canceled permits.\u201d Could you confirm whether this request is limited to petitions involving Vidler Water Company, Dorothy Timian-Palmer, and D.R. Horton?\r\n\r\nOnce we receive clarification on the above items, we will be able to provide an updated timeline for processing the remainder of your request. In the meantime, we will continue working on it to the best of our ability.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to fulfill this request. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with clarifications or preferences regarding the format or scope of the records you are seeking.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC5553.1B210E70]<http://water.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nJames Henson, Esq.\r\nChief Administrative Law Judge | Hearings Section\r\nNevada Division of Water Resources\r\nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources\r\n901 S.

Please note that these logs have been REDACTED to remove non-responsive portions (e.g., calls unrelated to the named entities).\r\n\r\nPART 6 \u2013 Proof of Beneficial Use Applications (2020\u20132025)\r\n\r\nWe located two certificated water rights responsive to this request. These are Permit 80648, Certificate 19594, and Permit 80649, Certificate 19595.\r\n\r\nThese records do not appear to exist in an electronic format and are not required to be created in such a format pursuant to NRS 239.010(4). However, you may visit our Carson City office, where the front desk will make the records available for your inspection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may search our Permits Database by owner name. Under the Maps and Due Dates tab, you can identify any additional permits that may have been certificated by the named entities. Here is a link to the Permits Database: Permit Search<http://ndwrintranet/permitsearch>.\r\n\r\nPART 8 \u2013 Public Comments or Complaints Regarding Named Entities\r\n\r\nWe conducted an electronic search of our database for instances of the three named entities within 10 words of the terms \u201ccomment\u201d or \u201ccomplaint.\u201d This search returned zero matches.\r\n\r\nIf you believe a specific hearing included a comment or complaint concerning one of the named entities, please let us know. That information may help us focus the request further. However, based on our current search, we have not located any responsive records.\r\n\r\nBecause we did not receive clarification on the remaining portions of your request (Parts 3, 4, 7, and 9), we consider this response COMPLETE and the matter CLOSED.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to submit a new request with additional details.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC8F8F.A4AD5330]<http://water.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nJames Henson, Esq.\r\nChief Administrative Law Judge | Hearings Section\r\nNevada Division of Water Resources\r\nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources\r\n901 S.
