The disclosure of information that I am seeking is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of operations and activities of the government and I have no commercial interest in the requested material. As the EPA develops new environmental regulations and emission standards, it is critical that there be transparency around EPA meetings and communications, especially as these meetings and communications may include non-governmental interested parties.\r\n\r\nThe request concerns the operations or activities of the government. The topic of the request concerns calendars that point to the activities of the government, including activities related to creating policy and passing regulations that impact the health and safety of the public. Furthermore, the requested materials will shed light on the activities of the EPA during a time when a relatively new administration is taking on ambitious environmental regulations.\r\n\r\nDisclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities. The information requested includes calendars of EPA officials during a period in which the EPA is working to develop and set new environmental regulations and emissions standards. Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the EPA\u2019s operations because the information requested will shed light on who EPA officials are meeting with, including government and non-government officials, and in turn, help the public understand what topics and stakeholders the EPA is considering during this time. With this information, the public will be better able to provide comment and otherwise participate in the regulatory process.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of requested information will likely result in public understanding. The information will help the public better understand the EPA's activities and operations as it develops new environmental rules and regulations. Documented is seeking this information because it is of interest to a large portion of the public, including the many concerned citizens that regularly acquire this type of information through our extensive range of publications. These publications include websites, blogs, newsletters, reports, press statements, social media networks such as Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Documented\u2019s work reaches a broad audience by being featured in television, radio, print and online news articles and interviews, including Bloomberg, the Guardian, the Huffington Post among others.\r\n\r\nDocumented plans to compile the information from this request into a distinct, original work that will be released to the public through the manner described above. Moreover, Documented has the expertise and experience to disseminate the information received and ensure that disclosure of records will contribute to public understanding of operations at EPA.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of requested information will contribute significantly to public understanding. Information contained in material disclosed as a result of this request will contribute significantly to public understanding. Disclosure of information requested will provide new information to the public regarding agency operations during a time when a new administration has set ambitious climate goals and policy. This request is being sent during a time when there is immense urgency to address climate change and therefore, it is important that the public have a clear understanding of the EPA\u2019 activities and operations.\r\n\r\nAs public momentum around addressing the climate crisis continues to grow, it is critical that the public have access to information that will allow them to better understand the main government agency tasked with setting environmental regulatory policy. Greater transparency around who EPA officials are speaking and meeting with during this time will enable the public to understand whose interests are being considered and whose voices the EPA is listening to. For this reason, disclosure of the requested information will have significant impact on public understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requester has no commercial interest in the disclosure and therefore public interest in disclosure is greater than the commercial interest in the request. Documented does not have a commercial interest in the request. Documented seeks to inform the public about government activities and to serve the public interest by sharing materials disclosed through this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nColette Rosenberg",
