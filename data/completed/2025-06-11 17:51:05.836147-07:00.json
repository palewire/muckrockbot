Please avoid providing data in PDF or paper printouts.\r\n\r\nThis request is made to support academic research conducted in the public interest and is not for commercial purposes. The data will contribute to a research project assessing the effect of music concerts on crime, aiming to enhance public understanding of how large events influence community safety.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25061.

Specifically, you have requested all records pertaining to A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Serawit Gezahegn Dejene, (DOB: 3/29/79; COC: Ethiopia) who died January 29, 2025, following his detention at the Eloy Detention Center (EDC) in Eloy, Arizona, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-SerawitGezahegnDejene.pdf.. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25061. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

        "communication": "I appeal the agency's blanket b7A assertion on two grounds. \r\n\r\nFirst, there is no \"ongoing law enforcement investigation[]\" that could result in a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, as required to invoke Exemption 7A. Rather, the investigations ICE performs following an in-custody death -- IHSC Mortality Reviews, Root Cause Analyses, Healthcare and Security Compliance Analyses, and Detainee Death Reviews, pertain solely to \"oversight of the performance of duties\", rather than an investigation into violations of laws. See, e.g., Jefferson v. DOJ, 284 F.3d 172, 178 (D.C. Cir. 2002). They cannot be fairly characterized, based upon ICE's publicly available policies and procedures and the history of its post-death inspections, to anything constituting an \"enforcement proceeding.\" Consequently, they do not meet Exemption 7A's requirements. Miller v. DOJ, 872 F. Supp. 2d 12, 24-25 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that focus is on circumstances of compilation and whether records relate to enforcement proceeding (citing Jefferson 284 F.3d at 176-77)); Rural Hous. All. v. USDA, 498 F.2d 73, 82 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (explaining that purpose of investigatory files is critical factor in establishing law enforcement threshold); Pub. Emps. for Env't Resp. v. U.S. Sec'y. Int'l Boundary & Water Comm'n, 839 F. Supp. 2d 304, 324 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that in \"assessing whether records were compiled for law enforcement purposes, the 'focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested files were compiled, and whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be characterized as an enforcement proceeding'\" (quoting Jefferson, 284 F.3d at 176-77)), aff'd in pertinent part & rev'd on other grounds, 740 F.3d 195 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\r\n\r\nSecond, even if the agency were able to show its allegedly ongoing investigations satisfy the threshold for invoking Exemption 7A, the blanket assertion of the exemption to all potentially responsive records is unlawful and improper. A record-by-record analysis is required to determine whether there is any reasonably segregable, releasable portion of the responsive documents that would not interfere with the ongoing investigation. But ICE did not conduct this analysis. According to the Department of Justice and every court to review agencies\u2019 assertions of the power to engage in blanket 7A withholdings simply because of the existence of an investigation, blanket withholding is unlawful. See, e.g., https://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1197166/download at page 11: \u201cWhile generalized showings of harm are accepted, courts have also cautioned that the exemption [7A] does not permit \u2018blanket\u2019 withholding.\u201d See, e.g., Cuban, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 85 (D.D.C. 2010) (stressing that exemption does not permit \"blanket\" withholding for all records relevant to investigation); UtahAmerica Energy v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 700 F. Supp. 2d 99, 109 (D.D.C. 2010), rev'd in part, vacated in part sub nom. UtahAmerica Energy, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor, 685 F.3d 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (reiterating that \"automatic, or wholesale withholdings\" are not authorized simply because law enforcement proceeding is ongoing); United Am. Fin. v. Potter, 531 F. Supp. 2d 29, 3840 (D.D.C. 2008) (reiterating that the agency \u2018should be mindful of the standards applicable in this Circuit\" and that even under categorical approach, agency must review each document because there is \"no 'blanket exemption'\"); Gould Inc. v. GSA, 688 F. Supp. 689, 703-04 n.34 (D.D.C. 1988) (describing generic categories approach as steering \"middle ground\" between detail required by Vaughn Index and blanket withholding).\r\n\r\nPlease grant expedited processing of this appeal, reverse the decision of the FOIA office, and remand to the agency with instructions to release the record in full. \r\n\r\nThank you very much, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

And should that exclude classified employees? We can provide job descriptions which would also include grade once you clarify.\r\n\r\nThe \"President's Report\" included all titles for all full-time employees. The collective bargaining agreements we provided do have all salary grades for each of the unions.  The Professional Association covers all non-executive full-time staff & faculty (excluding classified which are covered in the UPSEU CBAs.) Our management confidential positions do not have salary grades.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCrystal\r\n\r\nCrystal Marceau\r\nExecutive Director of Human Resources\r\nPayne Hall 349\r\nMohawk Valley Community College | 1101 Sherman Drive | Utica NY  13501\r\nPhone: 315.792.5637\r\nFax: 315.731.5858\r\n\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DBBA7B.79D38290]\r\n\r\nRelator | Responsibility | Arranger| Individualization | Analytical",

If any costs apply, please notify me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific exemption under Florida law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Chad Weaver at 2629 Academy Ave in Deltona, Florida. Weaver mistakenly responded to the wrong address for a burglary alarm and confronted Rollins as she was backing out of a driveway. The situation escalated quickly, and Rollins was charged with four felonies, including battery on a law enforcement officer. Bodycam footage was released following criticism on social media regarding the deputy\u2019s conduct. In April 2023, Rollins\u2019 attorney filed a motion to suppress evidence, citing Fourth Amendment violations.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to all records related to the arrest of Iyanna Rollins by Sgt. Chad Weaver on June 18, 2022, at or near 2629 Academy Avenue, Deltona, Florida:\r\n\r\nAll body-worn camera footage from Sgt. Chad Weaver and any other responding deputies.\r\n\r\nAny dash camera footage from patrol vehicles involved in the incident.\r\n\r\nAny rear seat camera footage from the vehicle in which Rollins was transported.\r\n\r\nThe full incident report, arrest report, and any supplemental or narrative reports.\r\n\r\nAudio of dispatch communications or 911 calls related to the original burglary alarm.\r\n\r\nAny internal communications or emails regarding the public release of the footage.\r\n\r\nAny social media video or surveillance footage obtained or referenced by the Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\nIf any additional records exist regarding the motion to suppress or internal discussion of the arrest controversy, I would also request those under this same request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Brett Carollo: This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated March 7, 2024, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.\u00a0 Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 24-00589-F.\u00a0 Please include this case number when communicating with this office. The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

In the interim, we have taken the step to \"push\" a system-generated invitation to create a PAL account to you.  You should receive an email from address noreply_nfo@epa.gov<mailto:noreply_nfo@epa.gov> with instructions on how to take the next steps to successfully establish the PAL account.\r\n\r\nIf you chose to establish this account, this would then ensure that all future interim and final responses from your FOIA requests to EPA will be available for download via the PAL.  It will also allow you to submit any new requests to U.S. EPA using your PAL account.\r\nRegards,\r\nRebecca Clausen, on behalf of the\r\nEPA FOIAXpress Implementation Team",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Elizondo-Pinochi: \r\n\r\nI  previously submitted a public records request to the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) regarding current mental health staff. I was informed that NDOC does not maintain these records and that the Department of Administration (specifically Human Resources) is the custodian, to which I submitted a public records request.\r\n\r\nHowever, the DOA has now replied stating they are not the custodian and referred me back to NDOC. To simplify the request and avoid unnecessary burden, I\u2019d like to narrow the scope to a single question:\r\n\r\nCould you kindly provide the name(s) and contact information (email or phone) for the individual or individuals responsible for overseeing mental health or behavioral health programming within Nevada Department of Corrections facilities \u2014 such as a Chief Psychologist, Mental Health Director, or similar supervisory role?\r\n\t\u2022\tFull name\r\n\t\u2022\tJob title\r\n\t\u2022\tAssigned facility\r\n\t\u2022\tWork email and/or phone number (if available)\r\n\t\u2022\tDepartment (e.g. Behavioral Health)\r\n\r\nI understand many services are contracted out \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, any direction you could offer (e.g. relevant points of contact at the contracting entity) would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFor context: I\u2019m reaching out as part of a nonprofit initiative exploring the possibility of offering free meditation-based rehabilitation programming to incarcerated populations across the U.S., including Nevada. Similar programs have been successfully implemented in state and federal prisons in the U.S. and abroad, with evidence showing significant benefits to inmate well-being and facility safety.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",

Clerical (ESPA), Security (ESPA) Maintenance and Operations (TSPA) is civil service: https://www.niagaracounty.gov/employment/job_specs_for_civil_service_positions.php.

All other employees are in a CBA.\r\n\r\nFollow Up: Is it possible to get a copy of that? The current one does not show non-faculty positions with the salaries\r\n\r\n2.

The only releasable case was uploaded to the portal, along with a copy of the AG's ruling on 24-1791. I am still waiting on HR to get back with whether or not there is any reprimands in his file and will write again once they get back with me.***** For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any communications, on or after April 1, 2025, concerning the planned appearance by Ryan Holiday on April 14, 2025, as reported in this New York Times piece: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/naval-academy-speech-censorship.html.\r\n\r\n2. Any communications, on or after April 1, 2025, concerning the cancellation, postponement, or rescheduling of Ryan Holiday's April 14, 2025 appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the removal of books from a library due to their viewpoints or content and the cancellation of a speech on the basis that discussion of those books (or their removal) might violate an order of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted media coverage, including the Associated Press report identified above. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the cancellation of a speech based on its contents or viewpoint.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations. That information is not in the public domain and relates to a decision that has received attention from a prominent newspaper.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

I reviewed all the data and had some points of clarification.\r\n\r\n- Would you potentially have a census (full time or part time, class title, grades, min and max) of the staff at the organization? I noticed the various contracts for positions, but it seems that's only roughly 30 or so positions. I saw the staff's name further down in one document. However, those seem to be on the smaller scale as well.\r\n- Do you have job descriptions for the class titles?\r\n- A pay plan to match the worker with the grade?",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request all records related to Gen. John Kirk Singlaub. Singlaub was born July 10, 1921 in what is now Independence, California, USA. He died January 29, 2022.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT:\r\n\r\nIn May 1977, Singlaub (then the Army's third-ranking official on the Korean Peninsula) spoke out publicly against President Carter's decision to withdraw 32,000 ground troops from the Korean Peninsula.\r\n\r\nGen. Singlaub started the U.S. Council for World Freedom, an affiliate of the World Anti-Communist League. In addition, Gen. Singlaub was involved with the Western Goals Foundation, a private domestic intelligence group bankrolled by conservative Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt to gather information on leftist groups and their leaders. Gen. Singlaub\u2019s chief function in what the Los Angeles Times called the business of \u201cprivate-enterprise insurgency\u201d was raising millions of dollars to supply arms to anti-communist paramilitaries in places such as Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and Laos. He was also the chairman of the OSS Society, a group that seeks to preserve the legacy of the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. In the early 1980s, as Congress began curtailing U.S. funding of efforts to overthrow leftist regimes in Nicaragua and elsewhere, Gen. Singlaub and his organizations remained an important conduit of materiel and financial assistance to right-wing paramilitaries, reportedly with the help of deep-pocketed conservatives and foreign governments.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: \r\n\r\nIn addition to standard practices, please search the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nPlease include a cross-reference search of the following things to see if they contain additional records related to Gen. Singlaub: U.S. COUNCIL FOR WORLD FREEDOM, WORLD ANTI-COMMUNIST LEAGUE, WESTERN GOALS FOUNDATION, OSS SOCIETY\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Gen. Singlaub has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Gen. Singlaub was a public figure. News obituaries for Gen. Singlaub appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Gen. Singlaub has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Gen. Singlaub's status as a U.S. Army General, a public figure, and a private funder of right-wing paramilitaries, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
