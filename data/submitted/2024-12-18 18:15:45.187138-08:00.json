All elected officials (including mayors, trustees, commissioners, and other elected and appointed officials).\r\n\r\n2. Immediate family members (including spouses, children, parents and other immediate relatives) of the officials listed above.\r\n\r\nFor each payment plan, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nThe recipient\u2019s full name (unless prohibited by law, which I dispute as outlined below).\r\n\r\nThe address or account location related to the payment plan.\r\n\r\nThe total payment amount and schedule of payments associated with the payment plan.\r\n\r\nThe effective date of the payment plan and any records related to its approval.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence or documentation regarding how eligibility for the payment plan was determined.\r\n\r\nI understand that under FOIA (and related state public records laws), agencies may attempt to withhold or redact the names and addresses of individuals under the claim that such information is \"personal\" or \"private.\" However, I respectfully submit that in this case, such redactions would be inappropriate and contrary to the public interest.\r\n\r\nWhile private citizens generally have a reasonable expectation of privacy, public officials and their immediate family members do not share the same expectation when it comes to receiving public benefits or financial relief.\r\n\r\nThe information requested (names, addresses, and payment plans) does not expose sensitive private information like Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, or health data. Instead, it reveals details of how public resources are being allocated, which is precisely the type of information public records laws are designed to make accessible.\r\n\r\nPublic disclosure is essential to allow journalists, watchdog groups, and citizens to identify patterns of favoritism or special treatment for certain individuals or groups.\r\n\r\nNames and addresses are already found in public property records, voting rolls, and other public databases. If the recipient\u2019s name and address are already public in other contexts, redacting them here serves no meaningful privacy interest but instead obstructs accountability.\r\n\r\n*****If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, I ask that you provide the following:\r\n\r\n1. The specific legal exemption(s) being claimed for each redaction or denial.\r\n\r\n2. An explanation of how the exemption applies to the specific information being withheld.\r\n\r\n3. A list or index of withheld documents, as required under applicable \"Vaughn Index\" procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\nThank you for your public records request, attached above for your convenience. For the following reason, public records is unable to process this request at this time.\r\nIn Nebraska, the basic rule for open public records is set out in Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712 (2014). That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \"all citizens of this state and all other persons interested in the examination of the public records...\" shall have the right to examine records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memoranda and abstracts from those records, and to obtain copies of records in certain circumstances. The request we received for the records listed above came from MuckRock.com. It requires us to respond to MuckRock.com directly, i.e., either by email to MuckRock.com, upload responsive records to a MuckRock filesharing platform, or sent the responsive records by U.S. Mail addressed to \"MuckRock News\" in Boston, Massachusetts. However, MuckRock.com is neither a Nebraska citizen nor an interested person and, as a result, we do not consider this third-party request to be valid under the statute referenced above.\r\n\r\nAlthough no information was withheld as a result of this request due to the status of the requestor, public records provides the following appeal rights found in Neb. Rev., Stat. \u00a7 84-712.03. If you believe the withholding of information requested is in error, you have the right, pursuant to Nebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 84-712.03, to appeal the decision by filing for relief by a writ of mandamus in the District Court in Lancaster County, Nebraska or to petition the Nebraska Attorney General for review of this denial. For the purpose of an appeal, Thomas Skutt is the State official responsible for the decision to deny any portion of your request.\r\n\r\nNothing in this email shall be construed as a promise or guarantee, of any type, that public records responsive to your request exist or can be produced. If the public record exists, withholding or redaction may be required by applicable law.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nThomas Skutt, Jr., JD | Public Records and Discovery Attorney III\r\nLEGAL SERVICES\r\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services\r\nOFFICE: 402-471-7020   |   FAX: 402-742-2374\r\nDHHS.ne.gov<http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/default.aspx>  |  Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/NEDHHS/>  |  Twitter<https://twitter.com/NEDHHS>  |  LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/nebraska-department-of-health-and-human-services>\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message, including any attachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
