To avoid any unwarranted invasions of privacy, I\u2019m specifically seeking the de-identified, aggregate data annually from January 1, 2020, through January 1, 2025, including the following: \r\n   1. The number of adolescent offenders, as well as juvenile offenders, including those granted youthful offender status, under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\r\n   2. Offender demographics including: total arrest dispositions, age at the time of offense, race, gender, and county convicted/adjudicated.\r\n   3. If collected in the same data, demographics of the victim including: age, gender, and race.\r\n   4. If collected in the same data, number of petitions filed and status (approved/denied/in progress). \r\nI ask that, if possible, you provide any potentially responsive records as an electronic spreadsheet or searchable database format. Should you deny this request in whole or in part, I ask that you detail your reasons for doing so in writing, citing the applicable statutes.\r\nThis information is being sought in the regular course of newsgathering on behalf of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism for dissemination to the general public. \r\nI\u2019m requesting that you waive any fees associated with production of potentially responsive records. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how the state and local authorities work together to monitor sex offender status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Maria Guinnip.",
