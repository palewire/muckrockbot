This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam Levin",

She had been abducted near her bus stop in Englewood, Colorado the night prior and she had also been sexually assaulted. In 2019, James Curtis Clanton was arrested for Helene\u2019s murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2020. According to detectives in this case the department used a forensic psychic or a subject under hypnosis, among other tools, to help hunt down Prusynski's murderer. I am looking for records reflecting the number of cases psychics or hypnosis has been used by the department since the year 2000. \r\n\r\nAfter speaking to the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the agency determined it had no records indicating the number of cases psychics or hypnosis had been used.  The agency told me that The Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was handling the Helene Pruszynski murder investigation at the time, so the CBI is the custodian of any contracting records and investigatory records produced by the forensic psychic or the hypnosis in that particular case. \r\n\r\nTo that end I am looking I am looking for any records including contracting records as well as any investigatory records produced by any forensic psychic or hypnotist during the course of any investigation CBI used their services. I am also looking for records reflecting the number of cases psychics or hypnosis has been used by CBI since the year 2000.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
