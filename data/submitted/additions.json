Please include the same data. If it is necessary to break it up into multiple tabs or spreadsheets, that's fine. \r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1THS1IqKCBxlc8pA7KF1XE6rTWpHV0DpF/view?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nPlease note these budgets were not just cited and identified, but required by CPS to be presented and approved at public meetings. Consequently they are explicitly excluded from the preliminary draft exemption under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f): \"a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\" \r\n\r\n Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or require clarification.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnthony Moser",
