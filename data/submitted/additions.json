        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA list of the abutters of 0 Lake Street that received a certified letter from the Conservation Commission date December 6, 2023 that states:\r\n\"Dear Abutters, \r\nThe Conservation Commission has been assessing each of their properties to determine the health of the land that they own. One of those properties that was recently assessed is 0 Lake St, a thin conservation easement that run between Squire Lane and Reservoir Drive. Through this, it has come to our attention that some abutters have been using this land to dump yard waste, dog poop, etc. The town does not allow dumping or changes to be made to the land without knowledge and consent from the Conservation Commission. If you are one of the abutters conducting these types of actions, we politely ask you to remove your waste by January 1, 2024. This site will be checked again and if this issue has not been resolved, we will have to take further action. If you have any further questions or concerns about what can and cannot be done within a conservation easement, you can reach out to the Conservation Department @ (508) 657-2858 or by emailing hccrawford@bellinghamma.org......\"\r\nIn addition please include the name of the person(s) that brought the issue to the \"attention\" of the conservation commission or any meeting notes discussing the issue.\r\nPlease include the dates that the Conservation Committee visited and assessed the areas in question to \"determine the health of the land they own\"  prior to the letter being sent to the abutters, and their findings of that assessment.\r\nPlease include all the assessments /dates/and maintenance by the town/conservation commission to maintain the  area the Commission has identified as 0 Lake Street between December 1989 to the present.\r\nPlease include any potential conflicts of interest of potential former Conservation Commission members that are also abutters.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGERALDINE HOUDE",
