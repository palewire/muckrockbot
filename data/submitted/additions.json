Yoheliza Yanez as a subject. For specificity and to rule out duplicates, PO Yoheliza Yanez was arrested on October 14, 2022 in the confines of the 102 Precinct in the County of Queens, New York. \r\n\r\nDivisions that may hold responsive records include Internal Affairs, Employment Management, and Department Advocate's Office; however, any record used to evaluate performance toward the subject's continued employment or promotion should be considered responsive.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Law as amended by Chapter 96 of the Laws of New York of 2020, records that may be released include \"the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee; the name of the employee complained of or charged; the transcript of any disciplinary trial or hearing, including any exhibits introduced at such trial or hearing; the disposition of any disciplinary proceeding; and the final written opinion or memorandum supporting the disposition and discipline imposed including the agency's complete factual findings and its analysis of the conduct and appropriate discipline of the covered employee.\"\r\n\r\nUnder precedent, Freedom of Information Law uses a \"balancing test\" method of weighing privacy interests favoring redaction/denial against the public interest in favor of disclosure. This matter is of clear public interest for the following reasons: P.O.
