Rather than provide all responsive records at once, I ask that you provide copies of records on a rolling basis, as they become available. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease waive any applicable fees; this information is being sought for reporting purposes. If I can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me directly, at mdrange@insider.com.\r\n\r\nAs provided in the open records law, I will expect your response within fifteen (15) business days. Note: a delay in access to these records is tantamount to a denial of access. \r\n\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Rudenberg, a citizen of Delaware, in coordination with Insider Staff.",
