To clarify that would specifically be Elk Grove Municipal Code (EGMC) Sections 16.18.1100 through 16.18.1139;\r\n  *   The nature of the request appears to focus on matters that resulted in a police response.  Generally speaking, in the City of Elk Grove the Code Enforcement Division would handle most originating calls relating to matters under Elk Grove Municipal Code (EGMC) Sections 16.18.1100 through 16.18.1139.  From the request, it appears you are not seeking Code Enforcement cases on the whole, but rather only those that included police involvement in the response?\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, feel free to contact me by phone at 1-916-478-2286, or email at jlindgren@elkgrovecity.org<mailto:jlindgren@elkgrovecity.org>.\r\n\r\n[Green tree City of Elk Grove]\r\nJason Lindgren (he/him)\r\nCity Clerk\r\nOffice of the City Clerk\r\n\r\nCity of Elk Grove\r\n8401 Laguna Palms Way, Elk Grove, CA 95758\r\nPhone: 916.478.2286\r\nTTY/TDD 888.435.6092\r\nelkgrovecity.org<http://www.elkgrovecity.org/>\r\n\r\nSign Up for Email Updates<https://www.elkgrovecity.org/public-affairs/subscribe-newsletters>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nBy sending us an email (electronic mail message) or filling out a web form, you are sending us personal information (i.e. your name, address, email address or other information).

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to, mentioning, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry for Donald David DeFreeze, aka Cinque Mtume, aka General Field Marshal Cinque (November 16, 1943 \u2013 May 17, 1974).\r\n\r\nThis information has already been released previously. Page 11 of the FBI's 2003 FOIA log, attached, indicates journalist Tom O'Neill filed FOIPA request 961930-001 the year prior. The bureau reopened the request on May 15, 2003, and closed it again on May 3, 2005. The log discloses that 1,812 pages were released as part of that request, thus I am requesting all information previously released in that request and any additional information released since then.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. DeFreeze's privacy, as he passed away in 1974. I have attached a reproduction of an obituary, published in The New York Times on May 24, 1974.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

However, while that email message included 6 categories of cases that should be de-calendared, we have consistently received these notices only in one category of case that was not listed in Tracy Short's April, 2022 email. Specifically, the only cases being taken off the country in Kansas City, where I practice, are cancellation of removal cases set for trial. \r\n\r\nTo better understand what explains this apparent deviation from the current policy, I am requesting any guidance since April 21, 2022 to Immigration Judges about which cases should be removed from the court's calendar. This may include policy memoranda or email messages. Assuming this guidance was disseminated to the \"All of OCIJ HDQ and Courts (EOIR)\" email address, please search that account for the phrase \"taking cases off.\" If that guidance was disseminated in some other manner, please contact me to discuss possible search terms.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process.

        "communication": "Dear Matthew Hoppock, \nThis response acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\u00a0 Your request has been assigned control number 2023-78734. \nPlease be advised that the status of requests submitted through the Public Access Link (PAL) may be tracked at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) , and you will receive an email response to your request upon completion of processing. The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you \nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files . EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \n \nSincerely, \nFOIA Intake\n",

If it's easier to do on a call with you, or with someone else in your office, we'd appreciate that as well.\r\n\r\n- Tab number 4 doesn't seem to correspond to the summary sheet's #4. The breakdown sheet's tab 4 has grant status as DENIED as opposed to GRANTED and the total is 2962 compared to 198,712.\r\n- For number 2 and 4, why are the orders granted numbers so incredibly high compared to number of petitions filed in #1? Are the orders numbers cumulative in nature meaning each year's data includes all previous years too? Can you please explain how these relate to number of petitions filed?\r\n- Tab 15 is missing from the breakdown sheet\r\n- For a few of the tabs, the totals in the breakdown sheet tabs is much higher than what is listed on the summary page- Tabs 5, 11, 14 & 16\r\n- For a few of the tabs, the totals in the summary sheet is higher by a little (ranging from a few hundred to a handful) but there's no explanation for that.- Tabs 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, & 13\r\n\r\nThank you again for continuing to help with this.

Some expire, some are temporary, some may even be reoccurring or overturned. The unit responsible for gathering the data you requested did it to the best of their ability. The status of a PFA, reasons for PFA's, and relation to firearm permissions is not always the same. Unfortunately, we are not a repository for all law enforcement agencies within Pennsylvania, so we cannot explain all variances in data. The PSP does enter information provided to us, but we do not maintain all records for all petitions.\r\n\r\nThe sheets correlate to the requested information with the exception of what was provided in the letter; \"15. The total number of firearms relinquished to attorneys at law,\" stated in the table,  and \"17. The total number of firearms that were not returned after the expiration of the order because the respondent was prohibited from firearm possession,\" as there is no data in our possession to provide for that.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to \"Filegate\", which arose in June 1996 around improper White House access in 1993 and 1994 to Federal Bureau of Investigation security-clearance documents. Access to the files, allegedly without permission, was given to Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, with estimates ranging from 400 to 900 unauthorized file disclosures.\r\n\r\nI request that processing be expedited, as there is widespread interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence. This is especially relevant given the upcoming election, in which Hillary Clinton (suspected by some of wrongdoing in 'Filegate') is a candidate. I certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I request that fees be waived, as the documents will be used to facilitate news stories which enhance the public's understanding of the government's handling of alleged wrongdoing. The documents will also be made available through the nonprofit Internet Archive's national security collection. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nI'm contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Filegate. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 2893 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  I can be reached via email at rbronson@fbi.gov, or you may call me at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRebecca Bronson\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\n540-868-1695",

Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 80 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 281 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 774 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 879 days.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nOur records reflect no posted payment associated with 1334485-001; rather, your request was reopened on 11-20-2015 upon receipt of your cost letter response reflecting commitment to pay the estimated fees.  No fees have been formally assessed related to this request to date.\r\n\r\nAs indicated on our Status Update website, http://vault.fbi.gov under the \u201cCheck Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u201d link, your request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.  Please continue to check the status of your request using the provided website, as statuses are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is March 2018.\r\n\r\nOur records reflect in April 2016, the negotiation analyst made two attempts to contact you regarding the option to potentially reduce the scope of your request in an effort to receive the records more quickly; no response was received at the time.  Please be advised reducing the scope of your request can accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please notify us in writing.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov> if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nElectronic FBI FOIPA request submissions are accepted at http://efoia.fbi.gov<http://efoia.fbi.gov/>.\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOIPA process?

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Crillon C. Payne, II, aka Crillon Payne, aka Cril Payne  (May 28, 1943 \u2013 June 18, 2006). Mr. Payne worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1968 and 1976 as an undercover agent investigating domestic terrorist groups in the antiwar movement. He wrote a memoir about his experiences of his time at the Bureau which was published by Newsweek Books in 1979 as \"Deep Cover: An FBI Agent Infiltrates the Radical Underground\". In the book, Mr. Payne states that he was given informant designation \"LA 7852-S (Extremist)\" as part of a Domestic Intelligence Division operation known as the Special Informant Development Program (SPECTAR). According to Mr. Payne, this operation was created to target terrorist group the Weather Underground. As such, I am requesting all records related to Mr. Payne under all previously stated permutations of his name, LA 7852-S (Extremist), and LA 7852-S.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Payne's privacy, as he passed away on June 18, 2006. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Payne's obituary in the Austin American-Statesman. For expediency's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/statesman/name/crillon-payne-obituary?id=26854114\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Payne publicly revealed his work with the the Bureau in his memoir, removing any further concerns over privacy. The fact that he published a memoir about his undercover work would also make him a figure of public interest; \"Deep Cover\" received media attention in national newspapers and on radio stations at the time of its publication.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Director, Office of Information Policy\r\nU.S. Department of Justice\r\n441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor\r\nWashington, D.C. 20530\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 2023\r\n\r\nGreetings:\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 2023, I submitted Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request number 158-1024-000 via Muckrock. In this request, I asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for records on Crillon C. Payne, II, aka Cril Payne, a former FBI agent and author.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 2023, I received two response letters from the FBI; one acknowledging receipt of the request and stating records were being reviewed for processing, and another denying my request for a fee waiver due to insufficient cause for public interest. I am appealing the second decision and requesting a reconsideration on the denial of the fee waiver.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nAs I noted in my original request, Mr. Payne is a former FBI agent who made extraordinary claims in a 1979 memoir, \u201cDeep Cover: An FBI Agent Infiltrates the Radical Underground\u201d. In his book, Mr. Payne states that he went undercover into radical antiwar groups in the early 1970s, in pursuit of a domestic terrorist group, the Weather Underground. This alone should qualify Mr. Payne and his work for the bureau as a subject of public interest, given the level of media attention the Weather Underground has generated both contemporaneously and in the present. At the time of its release, Mr. Payne\u2019s book was covered by no less than the New York Times; and in the present, it is referenced in recent histories about the Weather Underground, such as Arthur Eckstein\u2019s 2016 non-fiction book \u201cBad Moon Rising: How the Weather Underground Beat the FBI and Lost the Revolution\u201d (please see: end note 36, for chapter 6, on page 315), and post-mortem histories on the Nixon administration\u2019s domestic surveillance policies, as in Daniel Chard\u2019s 2021 non-fiction book \u201cNixon\u2019s War at Home: The FBI, Leftist Guerillas, and the Origins of Counterterrorism\u201d (please see: end note 76, for chapter 8, on page 321).\r\n\r\nThe problem, however, is that these references can rely only on Mr. Payne\u2019s testimony, not on any additional documentary evidence. For example, in Daniel Chard\u2019s \u201cNixon\u2019s War at Home\u201d, in the end note immediately following his reference to Mr. Payne\u2019s account of his time infiltrating a Weather Underground-adjacent group, Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), Chard states: \u201cThe VVAW FBI files are currently available electronically \u2026 Among other things, more information is needed on the relationship between the FBI\u2019s investigation and operations carried out by local police, [the Committee to Re-elect the President], and other federal agencies.\u201d Mr. Chard is a respected historian who teaches and writes about American social movements at Western Washington University.\r\n\r\nThis highlights a significant problem in the public\u2019s understanding of radical groups: the VVAW FBI files, while useful, are incomplete, as they do not include any references to Mr. Payne. And in the absence of the bureau\u2019s records on Mr. Payne, claims made in his book cannot be substantiated. As of 2023, the VVAW FBI files are scattered across the Internet, with many now only accessible using the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, a web portal that archives old webpages, further complicating attempts authenticate claims made by the various parties involved; or they exist in bits and pieces, collected in different physical archives throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is important because My. Payne, in his book, devotes a substantial amount of space to detailing one of his undercover operations, a fake antiwar group known as the November Committee, which he claims was made up of FBI agents posing as antiwar activists (please see: chapter 3 of \u201cDeep Cover\u201d). He describes using this front group to infiltrate the VVAW during its \u201cOperation Last Patrol,\u201d a cross-country caravan of VVAW members from Southern California to Miami in the summer of 1972 (please see: chapters 4 and 5). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Payne claims in his book that the FBI created a special program within its Domestic Intelligence Division, called the Special Informant Development Program (SPECTAR), so that it could infiltrate the Weather Underground. The only known references to SPECTAR come from Mr. Payne. Corroborating or refuting the existence of SPECTAR would help greatly in understanding how the government conducted surveillance operations targeting Americans citizens during the 1970s.\r\n\r\nThus, any records the bureau might have on Mr. Payne would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, both with regard to its investigations of the Weather Underground\u2014for which two bureau agents, W. Mark Felt and Edward S. Miller, were convicted of conspiracy, although both were later pardoned\u2014and the VVAW. That the Weather Underground in particular continues to recur as a subject of academic and public interest, and Mr. Payne\u2019s book routinely appears in some form or fashion in those projects, indicates that contrary to the bureau\u2019s claim, there is a compelling public interest in the release of Mr. Payne\u2019s records. The fee waiver would help to further this interest, as any records received pertaining to Mr. Payne would be made available to the public.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the FBI's Information Management Division does in processing FOIPA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Brown,\r\n\r\nI'm contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Sajida al-Rishawi. The FBI located approximately 1758 pages and 14 media CDs that are potentially responsive to your request. I just wanted to let you know about the potential waiting time for a request of this size.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing. Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request. \r\n\r\nWe contact folks with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope of the request. Is this something you might be willing to consider? I can help you decide how to reduce the scope. We can narrow the request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we can approach it that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed. I can be reached at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday from 7:00 am until 3:30 pm, Eastern time, or you can reply to this email if you prefer.\r\n\nThanks much,\r\nBecki\r\n\r\nRebecca Bronson\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-1695",

The other photo subfile sections duplicate the two I\u2019d recommend keeping. The two remaining subfiles contain third-party interviews and newspaper clippings. The third-party interviews would be largely exempt from disclosure, so I would recommend eliminating those, and the newspaper clippings are available freely elsewhere.\r\n\r\nKeeping the main file sections and the three subfile sections would move the request out of the large track and give you 559 pages.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request metadata relating to emails sent To, From, CC, or BCC the following accounts:\r\n\r\nLance McDaniel from the beginning of time (or January 1, 2000) operating in any capacity within the government, or serving on any advisory board. Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: or any other emails corresponding to this individual including jaromeg@earthlink.com, .\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2000 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This email serves to clarify the request for additional information regarding the FOIA request sent on March 18th, specifically related to the following statement request: \"memorandums, plans, completion documents, and other related documents pertaining to debris removal and disaster waste management in Puerto Rico throughout recovery from Hurricane Maria.\". Below, I attempt to describe, and/or provide examples of, the associated documents in greater detail. \r\n\r\nPlans: For Hurricane Maria, USACE utilized a Debris Planning and Response Team to coordinate the debris removal response (e.g. how many trucks to send where). This FOIA requests access to written plans developed by the Debris Planning and Response team in response to Hurricane Maria. \r\n\r\nMemorandums/Completion documents - Each municipality receiving USACE assistance for debris removal signed a memorandum or completion document, visible at the following two links. This FOIA requests copies of each municipality's completion document: https://www.dvidshub.net/image/4199238/usace-completes-debris-removal-dorado-puerto-rico AND https://www.dvidshub.net/image/4186743/caguas-physical-completion-debris-removal \r\n\r\nRelated documents include but are not limited to, for example, documents pertaining to the environmental assessments, quality assurance documents, and site leases for debris collection (temporary debris management sites) as referenced here: https://www.sam.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/1415867/usace-emergency-response-missions-include-debris-removal-and-temporary-power-ge/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of,in%20Puerto%20Rico%20to%20date . \r\n\r\nI hope this provides greater insight and thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Obviously, it is black-letter law that the FOIA cannot obligate an agency to create a record that does not already exist. Nonetheless, I take this opportunity to ask, to beg, to plead, and to beseech the Bureau: send me a record featuring a picture of J.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of (U//FOUO) Anarchist Extremists Likely to Exploit 01 May Events for\r\n    Violent Activity\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Thank you for your prompt response. I really do appreciate the work of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, and if you can, please send them my regards for all the records they've helped unearth.\r\n\r\nIn his response letter dated 19 April 2024, Section Chief Michael G. Seidel wrote that \"we are releasing documents from previous requests regarding your subject. We consider your request fulfilled. Since we relied on previous results, additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist. If this release of previously processed material does not satisfy your request, you may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one particular additional record I would like to request a search for. In 2016, the FBI released something called an \"HVT List\" with the following headers: \"Requester | Total Cases | Total IP Cases | Percent of Total Cases | Percent of Current IP Pending | Submitted Since January | Submitted Within Fiscal Year.\" In 2020, the FBI released a similar list with slightly different headers. You may find copies of both attached.\r\n\r\nIf such a document exists today, please release the most recent version. Thank you again for your efforts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMatthew",
