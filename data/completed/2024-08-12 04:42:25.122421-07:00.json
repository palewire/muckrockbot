With regard to agencies that have submitted probe photos, please provide logs, lists or datasets describing, as available, the requesting organization, the number of requests made, the dates of the requests, and the number of requests granted.  If the Commission maintains this information in an Excel spreadsheet, I request that the record be produced in this format.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Tepper",

Mr. Marrow was born in Newark, New Jersey. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1977 to 1979 and achieved the rank of petty officer, second class. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Marrow, known popularly as the rapper Ice-T, should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Marrow\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

After his comment, the Village of Niles Board President George Alpogianis responded:\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I know I don't respond to things, but I will respond to this. When we start taking care of our veterans first and getting them out of their tents. All the homeless veterans that we have damn right we'll help anybody.

Thank you. \u201c[3]\r\n\r\nThe board went on to approve this ordinance with no discussion or further comment.[4]\r\n\r\nTo that effect we are seeking emails from village of Niles email addresses between November 1, 2023 and the date this request is processed (inclusive of those dates) that include any of the following keywords in the subject line and/or body:\r\n\r\n\u2013 \"migrant\"\r\n\u2013 \"asylum\"\r\n\u2013 \"immigrant\"\r\n\u2013 \"refugee\"\r\n\u2013 \"unscheduled bus stop\"\r\n\r\nPlease include any email attachments.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 279279.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 13 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\n(b)(6)/(b)(7)(C) \nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), 13 pages have been released with 12 pages in part. Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld \n\nWe are withholding third party information, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6). To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). \nWe are withholding specific law enforcement codes, techniques, and procedures used in our investigation pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(E) exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records or information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). The information withheld reveals various law enforcement file numbers and codes which are primarily used to store and retrieve law enforcement information. The information withheld also reveals specific law enforcement procedures and techniques used in this investigation. Disclosure of this information could enable individuals outside of the agency to circumvent agency functions and gain access to sensitive investigative information. Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d \n\nSincerely, \n\nHirsh D. Kravitz \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division",

The number of search terms used and general nature of the search terms used (e.g., Heritage Foundation, EIN) is pulling in a lot of general and non-responsive information (examples attached).  For example, the term \u201cEIN\u201d which is presumably being used as an acronym for \u201cElection Integrity Network\u201d is hitting on the false positive \u201cEIN#\u201d or employee identification number (see page 4 of the attachment).  Additionally, the searches are producing several general newsletters and mass mailers which may delay the processing of your request.  Is it ok if we exclude false positives, general newsletters and mass mailers to help facilitate processing?\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss anything further, please feel free to email us back or I can be contacted directly at the number below.\nBest regards,\r\nJustin Riches\r\nPublic Records Counsel\r\n(602) 926-5507",

Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Section 7(1)(f) exempts from release \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)].

Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Section 7(d)(iv) of the FOIA exempts confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

Mr. Bridges was born in Los Angeles, California. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1967 to 1975 and achieved the rank of petty officer second class. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Bridges, an Academy Award-winning film actor , should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Bridges Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

This does mean that it can take time to process requests, but we work to provide requestors with installments of their records on a timely basis. \r\nWe reasonably anticipate an installment/requested records will be available on or before August 9, 2024. If public records become available in advance of this estimate, we will let you know. Conversely, if staff encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will advise accordingly. \r\nWith respect to audio recordings, please be advised that Spokane Regional Emergency Communications (\"SREC\") is the custodian of 911/Crime Check audio recordings as well as audio recordings of radio traffic. If you are attempting to obtain audio recordings of 911/Crime Check calls and/or radio traffic, you need to submit a separate request to SREC directly via the following link: https://srec911.com/ \r\nFinally, please be advised that there may be fees associated with the copying of public records. Please take a moment to  familiarize yourself with Spokane County's Public Records Request Policy and Fee Schedule, which can be found in the FAQs section. \r\nSincerely, \r\nJOHN F.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Mint:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

The response from an FOIA Representative was provided stating that \u201cFOIA Exemption 3. FOIA Exemption 3 permits withholding of records specifically exempted from disclosure by another Federal statute. In this instance, 10 USC \u00a7 130e states, in part, that the Department of Defense (DOD) may exempt critical infrastructure security information where such disclosure would reveal vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would likely result in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to DOD operations, property or facilities. In a letter dated June 2, 2017, the DOD informed the FAA that DOD flight data constitutes DOD Critical Infrastructure Information (DCRIT) and is therefore exempt from disclosure in accordance with this statute\u201d signed by Virginia Boyle Vice President, System Operations Services Air Traffic Organization and emailed by Angella Martin-Osorio.\r\n\r\nSome alleged laws have been included regarding the redacted information:\r\n1.  Section 242 of Title 18 \r\n2.  Privacy Act of 1974 \r\n3.  The Posse Comitatus Act\r\n4.  The Insurrection Act of 1807 \r\n5.  18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1113\r\n6.  Redacted information does not coincide with the 16 different critical infrastructures\r\n7.  Additional information about laws and regulations have been provided via the attached appeal document.",

Therefore, it is not a current practice to collect and retain Qualified Contracts. To the best of our knowledge, before this requirement in the QAP, three requests for Qualified Contracts were made, and one request was pursued by the owner. Based on CHFA\u2019s record retention policy, that document is no longer on file with CHFA.\r\n\r\nThe list you requested is not an existing document, however, attached is the recorded termination agreement of the Land Use Restrictive Agreement (LURA) of the one development that pursued a Qualified Contract.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, please reach out to Matt Lynn, CHFA\u2019s media liaison, for any further assistance.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Schumacher\r\nStaff Attorney\r\nLegal and Risk Management\r\nColorado Housing and Finance Authority\r\n1981 Blake Street\r\nDenver, CO 80202\r\nwww.chfainfo.com<http://www.chfainfo.com/>\r\n303.297.7471 direct\r\n303.297.2432 main\r\n800.877.2432 toll free\r\n\r\nfinancing the places where people live and work\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clover Park School District received your public records request on November 5, 2021. Your request seeks all public records requests received by the District from January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021, as well as a complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s responses to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests since 2010 have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question, and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.     Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2.     Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3.     Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4.     The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the district, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing the first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by February 4, 2022. I have also submitted your request to our NextRequest Program on November 5, 2021, at 3:29 pm. This will also include our 5-day response from our District.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAranka Holmes\r\n\r\nCoordinator for Public Records, WC Claims, and ADA\r\n\r\n[cid:b525986e-eb5d-4ccc-9e3e-be0e3be9d7ee]\r\n\r\nCreating Promising Futures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Services Center\r\n\r\n10903 Gravelly Lake Dr SW, Lakewood WA  98499-1341\r\n\r\n253-583-5083 \u2022  Fax 253-583-5088\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail message and all attachments, if any, may contain confidential and privileged material and are intended only for the person or entity to which the message is addressed.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records.\u00a0See\u00a034 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records. See 34 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labeled PRA requests when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District would like you to clarify whether you are seeking those requests for records which would qualify as FERPA requests, or if you are purely seeking the records produced under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.

FERPA provides families certain rights with regard to their students\u2019 education records, including the ability to review and request their student\u2019s education records.\u00a0See\u00a034 C.F.R. 99.10. Because the District processes both PRA requests and FERPA requests through the same system, many requests by parents to view their student records have been labelled PRA requests, when in actuality, they were FERPA requests. This means many of the sets of records that appear to have been produced under the PRA were actually produced under FERPA. For example, the first installment to you of responsive records will include about eighty requests for records. Of those 80 requests, 30 sets of records were requested under FERPA, while the rest were requested under the PRA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the second installment of records. The information you requested is unable to be emailed due to size; however, we have copied the requested items onto a flash drive.
