We received DOI-OS-002552 on 9/14; DOI-OS-2020-005832 on 9/22; DOI-OS-2020-005857 and DOI-OS-2020-005859, on 9/23.\r\n\r\nOur regulations require that your FOIA requests contain sufficient information for us to determine your proper fee category.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.38(a).  Your requests do not fulfill this requirement because \u200bthey do not indicate whether you are commercial, educational/non-commercial scientific, media or other type of requester \u200bas your interest in requested information will affect if any fees will be assessed.  We therefore are unable to process your four requests at this time.  If you wish to pursue your requests, please provide us with more information that will further explain your fee category.\r\n\r\n\u200bOnce the fee category is resolved, additional information\u200b is needed on  \u200bthe following requests:\r\nFor DOI-OS-2020-002552, \u200bthe scope is unclear and additional information is needed. FOIA requires that requests describe the records sought with sufficient detail to allow an agency employee familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.  Your request does not adequately describe the records sought.  Please provide more information, such who/which office you would like searched, where you would like us to search, etc.\r\n\r\nFor DOI-OS-2020-005832, there \u200bis no attachment, we are \u200bunable to identify the subject of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact our office by email at osfoia@ios.doi.gov,<mailto:osfoia@ios.doi.gov,> through FOIA Online, by phone at (202) 513-0765, by fax at (202) 219-2374, or by mail at U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C St, N.W., MS-7328 MIB, Washington, D.C. 20240.

Fieldnotes qualifies as a news media organization under the definition provided by Congress in the OPEN Government Act because it \u201cgathers information of potential interest to a large segment of the public, and uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.\u201d\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Fieldnotes is seeking this FOIA request because the information in it is of interest to a large portion of the public, including the many concerned citizens that regularly acquire information through our extensive range of publications. These publications include websites, blogs, newsletters, reports, press statements, social media networks such as Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Fieldnotes reaches out to many traditional news media outlets that regularly broadcast our publications through television, radio, print and electronic articles and interviews.\r\n\r\nFieldnotes plans to compile the information from this request into a distinct, original work that will be released to the public through the publications listed above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nColette Rosenberg\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdepartment-of-insurance-8737%252Ftemple-landrytarget-comms-174059%252F%253Femail%253Dtgarner%252540ldi.la.gov&url_auth_token=AAADtlOPMU6_M9A6FRWpxjDltqk%3A1sxdA6%3ANhFHCGxiS1fFivXq8ymizNGjD9dsR9m5LUu0k0uqbfs \r\n\r\nYou'll receive an email when your request has been completed.

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with the RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file a RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Cmmw. 2012). As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a Right-to-Know\u00a0Request pursuant to the RTKL and will process it as an informal request.  You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request. Please note that if you resubmit your request as a written request pursuant to the RTKL, the City will deem your informal request to have been withdrawn.\u00a0  The City\u2019s Open Records Policy can be found here:\u00a0  https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/   The statewide form appears at the end of the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. If you require a hard copy of the form and/or policy, please let me know and one will be provided.  The City reserves the right to assert any and all grounds of denial in its final response to your request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll records, documents, or communications relating to Dr. Morris Joseph Starsky (February 1, 1933 \u2013 January 20, 1989). Dr. Starsky was a professor of philosophy at Arizona State University (ASU) from 1964 until 1970, when he was fired by ASU for participating in a civil rights protest. Concurrent to this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was surveilling Dr. Starsky as part of COINTELPRO. Dr. Starsky successfully petitioned the FBI to release documents related this surveillance campaign as part of a Freedom of Information Act request in 1974. I am requesting all documents previously released to Dr. Starsky at that time and any subsequent records, documents, or communications the FBI may have produced concerning Dr. Starsky. There is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Starsky's privacy as he previously made these documents public; additionally, Dr. Starsky passed away on January 20, 1989. A  copy of his obituary from the January 22, 1989 edition of The Arizona Republic is attached.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I have previously written for Philly Voice and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.

Dr. Starsky was a professor\r\n    of philosophy at Arizona State University (ASU) from 1964 until 1970, when\r\n    he was fired by ASU for participating in a civil rights protest. Concurrent\r\n    to this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was surveilling Dr.\r\n    Starsky as part of COINTELPRO. Dr. Starsky successfully petitioned the FBI\r\n    to release documents related this surveillance campaign as part of a Freedom\r\n    of Information Act request in 1974. I am requesting all documents previously\r\n    released to Dr. Starsky at that time and any subsequent records, documents,\r\n    or communications the FBI may have produced concerning Dr. Starsky. There is\r\n    no expectation of a violation of Dr. Starsky's privacy as he previously made\r\n    these documents public; additionally, Dr. Starsky passed away on January 20,\r\n    1989.

No circumstances have changed on my end, and I am still very much interested in obtaining these records.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to renew my request for a fee waiver. My bylines include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your guidance through the FOIPA process.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

Your request mentioned: To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAccess to public records related to the collaboration between Fullerton College, the Fullerton Police Department (FPD), and Flying Lion, Inc. concerning the FPD\u2019s Drone First Responder (DFR) trial program. \r\n\r\nThis request is prompted by a law enforcement bulletin obtained from the Fullerton Police Department through a separate PRA request, which indicates that Fullerton College collaborated with the FPD on the DFR program. The bulletin specifically mentions that this collaboration led to the use of the call sign \"Hornets\" in honor of the Fullerton College Hornets. A copy of this bulletin is enclosed for your reference. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting the following records: \r\n\r\n1. All communications (including but not limited to emails, letters, memos, and meeting minutes) between Fullerton College and the Fullerton Police Department related to the DFR program, including any discussion of the use of the call sign \"Hornets.\" \r\n\r\n2. Agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding between Fullerton College and the Fullerton Police Department and/or Flying Lion, Inc. pertaining to the DFR trial program. \r\n\r\n3. Any documents, reports, or presentations prepared by Fullerton College for or in collaboration with the Fullerton Police Department and/or Flying Lion, Inc. regarding the DFR program. \r\n\r\n4. Any internal communications or documents within Fullerton College that discuss or reference the college\u2019s involvement in or support for the FPD\u2019s DFR program. \r\n\r\nIf any records are withheld, please provide a detailed justification for each withheld record or portion thereof, including the specific exemption that you believe justifies the withholding. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

In accordance with section 7922.000 of the California Public Records Act, if you claim that any portion of any record is exempt, please redact that portion of the record that you believe is exempt and provide both the statutory citation to any exemption you believe is applicable and the specific reasons for your conclusion that the redacted portion of the record is exempt from disclosure and produce the remainder of the record(s). If you claim that any of the requested records are not a public record, or you claim a privilege not to disclose any record, please respond by identifying any such records and explaining your claim that it is not a public record or why it is privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt, in accordance with section 7922.000. Please produce all records for which you do not claim an exemption or privilege. The California Public Records Act requires determination of whether these records may be disclosed, and specific reasons why any material requested, or portions thereof, are exempt from disclosure, within ten days from receipt of this request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code section 7922.535. It also requires that you notify us of this determination and of the estimated date and time when the records will be produced. See id.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnonymous Anon",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

(\u201cOPRA\u201d) which you sent via electronic mail on September 6, 2024, and was received by the Eastern Camden School District (\u201cBoard\u201d) on September 9, 2024. The deadline to respond to your OPRA request is September 18, 2024. This response is being provided to you in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOPRA defines a \u201cgovernment record\u201d of a public entity as \u201cany paper, written or printed book, document, drawing, map, plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document, information stored or maintained electronically or by sound-recording or in a similar device, or any copy thereof, that has been made, maintained or kept on file in the course of its official business \u2026\u201d. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. Accordingly, the Board is required to produce only those records which it maintains in the official course of business. Pursuant to the definition of a government record, a public entity is not required by OPRA to research information and/or create records that do not exist in response to OPRA requests. See e.g., Mag Entertainment, LLC v. Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 375 N.J. Super 537 (App. Div. March 2005). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request and the Board\u2019s response to the same is as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nREQUEST: Any communications to or from Superintendent Cloutier concerning the walkout at Eastern High School referenced in the April 22, 2024 letter from Camden County Commissioners Jeff Nash and Melinda Kane. These communications include (but are not limited to) any communications referencing the words \"walkout,\" \"walk out,\" \"protest,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Gaza,\" \"anti-semitism,\" \"anti-semitic,\" \"antisemitism,\" \"antisemitic,\" \"Jews,\" or \"Jewish.\" This request is limited to April 1, 2024 to May 15, 2024. This request satisfies N.J. Stat. \u00a7 47:1A-5(g)'s requirement that the request identify the specific job title, subject matter, and reasonable time period. Any communications to or from the principal or vice principals referenced by Superintendent Cloutier\u2019s statement which concern the walkout, any public or private response to the planned walkout, or the walkout\u2019s cancellation. These communications include (but are not limited to) any communications referencing the words \"walkout,\" \"walk out,\" \"protest,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Gaza,\" \"anti-semitism,\" \"anti-semitic,\" \"antisemitism,\" \"antisemitic,\" \"Jews,\" or \"Jewish.\" This request is limited to April 1, 2024 to May 15, 2024. This request satisfies N.J. Stat. \u00a7 47:1A-5(g)'s requirement that the request identify the specific job title, subject matter, and reasonable time period.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRESPONSE: The Board objects to and denies the request as it does not include the form components as set forth in subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c404 (C.47:1A-5). Specifically, the request does not include the required certification whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose. Please note that the Board has adopted the new OPRA request form on its website https://www.eccrsd.us/. Please note that on June 5, 2024, Governor Murphy signed Bill 2930 into law which requires the request be submitted by the requestor in the form adopted by the custodian and the custodian may deny a request that is not submitted in a form adopted by the custodian. The law also notes that the form shall include space for a requestor to certify whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. Specifically, commercial purpose means \u201cthe direct or indirect use of any part of government record for sale, resale, solicitation, rent or lease of a service, or any use by which the user expects to profit either through commission, salary, or fee.\u201d Moreover, all requests by a data broker shall be denied. Data broker is defined as \u201ca business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.\u201d Sanctions may be imposed against individuals and entities that violate these rules. A requestor who is found to have sold the data obtained by a records request, who is found to have intentionally failed to certify the records request is for a commercial purpose, who is a data broker, or who was making the request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker, and if found to have intentionally certified that the requestor is not a data broker or is not making a request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker, shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for the first offense, $2,500 for the second offense, and $5000 for each subsequent offense. The penalties may be imposed by the courts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf your request for access to a government record has been denied or unfilled within the seven (7) business days required by law, you have a right to challenge the decision by the District to deny access. At your option, you may either institute a proceeding in the Superior Court of New Jersey or file a complaint with the Government Records Council (GRC) by completing the Denial of Access Complaint Form.  You may contact the GRC by toll-free telephone at 866-850-0511, by mail at P.O. Box 819, Trenton, NJ 08625, or by e-mail at grc@dca.state.nj.us, or at their website at www.state.nj.us/grc. The GRC can also answer other questions about the law. All questions regarding complaints filed in Superior Court should be directed to the Court Clerk in your County.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKen Verrill, SBA\r\n\r\nBusiness Administrator/Records Custodian\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBegin forwarded message:\n",

This FOIA was done in a polling fashion and FOIA Analysts of other agencies have not made the same error and if required, requested clarification.\r\nQuoting the original request:\r\nI was seeking any records in your custody in relation to potential threats of assassination to the Former Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe for the dates: 01/01/2022 to the current date. \r\nI was also seeking any records in your custody related to the Former Prime Minister based on the announcement of his untimely murder. \r\nIn the interest of intellectual discourse and brevity I refuse to further highlight the additional laws cited for appeal as this information is \u2018inter-alia\u2019.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n/s/\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, job title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, parish, hire date, termination date, civil service status, annual salary, and gross wages. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\nIn response to your February 13, 2024 public records request, the Division of Administration has concluded its search for records. Please be aware of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7        The information requested has been provided in quarterly reports. However, quarterly reports for the years 2020 \u2013 2022 are not available.\r\n\r\n  *   The information provided is for employees of executive branch agencies paid through the LaGov HCM payroll system. This does not include higher education or agencies in the legislative and judicial branches of government.\r\n  *   The information reported is for employees active on the last day of each quarter.\r\n  *   Gross wages and overtime are only provided for the fourth quarter of each year.\r\n  *   Overtime spreadsheets include every employee who received overtime pay at any point during the respective calendar year.  Overtime reported is overtime that is paid as worked and it is included in the gross wages.  An explanation of the wage types can be found below.\r\n  *   The agency hire date is optional for entry in the LaGov HCM payroll system and the use may vary by agency.  As such, this date may not exist for some employees.  We cannot confirm the accuracy of this date (if populated) and we cannot confirm it reflects the employee\u2019s first date of state service.\r\n  *   The Personnel Area Reference worksheet contains a mapping of agency number to agency name. The first three (3) characters in the name represent the department.\r\n  *   The ZX01 worksheets contain columns for the racial categories.  This cell will reflect a value of \u201c1\u201d for the specified race.  An explanation of the column headings can be found below.\r\n  *   Work addresses are not stored in the LaGov HCM system; work parish, if specified, is provided instead.\r\n\r\nExplanation of overtime wage types:\r\n\r\n  *   OT (ST) Attendance = Hour for hour overtime paid\r\n  *   OT(1.5) Attendance = Straight rate overtime paid\r\n  *   OT(1.5) Att - NE Prem = 0.5 rate piece of overtime paid which includes the FLSA calculation\r\n\r\nExplanation of racial categories:\r\n\r\n  *   Decl = Declined to State\r\n  *   Ind/AK = American Indian or Alaskan Native\r\n  *   Asian = Asian\r\n  *   AfrAm = Black or African American\r\n  *   HI/PI = Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\r\n\r\n\u00b7        White = White\r\n\r\nThe below Dropbox link contains the records responsive to your request. You do not need a Dropbox account to view and download the documents. This link will expire after 30 days. Please note that any inadvertent production of records which are exempt from production under the Public Records Law does not constitute a waiver of this exemption.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/7bdajni7koucvspprcj1f/ABVEi3L4ANGxANaRo24Prkc?rlkey=emijmbhqyjeccrha3iartf7b1&st=5cbuu7ix&dl=0\r\n\r\nThe Division considers your request satisfied with this response.
