I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll records, documents, or communications relating to Dr. Morris Joseph Starsky (February 1, 1933 \u2013 January 20, 1989). Dr. Starsky was a professor of philosophy at Arizona State University (ASU) from 1964 until 1970, when he was fired by ASU for participating in a civil rights protest. Concurrent to this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was surveilling Dr. Starsky as part of COINTELPRO. Dr. Starsky successfully petitioned the FBI to release documents related this surveillance campaign as part of a Freedom of Information Act request in 1974. I am requesting all documents previously released to Dr. Starsky at that time and any subsequent records, documents, or communications the FBI may have produced concerning Dr. Starsky. There is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Starsky's privacy as he previously made these documents public; additionally, Dr. Starsky passed away on January 20, 1989. A  copy of his obituary from the January 22, 1989 edition of The Arizona Republic is attached.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I have previously written for Philly Voice and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

Your request mentioned: To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAccess to public records related to the collaboration between Fullerton College, the Fullerton Police Department (FPD), and Flying Lion, Inc. concerning the FPD\u2019s Drone First Responder (DFR) trial program. \r\n\r\nThis request is prompted by a law enforcement bulletin obtained from the Fullerton Police Department through a separate PRA request, which indicates that Fullerton College collaborated with the FPD on the DFR program. The bulletin specifically mentions that this collaboration led to the use of the call sign \"Hornets\" in honor of the Fullerton College Hornets. A copy of this bulletin is enclosed for your reference. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting the following records: \r\n\r\n1. All communications (including but not limited to emails, letters, memos, and meeting minutes) between Fullerton College and the Fullerton Police Department related to the DFR program, including any discussion of the use of the call sign \"Hornets.\" \r\n\r\n2. Agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding between Fullerton College and the Fullerton Police Department and/or Flying Lion, Inc. pertaining to the DFR trial program. \r\n\r\n3. Any documents, reports, or presentations prepared by Fullerton College for or in collaboration with the Fullerton Police Department and/or Flying Lion, Inc. regarding the DFR program. \r\n\r\n4. Any internal communications or documents within Fullerton College that discuss or reference the college\u2019s involvement in or support for the FPD\u2019s DFR program. \r\n\r\nIf any records are withheld, please provide a detailed justification for each withheld record or portion thereof, including the specific exemption that you believe justifies the withholding. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAndrew Johnston \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnorth-orange-county-community-college-district-35901%252Ffullerton-college-and-fullerton-police-department-dfr-program-173948%252F%253Femail%253Dkstearns%252540nocccd.edu&url_auth_token=AAGzh1ND4Gju0NG7RjeCek_vrHg%3A1svZ7m%3AEVsrDld0z-RUjiSecIuS9JXd5e1x0oekVEvSlUcO0Vg The North Orange County Community College District has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.

In accordance with section 7922.000 of the California Public Records Act, if you claim that any portion of any record is exempt, please redact that portion of the record that you believe is exempt and provide both the statutory citation to any exemption you believe is applicable and the specific reasons for your conclusion that the redacted portion of the record is exempt from disclosure and produce the remainder of the record(s). If you claim that any of the requested records are not a public record, or you claim a privilege not to disclose any record, please respond by identifying any such records and explaining your claim that it is not a public record or why it is privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt, in accordance with section 7922.000. Please produce all records for which you do not claim an exemption or privilege. The California Public Records Act requires determination of whether these records may be disclosed, and specific reasons why any material requested, or portions thereof, are exempt from disclosure, within ten days from receipt of this request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code section 7922.535. It also requires that you notify us of this determination and of the estimated date and time when the records will be produced. See id.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnonymous Anon",

The Court does not have a report that identifies every granted or denied order made by individual judicial officers.  Attached please find a report for denials for mental health diversion cases.  While the judicial officer is not listed on the data output, you can come to the courthouse to view the case files to verify the judicial officer who made the denial order.  Please note that case names were redacted under California Rules of Court, rule 10.500(f)(5) because public disclosure of this information is prohibited under Penal Code sections 13300\u201313302.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJessica Kellogg, MPP (pronouns she/her)\r\n\r\nCommunications Program Manager\r\n\r\nSuperior Court of California, County of Santa Clara\r\n(408) 334-9236 | jkellogg@scscourt.org<mailto:jkellogg@scscourt.org>\n",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

(\u201cOPRA\u201d) which you sent via electronic mail on September 6, 2024, and was received by the Eastern Camden School District (\u201cBoard\u201d) on September 9, 2024. The deadline to respond to your OPRA request is September 18, 2024. This response is being provided to you in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOPRA defines a \u201cgovernment record\u201d of a public entity as \u201cany paper, written or printed book, document, drawing, map, plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document, information stored or maintained electronically or by sound-recording or in a similar device, or any copy thereof, that has been made, maintained or kept on file in the course of its official business \u2026\u201d. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. Accordingly, the Board is required to produce only those records which it maintains in the official course of business. Pursuant to the definition of a government record, a public entity is not required by OPRA to research information and/or create records that do not exist in response to OPRA requests. See e.g., Mag Entertainment, LLC v. Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 375 N.J. Super 537 (App. Div. March 2005). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request and the Board\u2019s response to the same is as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nREQUEST: Any communications to or from Superintendent Cloutier concerning the walkout at Eastern High School referenced in the April 22, 2024 letter from Camden County Commissioners Jeff Nash and Melinda Kane. These communications include (but are not limited to) any communications referencing the words \"walkout,\" \"walk out,\" \"protest,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Gaza,\" \"anti-semitism,\" \"anti-semitic,\" \"antisemitism,\" \"antisemitic,\" \"Jews,\" or \"Jewish.\" This request is limited to April 1, 2024 to May 15, 2024. This request satisfies N.J. Stat. \u00a7 47:1A-5(g)'s requirement that the request identify the specific job title, subject matter, and reasonable time period. Any communications to or from the principal or vice principals referenced by Superintendent Cloutier\u2019s statement which concern the walkout, any public or private response to the planned walkout, or the walkout\u2019s cancellation. These communications include (but are not limited to) any communications referencing the words \"walkout,\" \"walk out,\" \"protest,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Gaza,\" \"anti-semitism,\" \"anti-semitic,\" \"antisemitism,\" \"antisemitic,\" \"Jews,\" or \"Jewish.\" This request is limited to April 1, 2024 to May 15, 2024. This request satisfies N.J. Stat. \u00a7 47:1A-5(g)'s requirement that the request identify the specific job title, subject matter, and reasonable time period.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRESPONSE: The Board objects to and denies the request as it does not include the form components as set forth in subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c404 (C.47:1A-5). Specifically, the request does not include the required certification whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose. Please note that the Board has adopted the new OPRA request form on its website https://www.eccrsd.us/. Please note that on June 5, 2024, Governor Murphy signed Bill 2930 into law which requires the request be submitted by the requestor in the form adopted by the custodian and the custodian may deny a request that is not submitted in a form adopted by the custodian. The law also notes that the form shall include space for a requestor to certify whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. Specifically, commercial purpose means \u201cthe direct or indirect use of any part of government record for sale, resale, solicitation, rent or lease of a service, or any use by which the user expects to profit either through commission, salary, or fee.\u201d Moreover, all requests by a data broker shall be denied. Data broker is defined as \u201ca business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.\u201d Sanctions may be imposed against individuals and entities that violate these rules. A requestor who is found to have sold the data obtained by a records request, who is found to have intentionally failed to certify the records request is for a commercial purpose, who is a data broker, or who was making the request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker, and if found to have intentionally certified that the requestor is not a data broker or is not making a request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker, shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for the first offense, $2,500 for the second offense, and $5000 for each subsequent offense. The penalties may be imposed by the courts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf your request for access to a government record has been denied or unfilled within the seven (7) business days required by law, you have a right to challenge the decision by the District to deny access. At your option, you may either institute a proceeding in the Superior Court of New Jersey or file a complaint with the Government Records Council (GRC) by completing the Denial of Access Complaint Form.  You may contact the GRC by toll-free telephone at 866-850-0511, by mail at P.O. Box 819, Trenton, NJ 08625, or by e-mail at grc@dca.state.nj.us, or at their website at www.state.nj.us/grc. The GRC can also answer other questions about the law. All questions regarding complaints filed in Superior Court should be directed to the Court Clerk in your County.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKen Verrill, SBA\r\n\r\nBusiness Administrator/Records Custodian\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBegin forwarded message:\n",

The online portal allows users to track\r\nthe status of their request and enables greater transparency and enhanced\r\ncommunication with the department. Links to our portal can be found on our\r\nwebsite, www.dhs.maryland.gov. The direct link is:\r\nhttps://marylanddhs.nextrequest.com/\r\n\r\nI will manually log your request in our portal shortly, and you will\r\nreceive an auto-email confirmation once it's ready for inspection. Please\r\nsend any follow up communications via the portal.

This FOIA was done in a polling fashion and FOIA Analysts of other agencies have not made the same error and if required, requested clarification.\r\nQuoting the original request:\r\nI was seeking any records in your custody in relation to potential threats of assassination to the Former Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe for the dates: 01/01/2022 to the current date. \r\nI was also seeking any records in your custody related to the Former Prime Minister based on the announcement of his untimely murder. \r\nIn the interest of intellectual discourse and brevity I refuse to further highlight the additional laws cited for appeal as this information is \u2018inter-alia\u2019.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n/s/\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, job title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, parish, hire date, termination date, civil service status, annual salary, and gross wages. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please be aware of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7        The information requested has been provided in quarterly reports. However, quarterly reports for the years 2020 \u2013 2022 are not available.\r\n\r\n  *   The information provided is for employees of executive branch agencies paid through the LaGov HCM payroll system. This does not include higher education or agencies in the legislative and judicial branches of government.\r\n  *   The information reported is for employees active on the last day of each quarter.\r\n  *   Gross wages and overtime are only provided for the fourth quarter of each year.\r\n  *   Overtime spreadsheets include every employee who received overtime pay at any point during the respective calendar year.  Overtime reported is overtime that is paid as worked and it is included in the gross wages.  An explanation of the wage types can be found below.\r\n  *   The agency hire date is optional for entry in the LaGov HCM payroll system and the use may vary by agency.  As such, this date may not exist for some employees.  We cannot confirm the accuracy of this date (if populated) and we cannot confirm it reflects the employee\u2019s first date of state service.\r\n  *   The Personnel Area Reference worksheet contains a mapping of agency number to agency name. The first three (3) characters in the name represent the department.\r\n  *   The ZX01 worksheets contain columns for the racial categories.  This cell will reflect a value of \u201c1\u201d for the specified race.  An explanation of the column headings can be found below.\r\n  *   Work addresses are not stored in the LaGov HCM system; work parish, if specified, is provided instead.\r\n\r\nExplanation of overtime wage types:\r\n\r\n  *   OT (ST) Attendance = Hour for hour overtime paid\r\n  *   OT(1.5) Attendance = Straight rate overtime paid\r\n  *   OT(1.5) Att - NE Prem = 0.5 rate piece of overtime paid which includes the FLSA calculation\r\n\r\nExplanation of racial categories:\r\n\r\n  *   Decl = Declined to State\r\n  *   Ind/AK = American Indian or Alaskan Native\r\n  *   Asian = Asian\r\n  *   AfrAm = Black or African American\r\n  *   HI/PI = Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\r\n\r\n\u00b7        White = White\r\n\r\nThe below Dropbox link contains the records responsive to your request. You do not need a Dropbox account to view and download the documents. This link will expire after 30 days. Please note that any inadvertent production of records which are exempt from production under the Public Records Law does not constitute a waiver of this exemption.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/7bdajni7koucvspprcj1f/ABVEi3L4ANGxANaRo24Prkc?rlkey=emijmbhqyjeccrha3iartf7b1&st=5cbuu7ix&dl=0\r\n\r\nThe Division considers your request satisfied with this response.

Digital copies of any/all invoices or bills for any/all legal services or legal representation provided to your AGENCY, your AGENCY BOARD OF DIRECTORS, and/or AGENCY employees or representatives.\r\n\r\n2. Digital copies of any/all payments made by your AGENCY for any/all legal services provided to the AGENCY or AGENCY employees or AGENCY representatives.\r\n\r\n3. Digital copies of any/all emails, texts, and/or communications of any kind regarding legal invoices and/or payment for legal services of any kind made by your AGENCY.\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE\r\n\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2020 to June 24, 2024.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION \u2013 REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF TIME\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a \u201creasonable\u201d estimate of time your agency intends to produce a first installment of records as per WAC 44-14-04003 (7) and RCW 42.56.520(1)(c). This time estimate should be an actual date such as May 31, 2024 rather than an undefined block of time in the future such as \u201cwithin the next six months.\u201d (Hikel v. City of Lynnwood, Dec. 27, 2016)\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf/ .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

This is a total fee estimate for this public records request of $16.\r\n\r\nA 10% deposit for the estimated charges is required before further work on this request commences. Please mail a check for at least $1.60 to KCDA, or schedule a time to come pay cash in person: 18639 80th Ave S. Kent WA, 98032 during regular business hours.

All responsive records are available here:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1jC5-Ke9_jn2gdGXod30IyS00oWgokgC2/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThe actual cost of records production was $10.16.\r\n\r\nPer KCDA\u2019 s Public Records Act Policy and Procedure and RCW 42.56.120, the costs for producing copies of records include the following:\r\n\r\nCost for Electronic Records\r\nTen cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of KCDA equipment to scan the records; Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery; Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of KCDA equipment to send the records electronically; and The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by KCDA, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nYour request produced 87 pages of hard-copy records which need to be scanned to produce electronically, resulting in copying costs of $8.70. There are also 117 originally-digital electronic files to be provided electronically, resulting in copying costs of $ 1.46. The data delivery file of 0.052321 gigabytes has negligible fees. The total cost of this records request is $10.16\r\n\r\n You paid $16 as the estimated cost of which $5.84 is due back to you, where would you like your refund check sent and whom should it be made out too? \r\n\r\nThis completes KCDA\u2019s response to your request dated June 24, 2024. KCDA has closed your request and no additional records will be produced in response to this request. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been completely fulfilled is in error or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 |",

Any record submitted to DHS HQ (including Congressional Affairs, Management & Analysis, and the Secretary and appropriate under-Secretary\u2019s offices, DHS FOIA) by DHS agency subcomponents CBP, OIG, ICE, and USCIS that seek or justify requests for additional appropriated funds from Congress or in the Presidential budget proposal to help these subcomponents\u2019 FOIA offices clear their backlogs, shorten processing times, process and release more records, and avoid costly FOIA litigation. Please task a search for the budget cycles covering fiscal years (FY) 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. \r\n\r\n2. Any record showing requested budget increases for DHS, ICE, CBP, OIG or USCIS FOIA offices that were not fulfilled by Congress in the appropriations legislation for FY19-22. \r\n\r\n3. Any record showing the amount of additional appropriated funds estimated to be necessary to reduce the current backlogs, shorten processing times, and avoid costly litigation involving FOIA processing by CBP, ICE, OIG, DHS, and USCIS during FY19-23. \r\n\r\n4. Any record of DHS acknowledging, approving, or directing its agency subcomponents\u2019 FOIA offices (ICE, OIG, CBP, USCIS, or DHS) to \u201cprocess\u201d only  500 pages of records per month in litigation.\r\n\r\n5. Any record showing DHS agency subcomponents\u2019 FOIA Office determinations that they  lack adequate resources to fulfill their statutory timing obligations were communicated by those agencies to DHS leadership and budgeting personnel. The subcomponents to be queried are iCE, CBP, OIG, USCIS, and DHS HQ.  Please query FY19-23.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

I further appeal  the agency\u2019s failure to categorize this \u201ctoo-broad\u201d determination as a denial and notify me of my right to appeal. And I appeal the agency\u2019s failure to task an adequate search in response to this request. \r\n\r\n6 CFR Section 5.3(b) provides: \r\n\r\n(b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DHS personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-random search for the record based on the component's filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Requesters should refer to appendix I of this subpart for additional component-specific requirements. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component's FOIA Officer or FOIA public liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request, a component determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component should inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the DHS Privacy Office, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought.\r\n\r\nI am searching in vain to find any contact information you provided in your April 22, 2022, that would allow me, as a requestor, to \u201cdiscuss [my] request with the component\u2019s designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the DHS FOIA Privacy Office, each of whom is available to assist [me] in reasonably describing the records sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nDHS has offered no contact information in this letter for its Designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a \u201crepresentative of the DHS FOIA Privacy Office,\u201d and as such, none of them are \u201cavailable to assist\u201d as your own regulations require. \r\n\r\nPlease promptly remand this appeal with instructions to comply with the Department\u2019s own FOIA regulations and the Act. \r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBureau records related to a cartoonist and web designer named Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Richards (born October 20th, 1946 - died April 21st, 2023) was a cartoonist in the 1960s and 70s. His work was frequently featured in publications such as The Berkeley Tribe. His death was widely reported, and a news report regarding his passing should be attached, and can be viewed at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2023/04/24/ted-richards-rip/\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the Cartoonist Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a thorough search for any records on Richards held by the Cincinnati, San Francisco and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Please note, there appears to have been a previous FOIA request with the bureau for records related to The Berkeley Tribe (FOIA: 1394913-0). Much of that file, which is currently accessible on the Internet Archive, appears to be heavily redacted. Please re-examine The Berkeley Tribe release in relation to the release of documents related to Theodore Richards. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the work that the bureau does, and for the bureau's commitment to transparency. I look forward to the resolution of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Your request for is considered impermissibly broad and does not comply with the FOIA's requirement that requests for records reasonably describe the records you are seeking. Your request, as written, would not allow professional agency employees familiar with the subject area to locate the records with a \u201creasonable amount of effort.\u201d  It is the requester\u2019s responsibility to identify the records they seek, and the records must be described in a manner that enables our record holders to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. Therefore, it is most helpful to us if a requester provides very specific, descriptive information about the records they seek. All of the records related to a Corps project are not maintained in a single file or location. Each office/department maintains its own records based on the issues or matters for which it is involved.  Additionally, present archival systems do not allow us to ensure an adequate search for records using such broad criteria. Therefore, for us to locate all \"every letter Jennifer Gonzalez Colon or her office has sent to USACE's Jacksonville District\" as instructed in your request, we would have to request that every employee within the Jacksonville District search all of their electronic and hard copy records located within their purview to see if they have records that relate in any way possible to your request. This type of extensive search would involve many employees and would involve many hours of search time.  Please provide more specific information so that a reasonable search for records can be done.  Our office will not be able to assist you with your request until you narrow the scope of what you are seeking.\r\n\r\nWe will keep this matter in a pending status, but if we don't receive an amended request by August 8, 2024, we will close the file and take no further action.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nFOIA ADMINISTRATOR\r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District\r\n701 San Marco Blvd.\r\nJacksonville, FL 32207-8175\r\nph:  904-232-2477\r\n\r\nATTENTION:  PLEASE CONTACT OUR OFFICE DIRECTLY BY E-MAIL AT FOIA-SAJ@USACE.ARMY.MIL WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. TO ENSURE YOUR REQUEST IS RECEIVED AND PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FOIA REQUESTS BE E-MAILED TO OUR OFFICE AT FOIA-SAJ@USACE.ARMY.MIL.\n",
