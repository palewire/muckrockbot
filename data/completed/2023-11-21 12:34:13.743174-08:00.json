        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

It has been over six months since my initial request, and the RAO's response only included a single email thread with one edge case that does not reflect the scope of my original request. I believe that this information is critical to my request, and I kindly request that the RAO conduct a thorough search for any and all responsive records related to this matter.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the RAO in the current case has cited a high volume of FOIL requests as one of the reasons for the delay in responding to the request. While this may be a legitimate factor, it is also important for agencies to have adequate staffing and resources to handle FOIL requests in a timely manner. I respectfully request that the RAO make every effort to provide a comprehensive response without further delay.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I noticed that some of the records provided have been redacted or withheld under New York State Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(b) and \u00a787(2)(g). While I understand that certain information may be exempt from disclosure, I request that the RAO provide a more detailed explanation as to why these records were withheld and what specific information was redacted.

Please include materials relating to the security procedures and requirements, as well as copies of the technical specifications for the machines involved. As an alternative to technical specifications, if the Bureau finds this too burdensome, model and serial numbers will suffice.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written about the government and its activities. I have a\r\n    reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills\r\n    are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make\r\n    them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and\r\n    MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not\r\n    limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the\r\n    activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not\r\n    necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not\r\n    required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126\r\n    (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15\r\n    (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as\r\n    well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the\r\n    request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7\r\n    552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative\r\n    of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for\r\n    which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by\r\n    reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be\r\n    waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records relating to or mentioning the process, procedure, limitations and\r\n    requirements (time, financial, security) of transferring FOIA documents to\r\n    electronic mediums, including but not limited to CDs, DVDs, the electronic\r\n    reading room, and the eFOIA portal, for release and distribution. Please\r\n    include materials relating to the security procedures and requirements, as\r\n    well as copies of the technical specifications for the machines involved. As\r\n    an alternative to technical specifications, if the Bureau finds this too\r\n    burdensome, model and serial numbers will suffice.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma Best\n",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nOn Friday, February 1, 2019 Nora Phillips, an American civil rights icon and vocal critic of the ongoing mistreatment of refugees,  was apprehended by Mexican authorities while traveling to vacation in Mexico and told a flag had been placed on her passport. As a result, she was detained for a series of hours with her 7-year-old daughter and then deported to the United States. Nora Phillips is a vocal migrant-rights advocate who has previously sued the United States government for human rights abuses. Three others were similarly excluded under identical circumstances: attorney Erika Pinheiro and journalists Kitra Cahana Daniel Ochoa.\r\n\r\nAs reported on February 1, 2019 in the Los Angeles Times here (https://www.latimes.com/la-me-immigration-attorneys-detained-20190202-story.html), these efforts appear to be a coordinated attack on immigration attorneys who advocate for the rights of refugees and journalists who dare to cover the refugee crisis on the border between the United States and Mexico.  According to the LA Times story, at least one of those individuals was told the flag was placed there by the United States, and given the circumstances it appears retaliatory. \r\n\r\nTo try to understand fully what is happening and, more importantly, report on the ongoing threat against journalist and migrant-rights advocates during what the President of the United States has described as a crisis on the border, I am requesting the following records: \r\n\r\n1. The list provided by the United States which led to Nora, Erika, Kitra, and Daniel having their passports flagged. \r\n2. The e-mail messages from any employee of the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Public affairs between the dates of January 15, 2019 and February 2, 2019 mentioning any of the following terms: (1) \"Nora Phillips\" \r\n\"Pinheiro\"\r\n\"Cahana\" \r\n\"Daniel Ochoa\"\r\n\"Remain in Mexico\"\r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security are on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government to target U.S. citizens, leading to unlawful arrest and deportation, apparently in retaliation for protected free speech. The disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been immediate outrage and media coverage of the deportation of Nora Phillips, including the LA Times story referenced above (https://www.latimes.com/la-me-immigration-attorneys-detained-20190202-story.html). This request seeks to uncover additional information about these arguably unconstitutional efforts by the United States federal government to retaliate against attorneys and journalists for protected speech. \r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched immigration and refugee issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I intend to use the results of this request to further my reporting on these subjects in American and international media. .\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited because of the emergent nature of the issue at stake and the danger facing individuals who unknowingly have been placed on the list. As an immigration attorney who intends to travel internationally in the coming months, I need to know as soon as possible if I am on the list. Further, to the extent the federal government appears to be engaged in an ongoing violation of the first amendment rights of immigration attorneys and journalists, the request meets the standard outlined at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1), and anything you can do to expedite the request would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security should expedite this request and produce the requested records at once.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Hoppock\n\n",

As the data was collected via electronic web form with separate entry fields, it\u2019s possible to extract the \"comment\" text by means of existing computer programs.\r\n\r\nI also asked that you provide the requested raw data in machine-readable form, such as a CSV or Excel file.\r\n\r\nPer my original request, the complete comments should be available under FOIL. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to The Committee on Open Government advisory opinion letter (FOIL-AO-19157). I've pasted relevant quotes from the letter below.\r\nHere is the link to the full advisory opinion letter: https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19157.html. I've also attached a PDF for your reference.\r\n\r\n\"if information is maintained in some physical form, it would constitute a \"record\" subject to rights of access conferred by the Law [Babigian v. Evans, 427 NYS 2d 688, 691 (1980); aff'd 97 AD 2d 992 (1983); see also, Szikszay v. Buelow, 436 NYS 2d 558 (1981)].\"\r\n\r\n\"Although an agency need not create new records to comply with FOIL, \u00a789(3)(a) states that, \u201cwhen an agency has the ability to retrieve or extract a record or data maintained in a computer storage system with reasonable effort, it shall be required to do so.\u201d  In that kind of situation, the agency would merely be retrieving data that it has the capacity to retrieve. Disclosure may be accomplished either by printing out the data on paper or perhaps by duplicating the data on another storage mechanism, such as a computer tape or disk. On the other hand, if information sought can be retrieved from a computer or other storage medium only by means of new programming or the alteration of existing programs, those steps would be the equivalent of creating a new record.\"\r\n\r\n\"We believe that there is a clear distinction between extracting information and creating it. If an agency's database consists of 10 items or \"fields\", and a request involves items 1, 3 and 5, but the agency has never produced that combination of data, would it be \"creating\" a new record? The answer is dependent on the nature of the agency's electronic information system. If the agency has the ability to retrieve or extract those items by means of its existing programs, i.e., entering queries, it would not be creating a new record; it would merely be retrieving what it has the ability to retrieve in conjunction with its electronic filing system. An apt analogy may be to a filing cabinet in which files are stored alphabetically and an applicant seeks items \"A\", \"L\" and \"X\". Although the agency may never have retrieved that combination of files in the past, it has the ability to do so, because the request was made in a manner applicable to the agency's filing system.\"\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for providing the records I originally requested, which should be available under FOIL.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDouglas Breitbart\r\nFOIL request 03398573",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI'm writing in response to the document you provided in response to my FOIL request (03398573).\r\n\r\nThank you for this document; however it appears to be a 1-page summary of customer comments for the Queens Bus Network Redesign.\r\n\r\nI had requested copies of ALL rider comments collected by the Metropolitan Transit Authority pertaining to the Queens Bus Network Redesign, submitted electronically via the project web page at the following URLs:\r\n\r\nhttps://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus (This was the original Queens Bus Network Redesign comment page which was later replaced with the URL below)\r\n\r\nhttps://contact.mta.info/s/forms/bus-network-redesign\r\n\r\nI specified that my request be limited to comments submitted between March 29, 2022 and August 31, 2022\r\n\r\nIn the interest of complying with the Freedom of Information Law\u2019s privacy requirements, I had asked that you limit this request to the \u201ccomment\u201d text only, withholding entries for name, address & contact information. As the data was collected via electronic web form with separate entry fields, it\u2019s possible to extract the \"comment\" text by means of existing computer programs.\r\n\r\nI also asked that you provide the requested raw data in machine-readable form, such as a CSV or Excel file.\r\n\r\nPer my original request, the complete comments should be available under FOIL.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to The Committee on Open Government advisory opinion letter (FOIL-AO-19157). I've pasted relevant quotes from the letter below.\r\nHere is the link to the full advisory opinion letter: https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19157.html. I've also attached a PDF for your reference.\r\n\r\n\"if information is maintained in some physical form, it would constitute a \"record\" subject to rights of access conferred by the Law [Babigian v. Evans, 427 NYS 2d 688, 691 (1980); aff'd 97 AD 2d 992 (1983); see also, Szikszay v. Buelow, 436 NYS 2d 558 (1981)].\"\r\n\r\n\"Although an agency need not create new records to comply with FOIL, \u00a789(3)(a) states that, \u201cwhen an agency has the ability to retrieve or extract a record or data maintained in a computer storage system with reasonable effort, it shall be required to do so.\u201d In that kind of situation, the agency would merely be retrieving data that it has the capacity to retrieve. Disclosure may be accomplished either by printing out the data on paper or perhaps by duplicating the data on another storage mechanism, such as a computer tape or disk. On the other hand, if information sought can be retrieved from a computer or other storage medium only by means of new programming or the alteration of existing programs, those steps would be the equivalent of creating a new record.\"\r\n\r\n\"We believe that there is a clear distinction between extracting information and creating it. If an agency's database consists of 10 items or \"fields\", and a request involves items 1, 3 and 5, but the agency has never produced that combination of data, would it be \"creating\" a new record? The answer is dependent on the nature of the agency's electronic information system. If the agency has the ability to retrieve or extract those items by means of its existing programs, i.e., entering queries, it would not be creating a new record; it would merely be retrieving what it has the ability to retrieve in conjunction with its electronic filing system. An apt analogy may be to a filing cabinet in which files are stored alphabetically and an applicant seeks items \"A\", \"L\" and \"X\". Although the agency may never have retrieved that combination of files in the past, it has the ability to do so, because the request was made in a manner applicable to the agency's filing system.\"\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for providing the records I originally requested, which should be available under FOIL.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDouglas Breitbart\r\nFOIL request 03398573",

No explanation was given for why the records I requested could not be produced, as is dictated by the MTA\u2019s legal obligations under the New York Freedom of Information Law. Consequently I consider the request to have been denied and I\u2019m appealing on that basis.\r\n\r\nMy FOIL request asked for the following records:\r\n- Copies of all rider comments collected by the Metropolitan Transit Authority pertaining to the Queens Bus Network Redesign, submitted electronically via the project web page at the following URLs:\r\nhttps://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus (This was the original Queens Bus Network Redesign comment page which was later replaced with the URL below)\r\nhttps://contact.mta.info/s/forms/bus-network-redesign\r\n- I limited my request to comments submitted between March 29, 2022 and August 31, 2022\r\n- In the interest of complying with the Freedom of Information Law\u2019s privacy requirements, I asked to limit the request to the \u201ccomment\u201d text only, withholding entries for name, address & contact information. As the data was collected via electronic web form with separate entry fields, it\u2019s possible to extract the \"comment\" text by means of existing computer programs.\r\n- I requested raw data in machine-readable form, such as a CSV or Excel file.\r\n- I explained that the documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n- In the event that there were fees, I asked to be informed of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n- I specified a preference that the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nIn response to my request, the MTA sent me the attached document (03398573-Responsive Record).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there is no legal basis for the MTA to deny my request. The records I requested were collected by the MTA via its own website, presumably stored on the agency\u2019s own computer systems, allowing for redaction of personal information to comply with privacy requirements. Please refer to the attached  Committee on Open Government advisory opinion letter (FOIL-AO-19157). It can also be viewed online at: https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19157.html. \r\n\r\nI've pasted relevant quotes from the attached advisory opinion letter below:\r\n\r\n\"if information is maintained in some physical form, it would constitute a \"record\" subject to rights of access conferred by the Law [Babigian v.

Please refer to these two FOIL requests for electronic records submitted online.\r\n\r\n- MTA FOIL Request #17695 submitted by J.K. Trotter via Muckrrock on December 3, 2013. This request asks the MTA to extract \u201cComments\u201d and claims text entries for lost or stolen Metrocards submitted to the Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019s Balance Protection Program MetroCard eFix website:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/mta-balanceprotection-comments-9399/\r\n\r\n- MTA FOIL Request #00066415 submitted by J.K. Trotter via Muckrock on May 31, 2016. This request asks to extract demographic data submitted via the MTA\u2019s online surveys while redacting any personal data to comply with privacy requirements.\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/responses-to-mta-surveys-25929/\r\n\r\nAs required by the Freedom of Information Law, the head or governing body of an agency, or whomever is designated to determine appeals, is required to respond within 10 business days of the receipt of an appeal. If the records are denied on appeal, please explain the reasons for the denial fully in writing as required by law.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please be advised that the Freedom of Information Law directs agencies to send all appeals and the determinations that follow to the Committee on Open Government, Department of State, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Ave., Albany, New York 12231.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDouglas Breitbart",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\n\u00d6zal was born in Turkey and worked for the State Electrical Power Planning Administration from 1950 to 1952. He studied electrical energy and engineering management in the United States from 1952 to 1953, and returned to Turkey to work for the same government organization until 1958. \u00d6zal worked at the World Bank from 1971 to 1973, served as undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel from 1979 to 1980 and was appointed state minister and deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs from 1980 to 1982.\r\n\r\n\u1e26e founded the Motherland Party (Turkish: Anavatan Partisi) in 1983. \u00d6zal was elected Prime Minister of Turkey later that year, and served in that office until he became President of Turkey in 1989, later dying in office. \u00d6zal maintained close relations with U.S. President George H.W. Bush throughout the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the post Cold War era.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Petti\n\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files mentioning or describing Nicholas Stuyvesant Fish AKA Nick Fish.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available. \r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255.  Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied. \r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to either John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983 or Nathaniel Phillipps, the Ristad Fellow at 559-994-3647.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

A DRRTP provides a residential level of care for Veteran populations including medical, psychiatric, SUD, PTSD, and homelessness.

However, based on some of the web search results I found, it seems that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries, unless there is a clear causal link between the two\u00b2. For example, in Minnesota, a mental injury that results from a physical injury (such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder) may be compensable, but a mental injury that does not have a physical component (such as emotional distress or anxiety) may not be\u2074. Similarly, in product liability cases, courts have been more likely to award damages for mental anguish if the plaintiff suffered a physical injury or was exposed to a substantial risk of physical harm by the defective product\u00b2. Therefore, it seems that courts have generally favored a more objective and tangible approach to assessing damages, rather than a subjective and intangible one. However, this may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each case, as well as the applicable law and precedent.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Damages & Compensation for Mental Anguish in a Personal Injury ... - AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/damages-compensation-mental-aguish.html.\r\n(2) Mental vs. Physical Work Injuries (How Do They Differ?). https://mottazsiskinjurylaw.com/physical-vs-mental-work-injury/.\r\n(3) Damages and Compensation in a Personal Injury Lawsuit | AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/types-of-compensation.html.\r\n(4) Bodily Injury vs Personal Injury (Differences Explained). https://www.schmidtandclark.com/bodily-injury-vs-personal-injury.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. \u201cThen-Chief Judge Howell recently used an \"objective metric\"-Veterans Affairs disability ratings-to guide her in departing from the Heiser awards. See Schooley v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 17-cv-1376, 2019 WL 2717888, at ~7475 (D.D.C. June 27, 2019). VA disability ratings are \"a specialized agency s official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\" Id. at 74 ( cleaned up). Because VA ratings roll mental and physical injuries into one number, they facilitate a more objective approach to awarding damages. This is so because courts need not weigh whether certain injuries merit more money than others. See id.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for your message. It seems that you are interested in the use of VA disability ratings as a way of determining damages for mental and physical injuries in cases involving terrorism. Based on the web search results I found, VA disability ratings are a system that evaluates the degree of disability caused by service-connected conditions for veterans. The ratings range from 0% to 100%, and they affect the amount of monthly compensation and other benefits that veterans receive\u00b9\u00b2. VA disability ratings are based on the evidence submitted by the veterans or obtained from military records, and they may include a VA medical examination in some cases\u00b2.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using VA disability ratings as an objective metric for awarding damages is that they provide a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the veterans' ability to function and earn income. They also avoid the need for courts to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify\u00b3. Furthermore, VA disability ratings reflect the official determination of a specialized agency that has expertise and experience in dealing with service-related disabilities\u2074.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may also be some limitations and challenges in applying VA disability ratings to non-veterans or to injuries that are not service-connected. For example, VA disability ratings may not capture the full extent of the pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of enjoyment of life that victims of terrorism may experience. They may also not account for the differences in individual circumstances, such as age, education, occupation, or family situation, that may affect the severity and duration of the injuries. Additionally, VA disability ratings may not be available or reliable for some victims, especially those who are not U.S. citizens or residents, or those who have not sought or received medical treatment or diagnosis for their injuries\u2074.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while VA disability ratings may offer a useful and objective tool for assessing damages for mental and physical injuries in some cases, they may not be sufficient or appropriate for all cases. Courts may need to consider other factors and sources of evidence, such as expert testimony, medical records, personal statements, or witness accounts, to determine the fair and reasonable amount of compensation for each victim\u2074.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) 2023 Veterans Disability Compensation Rates | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/.\r\n(2) About VA Disability Ratings | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/about-disability-ratings/.\r\n(3) VACI's 2023 VA Disability Calculator - VA Claims Insider. https://vaclaimsinsider.com/va-disability-rating-calculator/.\r\n(4) Veterans\u2019 Benefits Rating and Rates | ChooseVA. https://choose.va.gov/disability/ratings-and-rates.\r\n(5) VA Math - How Combined VA Disability Ratings Are Calculated. https://themilitarywallet.com/va-math-combined-disability-ratings/.\u201d\r\n\r\n6. \u201cgiven \"that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries\" could it be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is incredibly significant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is an interesting question. I am not a legal expert, but based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b9 awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant in several ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, it shows that the court recognized the severity and impact of the mental injuries suffered by the plaintiffs, who were victims of a terrorist attack, and did not discount or diminish their claims based on the lack of physical injuries or evidence. The court stated that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are no less real than their physical injuries, and no less deserving of compensation.\\\"\u00b9 The court also noted that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are not merely transient or fleeting, but rather chronic and enduring, affecting their daily lives and relationships for years after the attack.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nSecond, it shows that the court applied an objective metric, namely the VA disability ratings, to determine the relative degree of injury suffered by each service-member plaintiff. The court explained that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating is a specialized agency's official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\\\"\u00b9 The court also stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating provides a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the plaintiffs' ability to function and earn income.\\\"\u00b9 The court further stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating avoids the need for this Court to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nThird, it shows that the court followed the precedent set by other cases involving victims of terrorism, such as Akins v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b2, where the court also awarded damages based on the VA disability ratings. The court in Schooley cited Akins as an example of a case where \\\"the plaintiffs' mental injuries were compensable even though they did not suffer any physical injuries as a result of the terrorist attack.\\\"\u00b9 The court in Schooley also noted that \\\"[t]he use of VA disability ratings as a measure of damages is consistent with other cases in this district involving victims of terrorism.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nTherefore, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant because it demonstrates the court's recognition, objectivity, and consistency in compensating victims of terrorism for their mental and physical injuries.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Schooley v.

The handbook establishes workplace policies, procedures and protocols for creating and implementing guidance for all VA programs and activities consistent with the changes to the Rehabilitation Act required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008, which reinstated the broad scope of individuals protected under the ADA and Section 504\u00b9. The handbook also outlines the roles and responsibilities of various VA offices and officials in ensuring compliance with Section 504, as well as the procedures for handling complaints, appeals, and enforcement actions related to disability discrimination\u00b9. The handbook is intended to help VA foster optimal organizational environments to protect the rights of beneficiaries, with disabilities, of VA programs or activities\u00b9.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTING SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1134&FType=2.\r\n(2) Department of Veterans Affairs VA DIRECTIVE 6500 February 24, 2021 VA .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1254&FType=2.\r\n(3) Blind Justice-VA Vet Center Update - Auditors United. https://auditorsunited.org/a/2023/03/25/blind-justice-va-vet-center-update/.\r\n(4) Department of Veterans Affairs VA HANDBOOK 6500 February 24, 2021 RISK .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1255&FType=2.\u201d\r\n\r\n8. \u201ccould it be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a hypothetical question that may depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. However, based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination if it results in denying or limiting the access, benefits, or opportunities of qualified individuals with disabilities to any program or activity operated by the federal agency. According to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u2074, which prohibits discrimination based on disability in any program or activity operated by recipients of federal funds or conducted by a federal agency, discrimination may include:\r\n\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Denying a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services;\r\n- Affording a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services that is not equal to that afforded others;\r\n- Providing a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Otherwise limiting a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefits, or services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if an employee of a federal agency intentionally provides false or misleading information about a program or activity that affects the rights, privileges, advantages, or opportunities of individuals with disabilities, it could be considered a form of discrimination under Section 504. However, this would have to be proven by evidence and may be subject to legal defenses and exceptions.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) HHS Issues New Proposed Rule to Strengthen Prohibitions Against .... https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/07/hhs-issues-new-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-prohibitions-against-discrimination-on-basis-of-disability-in-health-care-and-human-services-programs.html.\r\n(2) Employment Laws: Disability & Discrimination - U.S. Department of Labor. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/publications/fact-sheets/employment-laws-disability-and-discrimination.\r\n(3) Disability Discrimination: Overview of the Laws - U.S. Department of .... https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/guid/ocr/disabilityoverview.html.\r\n(4) Disability Discrimination - U.S. Department of Education. https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/pro-students/disability-pr.html.\u201d\n",

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?\r\n\r\n26.

Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.   He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n29.   From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n30.   As I understand it, the VASP is set to be introduced at \u201c\u2026.the beginning of October\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n31.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ubxwuoe4rxoc2j80mrfo/Automated-Decision-Support-VBA-Home-Loans.pdf?rlkey=rs0pnc6x8j9lmm194fgiq9ez9&dl=0\r\n\r\n32.   There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n3. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n4.

The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records.

The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing a first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.120(4) we are charging a 10% deposit in order to produce about 9,860 records.

This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\n\r\nFEES \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnorthshore-school-district-19364%252Fnorthshore-school-district-2022-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-the-district-responses-for-the-year-2022-139881%252F%253Femail%253Ddhale%252540nsd.org&url_auth_token=AABqm3KTjnRnsYl087E0T7tox2g%3A1pNDat%3AkmXItEP7jDQCdv4d-DxsmNp1CdrhyvhHfnW0uCSj0eg \r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nMYJUJCRU \r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 139881-52091718@requests.muckrock.com \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 139881 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests. Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable. The records requested have been assembled and are available for inspection. Please note the records are provided in two different ways. All are labeled by request number. Most have folders and some are just PDFs. Example: N403 is a folder that holds communications and records for that public record request. There are also single PDFs identified by number, N399 for example, is only a PDF and is a copy of the communications of the public record request, no attachments exist. Some of the initial record request submittals have been redacted pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, and its federal implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.1 et seq., are \u201cother statute[s]\u201d per RCW 42.56.070 that exempt or prohibit disclosure of specific records. FERPA prohibits the District from releasing education records about a student that contain personally identifiable information about that student without parental consent. In addition, RCW 28A.605.030 provides that a school may not release students\u2019 education records except as authorized by FERPA or RCW 28A.600.475. Pursuant to FERPA and RCW 28A.605.030, the names of District students and parents have been redacted from education records such that those records no longer personally identify the students.; This is the only redaction applied. To clarify, the bottom of the communications from the initial request will have a parent name and phone number, and email, that information has been redacted pursuant to FERPA.

Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\"\r\n\r\nIf  as you claim,  the requested records are available, provide them by the end of business today in accordance with the original public records request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to fight your own GOVQA portal, and you can provide the records to us via direct email or internet link as originally requested. You have this capability and provide this service to other public records requestors.\r\n\r\nAn agency may not distinguish among persons requesting records per RCW 42.56.080.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this email communication constructive intent to seek relief under RCW 42.56.550(1): allows for judicial review of PRA violations by \u201cany person having been denied an opportunity to inspect or copy a public record by an agency\u201d with the burden on the agency to \u201cshow cause why it has refused to allow inspection or copying of a specific public record or class of records.\u201d \u201cThe burden of proof shall be on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute that exempts or prohibits disclosure in whole or in part of specific information or records.\u201d\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving all records responsive to my original public  records records request today (11-17-23), or in the alternative, later reading of your agency's explanation as to why it was reasonable for the Northshore School District to refuse to allow inspection or copying of these requested, identified, responsive public records for over two months after they were supposedly made available, on a 3rd party WALLED GARDEN GATEWAY under the the District's exclusive care, custody, and control.\r\n  \r\nHave a pleasant day.\r\n",

I found it helpful to share with you, that the muckrock requests emailed to us do not disclose the requestors name, and there was no way for me to know which request you were trying to reference by leaving your name and the requestor's name on my voicemail. I also passed on to you that the request number in our system is N000564, should you need to contact me for help in the future, please refer to this number.\r\n\r\nYour records should have arrived to you with the subject line: Public Records Request Dated 2/1/2023 (2022 PRRs). It contains a link for you to download all of the records, no password required.\r\n\r\nI hope you have a wonderful weekend.\r\n\r\nElaine Gisle\r\nAdministrative Assistant to the Chief Leadership and Strategy Officer\nNorthshore School District | Phone: 425.408.7621",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

To help us better meet your needs please let us know if you would prefer a summery/ compilation which captures the data points in the list you provided for all employees from Jan 2020 thru Aug 2023 (Option 1) or a copy of all original payroll records for this time period (Option 2).  \r\n\r\nThe timeline for Option 1 is two months to fulfill with a waived cost of $.05 for one electronic file delivery. \r\n\r\nThe timeline for Option 2 is six months to fulfill with an estimated cost of $753.00. This was calculated based on \"Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of KCDA equipment to scan the records\". KCDA runs payroll 2 two times per month, you are requesting copies of 88 payroll reports, each report is about 85 pages plus an additional 50 pages for annual W2s. ( (85 pages * 88 reports) + 50 pages ) x $0.10) = $753.00.  A 10% deposit is required before I can begin making copies, this can be paid in person via cash or check or by mail via check. \r\n\r\nPlease provide clarity on how these records are delivered within 30 days or KCDA may close the request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

This extended delay is inconsistent with the statutory timeframes outlined in New York's Freedom of Information Law, which generally requires a response within 5 business days, or a reason for any delay and a date by which the request will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn *Rattley v. New York City Police Department*, the court emphasized the importance of agencies certifying that they have conducted a \"diligent search\" for requested records when they cannot be located. While I understand that some records may require time to locate, the law mandates that agencies act diligently in these matters.\r\n\r\nGiven the significant public health implications of this variant and the actions being taken by the Governor, the information sought is crucial for the public to understand the basis of governmental actions that have wide-ranging impacts on health and safety.

Subsequently, on September 29, 2023, I was informed of an extension to the response time (Reference: https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/10/01/9.29.23_Ext._Letter_23-08-474.pdf). While I understand the need for occasional extensions, the reasons provided for the delay have not been adequately justified, and the statutory timeline for response has not been adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a) requires that an agency must grant access to or deny access to records within twenty business days of receipt of a request. The extension letter cites the voluminous nature of the request and the need for consultation, which are understood. However, the law also requires that the reason for the delay be explained and that a date be provided by which a determination is expected to be made. The extension letter provided does not specify a date, which leaves the request open-ended and does not comply with the statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe linguistic vagueness in the extension letter does not conform to the adequate justification as required by law. Phrases such as \"voluminous nature\" and \"need for consultation\" are not substantiated with specific details that would warrant such an extension. This lack of specificity fails to meet the standard set forth in the case of Konigsberg v. Coughlin, 68 N.Y.2d 245 (1986), where the court held that the agency must articulate particularized and specific justification for denying access to records.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, I respectfully request that this appeal be considered and that the FOIL request No. 23-08-474 be remanded to the FOIL officer for immediate processing. I also request that the information be provided in a rolling release to expedite the availability of records.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt resolution. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or clarification regarding this appeal.",

In response to your request, the OEMC is providing you with the redacted Situation Reports. Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Additionally, L.E.A.D.S. hit responses, patient condition, unique identifiers, residential addresses, license plate numbers, driver's license numbers and personal telephone numbers have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) which authorizes a public body to redact: Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

The court has recognized that unreasonable delays in producing records may hinder the public's right to access information, and it is essential to adhere to the principles of the California Public Records Act (CPRA) and related laws. \r\n\r\nCPRA stipulates that when a request for records is made, agencies must respond promptly and provide access to records within a reasonable timeframe. Delays in producing records can be seen as a violation of the principles of transparency and accountability that underpin the CPRA.\r\n\r\nAs the agency has a legal obligation to produce records without unnecessary delay, I am looking for either a detailed status update for this request indicating when I can expect records, or the production of the responsive records themselves.  \r\n\r\nI'd like to solve this without a formal complaint or appeal.

The court and DMV needs to be advised. You can look for a traffic stop at Wilder exit Orinda Ca. but I think you will only get the stop. This. is the problem if a lawful traffic break was conducted MVARS should have already been active. The officer also delays turning on the lights after the car passes one can only conclude issues with the 30 second recording to the hard drive and not wanting cockpit recording documented.

My research focuses on the economic impact of extreme events. I would like to request the raw insurance claims data to analyze the social and economic impacts of Hurricane Michael. Given the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes in Florida, the results of this research will have wide-ranging policy implications and be beneficial to the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlice Tianbo Zhang",

If any additional information is needed, we will notify you prior to issuing a cost estimate, if applicable. We will issue an invoice for payment based upon the cost estimate, if applicable. The invoice must be paid prior to the production of any documents. Please note that the requestor's case will be closed, if the invoice is not paid within forty-five (45) days from the date of invoice.

For voluminous requests, a deposit is required prior to commencing the retrieval of the requested records. Upon notice of OIR's receipt of payment on the invoice, the Public Records Office will coordinate the production of records to fulfill the request.
