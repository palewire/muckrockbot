This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.

Failure to comply with the Texas Public Information Act, including improperly withholding or redacting information without proper justification, may result in litigation, including but not limited to an Article 78 proceeding to compel compliance.\r\n\r\nSubject: Texas Public Information Act Request \u2013 Investigations and Surveillance of Black Lives Matter\r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Chapter 552 of the Government Code), I am writing to request access to specific records held by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) related to the investigation and surveillance of the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) and its local chapters (e.g., BLM Houston, BLM Dallas, BLM Austin) from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nRequested Information:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInvestigation Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tDates and brief descriptions of the last three instances where BLM or its local chapters were investigated or surveilled by the DPS.\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of investigation reports, including initial reports, progress reports, and final reports.\r\n\t2.\tContextual Documents:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal memos, emails, and other communications (including attachments) related to the initiation, conduct, and conclusion of the investigations.\r\n\t\u2022\tDocuments detailing the purpose of the investigations, the methodologies used, and the findings of each investigation.\r\n\t\u2022\tMeeting notes or summaries from any internal meetings where these investigations were discussed.\r\n\t3.\tPublic Safety Assessments:\r\n\t\u2022\tAssessments or analyses discussing the public safety implications of these investigations.\r\n\t\u2022\tRisk assessments or threat evaluations that were conducted as part of or in conjunction with these investigations.\r\n\t4.\tPolicies and Procedures:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to the surveillance or investigation of BLM or related groups.\r\n\t\u2022\tTraining materials or manuals used by DPS personnel in conducting such investigations.\r\n\t5.\tInteragency Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence between DPS and other law enforcement agencies (local, state, or federal) regarding the investigation or surveillance of BLM.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords of any interagency meetings or collaborations related to these investigations.\r\n\t6.\tElectronic Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, text messages, and other forms of electronic communication from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021, that include any of the following keywords: \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cBLM,\u201d \u201cBLM Houston,\u201d \u201cBLM Dallas,\u201d \u201cBLM Austin,\u201d \u201cprotest,\u201d \u201cdemonstration,\u201d \u201crally,\u201d \u201cactivist,\u201d \u201csurveillance,\u201d \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\r\n\t7.\tPrevious Request Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll records of email communications, internal memos, notes, and any other correspondence related to my previous Texas Public Information Act request (PIR# 23-1052, Tracking #2023-24018), which sought documents related to the surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter and related groups. This includes any communications between the DPS and other entities concerning the processing, handling, or response to this request.\r\n\r\nAddressing Common Exceptions:\r\nI am aware that DPS has previously cited sections 552.101 and 552.108 of the Government Code, as well as section 418.177 of the Texas Homeland Security Act (HSA), as grounds for withholding information. However, these exceptions do not universally apply to the requested information:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tSection 552.101 and 418.177: Section 418.177 pertains specifically to information related to the prevention, detection, or investigation of terrorism or related criminal activity. General law enforcement investigations that do not directly pertain to terrorism do not fall under this provision. The case Texas Department of Public Safety v. Cox Texas Newspapers, LP, 304 S.W.3d 191 (Tex. App. \u2013 Austin 2009), clarified that the public\u2019s right to transparency outweighs broad claims of confidentiality under general security concerns.\r\n\t\u2022\tSection 552.108: This section is intended to protect information related to ongoing law enforcement proceedings or internal records used for law enforcement purposes. In City of Dallas v. Abbott, 304 S.W.3d 380 (Tex. 2010), it was clarified that unless the release of information would interfere with law enforcement or prosecution, the information should be disclosed. Additionally, the peaceful nature of BLM activities typically does not warrant withholding information under this provision.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as established in Dallas Morning News v. City of Dallas, 281 S.W.3d 708 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas 2009), a government entity cannot withhold requested information unless it can demonstrate that the information falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act. Any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents must be accompanied by a specific and detailed justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the requested information is considered exempt, I request a written explanation specifying the legal grounds for each redaction or withholding, including references to the specific statutory provisions that justify the exemption.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with the Texas Public Information Act, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is for the sake of public transparency and is not for commercial purposes. Should there be any fees associated with this request, despite the waiver request, please inform me of the total charges in advance. I would prefer the request to be fulfilled electronically via email, but I am also open to receiving the information in other formats if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response within the 10 business days required by statute.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nICE detainee death records for Julio Cesar Chirino Peralta, a 32 year-old migrant from Nicaragua, who died following his detention at the Port Isabel Detention Center on October 8, 2023 (see https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrJulioCesarChirinoPeralta.pdf): \r\n\r\n1. The Office of Professional Responsibility Detainee Death Review (search the External Reviews and Analysis Unit within ICE OPR); \r\n2. The Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis report (search ERAU); \r\n3. the IHSC Mortality Review (search the ICE Health Service Corps); \r\n4. The IHSC Root Cause Analysis, if any (search IHSC). \r\n\r\nWe request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and provide the following statements in support of our request under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. At the time of this request, ICE deaths in custody have doubled the highest levels from previous years of the Biden administration. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/number-deaths-ice-custody-already-double-last-year-rcna154659#:~:text=NBC%20News%20Tipline-,The%20number%20of%20deaths%20in%20ICE%20custody%20is%20already%20more,of%20the%20six%20preceding%20years.\r\n2. The current rate of in-custody ICE deaths is on track to exceed any non-COVID year since FY17. See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11007418/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870381/\r\n3. Deaths in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread, ongoing media coverage and extensive policy advocacy and discussion. See, e.g. ,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211316303/ice-releases-investigation-into-immigrants-death-after-months-of-inexcusable-del; https://www.yahoo.com/news/number-deaths-ice-custody-already-133000592.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALCThkPLfU2ufNLo_I3yqmeUO38qEyUSI4U597M71FTc3npyfor0xVw-REfCt-2anUv5517ufGPQZZuU4KKiJ98axkk_ivGQf5e9Gu_gYZaHzjunplOd3-7tEQTfDoPBn6g0zjNvYt8aKSYJBBN9iLv2gvnes6k94yMIMemD-0yw; https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/us/migrant-death-ice-custody-recommended-release/index.html.\r\n4. There exist serious questions regarding the government's capacity to ensure safe and humane detention conditions that prevent deaths in ICE custody, based on available FOIA records obtained through federal litigation.  See, e.g., https://prismreports.org/2023/04/20/ice-gourgan-mirimanian-death-2018/; https://today.usc.edu/ice-deaths-custody-detention-medical-standards-violated-usc-study/\r\n5. ICE has announced its intention to expand its detention system, potentially increasing the numbers of in-custody death to even higher levels. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-announces-ongoing-work-optimize-enforcement-resources\r\n6. ICE has previously failed to accurately inform the public of its own internal agency conclusions about the events leading up to in-custody deaths. See, e.g., https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/April-2024-ACLU-Letter-to-ICE-on-Torrance-Detention-Facility.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is a compelling need to obtain these records as soon as possible so that the public can understand the consequences of ICE's current detention management processes as the agency seeks to expand the system beyond its appropriated limit of 41,500 beds.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nNOTICE RE: EXEMPT RECORDS \u2014 INVESTIGATIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for making a request for records from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department (Department).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d) has concluded its review of the Public Records Act request, wherein you seek: \u201cthe log of CSS uses or disaggregated data showing the number of times the agency used its CSS.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDepartment records indicate that, year to date, a cell site simulator has been deployed 208 times. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the cell site simulator log contains confidential and investigative information. This material is exempt from disclosure. Government Code section 7923.600, subdivision (a) exempts from California Public Records Act disclosure \u201cany investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes.\u201d These records are exempt from disclosure, even if the prospect of enforcement proceedings is not concrete and definite. (Haynie v. Superior Court (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061,1069; Black Panther Party v. Kehoe (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 654; Younger v. Berkeley City Council (1st Dist. 1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 825, 833; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440.) The records remain protected from disclosure even after an investigation has concluded. (Williams v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 355\u2013362.) Further, the release of such records could violate the privacy rights of involved parties. The California Public Records Act recognizes that the right to privacy is a fundamental interest that the California Constitution protects. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7927.700 and 7927.705.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe this determination is in error, or if you have further information that you wish to provide to us regarding your request, kindly re-submit your request either in person at any Sheriff\u2019s Department station, through our online portal: https://sanbernardinocounty.nextrequest.com/. Please note that, in addition to visiting one of the Department\u2019s stations to make an in-person request for records, you are also welcome to use the portal or email for any future records requests you may have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to review the Department\u2019s Records Request Guidelines (CPRA) and/or the Department\u2019s California Public Records Act FAQs information on our website at: https://wp.sbcounty.gov/sheriff/divisions/information-services/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for making a request for records from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at San Bernardino County.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",
