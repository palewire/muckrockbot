        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKayla Fox\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nfox.kayl@northeastern.edu\r\n(312) 718-0331\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",

For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

According to a Virginia FOIA Counsel Review,  the requirements to convene a closed meeting are set forth in subsection A of \u00a7 2.2-3712, which reads in full as follows: A. No closed meeting shall be held unless the public body proposing to convene such meeting has taken an affirmative recorded vote in an open meeting approving a motion that (i) identifies the subject matter, (ii) states the purpose of the meeting and (iii) makes specific reference to the applicable exemption from open meeting requirements provided in \u00a7 2.2-3707 or subsection A of \u00a7 2.2-3711. The matters contained in such motion shall be set forth in detail in the minutes of the open meeting. A general reference to the provisions of this chapter, the authorized exemptions from open meeting requirements, or the subject matter of the closed meeting shall not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements for holding a closed meeting.\" The redacted portions of the agenda are clearly and purely the \"subject matter\" in terms of the general tpics covered. Further, it is unclear how the simply listing of the topics to be covered in Closed session are \"Superintendent's Working Papers\" since they do not fit the definition of that term. If you intent to continue claiming this exemption further detail and associated legal opinion from the Attorney General's Office is required as the current response is in conflict with FOIA Counsel advice and published opinions. Please resend these records with the redactions of the subject matter removed.",

Nothing in the schedules provided \"indicates the notices for the meeting were also changed.\" The meeting notice posted on Jan. 21, 2025, states, \"The Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors is conducting meetings on Feb. 6 - 8, 2025, during the times indicated on the meeting schedule posted in the\u00a0Upcoming Meetings\u00a0section of the VMI Board of Visitors website.\" The change in schedule was posted on the Upcoming Meetings page on Feb. 5, 2025. No change to the meeting notice was necessary nor made. The meeting notice is publicly available at https://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/bov/ay2425/2502PublicNotice.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe redactions in file 2502 Schedule.pdf are not improper. The board president made proper motions which stated the purpose, identified the subject matter, and cited the proper code section for the closed session exemptions. Each time, the motion was approved by a vote of the board. (Archived video of the closed session motions are available at the VMI Board of Visitors YouTube page.) The redacted record was created at the superintendent's request for his personal use, thereby making the record a \"working paper\" in accordance with the \"working paper\" definition in Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3705.7.(2.). In the spirit of transparency, the record, which could have been withheld in its entirety, was released with redactions. The redactions contain notes that were created for the superintendent's use during closed session. Such notes are not subject to disclosure under Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3705.1.(5.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Virginia Military Institute.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G.

Public records requests are addressed by first in time and first in payment if advanced pay is required.  If a public records request is small in volume or contains little to no exemptions or confidential information for redaction, we may address it more quickly.  Your public records request is in the queue to be completed.  It will be completed in a reasonable time pursuant to Florida Statutes.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSUSAN S.

Specifically, you requested:\r\n\r\n'Lee Atwater (Harvey LeRoy \"Lee\" Atwater).\"\r\n\r\nAll publicly available records are proactively available on our website for free at www.fec.gov<http://www.fec.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n              If your request is satisfied you do not need to reply.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires that requests \"reasonably describe\" the records sought such that an agency employee familiar with the subject area of the request can locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A).  We have determined that your request does not adequately describe the records sought, and are therefore unable to process it at this time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am writing you to clarify your request to reasonably describe the records you seek.  There are several ways in which you may clarify this information.  For instance, by providing a date range for your request (e.g., \"August 2017-the date of my request,\" or \"January through June of 2016\").  Additionally, you should add 'terms; to search. \"fraud\", \"Wednesday\", \"Convention\" etc.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive your written response clarifying what records you are seeking within 20 working days from the date of this letter, we will assume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request and will administratively close this request. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.5(d).\r\n\r\nPlease reference the above FOIA request number in your response and any other communications with our office.  Should you need further assistance regarding this request, please contact the FOIA Requester Service Center at FOIA@fec.gov<mailto:FOIA@fec.gov> or (202) 694-1650.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIA Requester Service\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nCopies of memoranda, letters and reports produced in response to CIA-RDP85T00153R000300020043-0 (attached), including but not limited to any resulting studies or analysis as suggested in point 4 of the attached memo. \r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nDue to the Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, there is an obvious and undeniable public interest in understanding the history of this problem as it applies to the U.S. elections and the Cheka's evolving attempts to influence the outcome of U.S. elections.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEmma Best",

        "communication": "Dear Public Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request for public records under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).\r\n\r\nUnder SB 978, a law passed in 2018, \"each local law enforcement agency shall conspicuously post on their Internet Web sites all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials that would otherwise be available to the public if a request was made pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\"* I was unable to locate the California Exposition and State Fair Police Department documents on its website. \r\n\r\nPursuant to CPRA, I request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials in use by the California Exposition and State Fair Police Department\r\n\r\nIf these records are already available online, please provide me with the direct links to them. Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\" \r\n  \r\n The District gathered the released contract with School Links from files maintained by the District's Purchasing department. Please use this link: Spokane Public Schools Records Requests - Track request (justfoia.com) to view and download an installment of the requested records. Request Number PRR-2024-151 Security Key A5C9DFA2 \r\n  \r\n As a security precaution, the access to the records being released to you today, will be removed after 30 days. If you would like to view the records after 30 days please keep a copy of the records. \r\n  \r\n Under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency\u2019s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records. \r\n  \r\n If you do not view the records within 30 days, the District will consider your request to be closed as abandoned. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of the District\u2019s response and records produced will begin to run on the 31st day of this notice to you. The District does not intend to further address an abandoned request. The one year statute of limitations means you have one year to challenge the District\u2019s response and responsive records released to you. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please let us know. \r\n  \r\n The Washington State Public Records Act RCW 42.56, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested. The District anticipates being able to release records responsive to your public record request on or before February 20, 2025. If we are able to provide the records to you sooner, we will do so. If we have misunderstood or misinterpreted your request please let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",

You have access via the portal to view and download the requested records. As a security precaution, after 30 days, the access to the records will be removed. If you would like to view the records after 30 days please keep a copy of the downloaded records. Please use this link: Request Number: PRR-2024-151 to download the responsive documents. \r\n  \r\n You will see some records have been redacted or blacked out with a text box that has a numbered code (01 through 23) in white writing over the top. An explanation to the codes will be added to the last page of each record or email that has a redaction. You will know which record or email has been redacted as the word \u201cRedacted\u201d has been added to the end of the title of the record. \r\n  \r\n You will also see some records with black Sharpie marks. Those marks were placed on the records prior to this request and were given to the public. The black Sharpie marks are covering student information and would likely be redacted under RCW 42.56.230(2)(a)(iii) to protect student information. \r\n  \r\n Under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency\u2019s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records. \r\n  \r\n The District has provided invoices, agreements, presentations and other records of Schoolinks shown to the public, students, or staff. This concludes the District\u2019s response to this request as the District considers this request to be fulfilled and closed. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of the District\u2019s response and records produced has started to run because the District does not intend to further address this request. The one year statute of limitations means you have one year to challenge the District\u2019s response and responsive records released to you. \r\n  \r\n If you have follow up questions about this request, please ask within the next 30 days. Please let us know if you believe additional responsive records have not been provided or if we have misunderstood or misinterpreted your request. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N.

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to National Institute of Standards and Technology's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \r\n\r\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI received your request for \"unedited videos\" from the Nicolae Miu case. This is NOT something I could release to you legally as all videos WILL be edited and redacted. There were many juveniles in this case and juveniles are a protected class, as well as victims who are protected under Marsy's Law. Below is the letter that explains all redactions made to all videos relating to the Nicolae Miu case. The cost to receive this request is just shy of $20 and it is far too large to send electronically. Please let me know if you are still interested in receiving the case file that was sent out to all requesters; media and otherwise, and I will send a flash drive and invoice around March. Thank you,\r\n\r\nDear Records Requester:\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your request for records regarding St. Croix County Sheriff's Office case SO2022006400. The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office does have records that meet your request. The Spanish language interviews are included in these records.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis. Stats \u00a7\u00a7938.396(1)(c)2 law enforcement records involving a juvenile may be released to another party only with the written consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile, or the juvenile themselves, if the juvenile is 14 years or older. I did not receive a single written consent form with any of your requests for records; therefore, all videos, photos, and reports mentioning or showing juveniles under the age of eighteen have been redacted or removed from the case files prior to release. The only exception I have knowingly made is that I have kept the deceased victim, Isaac Schuman's name only intact throughout. In applying the balancing act, disclosure of this already publicly named victim outweighs the interest in non-disclosure of this information. Pursuant to Schilling v. Crime Victims Rights Bd., 2005 WI 17, \u00b626, 278 Wis. 2d 216, 692 N.W.2d 623. The public policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of crime-especially children affected by very sensitive crimes-weighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.\r\n\r\nWell-established public policy recognizes the privacy rights of a deceased person's surviving loved ones. Cf. National Archives and Records Admin. V. Favish, 540 U.S. 157, 168, 171-72 (2004). In preparing these records for release, the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test was applied, and the public interest in treating loved ones of the deceased individual with respect for their privacy and dignity outweighed any public interest in disclosure of any graphic images in photographs and videos of Isaac Schuman; therefore any images of Isaac and his family have been removed or redacted prior to release.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pertaining to the release of law enforcement records, the harm to the public interest caused by the release of identities of victims of crimes overrides the public interest in release. Based on Marsy's Law, there is a strong public policy favoring nondisclosure of some of the requested records for the protection of the victims detailed within the reports. The policy implications as set forth in Article I, Section 9m of the Wisconsin Constitution and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 950.01 is that all victims of crimes are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, sensitivity, and privacy. \u00a7 950.04(1v)(dr) states victims of all crimes have the following rights: (dr) to not have his or her personal identifiers, as defined in s. 85.103 (1) used or disclosed by a public official, employee, or agency for a purpose that is unrelated to the official responsibilities of the official, employee, or agency. In addition, there is a strong public interest favoring nondisclosure which outweighs the public interest in disclosure based on the potential for further victimization of the innocent victims. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)1 - 1. It shall be the public policy of this state to maintain the privacy of a record subject who is a victim of a sensitive or violent crime and access to data from a body camera used by a law enforcement officer that records such a record subject shall be provided only if the public interest in allowing access is so great as to outweigh that public policy. Our department has received no signed consent forms allowing release of these victims' private information. Records will not be released that contain personal information regarding several stabbing victims from this case.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims and respect their personal information, victim names and images have been redacted.\r\n\r\nIn performing the balancing test, I determined that the public interest in avoiding unnecessary intrusion into the personal lives of persons collaterally mentioned in a law enforcement report outweighs any legitimate public interest in information about the conduct of governmental affairs. Furthermore, I determined that the public interest in protecting the privacy of these individuals, and in facilitating cooperation with law enforcement in sensitive investigations, also outweigh any public interest in disclosure of this described information. Any notebooks, reports, computer screens, audio, or video that may contain this information may be pixelated, muted, beeped out, blacked out, blurred, redacted, or removed. Additionally, the following statutes were applied in reviewing and consideration of releasing these records:\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Dates of birth, phone numbers, driver's license number, passport numbers, social security numbers and addresses for which we have not received a waiver to release have been redacted to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In performing the public records balancing test, pursuant to Wis Stat \u00a719.35(1)(a), I concluded that the public policy in favor of protecting the confidentiality of individual's identifiable information and preventing its misuse upon any subsequent disclosure, as well as the public polices outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7\u00a7 801.19, 801.20 and 801.21, outweighs any public interest in disclosure of the dates of birth, driver's license/state ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses or social security numbers of individual persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   \"Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 146.82, the St. Croix County's Sheriff's Office is not disclosing records that contain protected health information (PHI).\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2 governs people with a reasonable expectation of privacy pictured in law enforcement body camera recordings so some people's images, especially within the hospital, have been protected. Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a751.30 and 19.35, medical information has been redacted or omitted. Medical records may be omitted from release as outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7146.82.\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 51.30(4)(a), records related to mental health welfare checks are confidential and cannot be released except to the subject of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Cellphone extraction records are being withheld. After conducting the balancing test, I have determined that there is a strong public interest against disclosure that outweighs the interest in disclosure in order to protect the privacy of individuals who may be included in the cellphone extraction records that are unrelated to the case/incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to 28 USC \u00a7 534, information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wisconsin Department of Justice that is entered into the Crime Information Bureau is not being disclosed. Specifically, 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1) indicates that information from national crime information databases consisting of identification records, criminal history records, protection orders, and wanted person records may be disseminated to civil or criminal courts for use in domestic violence or stalking cases. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit access to such records for any other purpose. Therefore, any information obtained from the national crime information database is redacted and not being disclosed, pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a719.36(13), personal and business financial account information is considered personal and confidential and has been redacted. Any and all invoices and bank related reports have been removed from your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7165.79, Crime Lab analysis of evidence obtained from law enforcement officers are not subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Personal cell telephone International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which are economically valuable individually identifiable information, were redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In applying the balancing test, DOJ determined the public interest in protecting this economically valuable individually identifiable information from misappropriation or misuse outweighs any public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2, the public's interest in disclosure of other jail inmates is not outweighed by the public interest in non-disclosure. Jail inmates who are not the subject of the record have an expectation of privacy in the jail.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any video which has been redacted to the point there is nothing of value left to release has been omitted from this release.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records laws exist to ensure an open and transparent government. The personal communication of an inmate does not affect government business operations unless it involves a potential safety or security issue as identified in DOC 309.39. Although the inmate is informed of the recordings  of the calls, he or she would likely to be reluctant to communicate if these records were disclosed as a public record. This impact on communication if treated as a releasable public record would undermine the rehabilitative aspect of maintaining communication between the inmate and the inmate's family, friends, government officials, courts and people concerned with the welfare of the inmate. Open communication fosters reintegration into the community and the maintenance of family ties. It motivates the inmate and contributes to the morale and security of the inmate and staff. For these reasons the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office has determined that any of Nicolae Miu's phone calls, video logs, visitation reports, or activities from within our jail are not being released with your request for records.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be more information about law enforcement records pursuant to this request, but the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is not the legal custodian of those records.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DB5A94.6CA98430]\r\n\r\n\r\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\n\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\n\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\n\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov<mailto:Tammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

Also, it is my understanding that several of the parties involved released their own materials. I do not recognize these videos at all. I am not certain they came from our department; however, the case file is humongous so it could be possible. Is there a reason you feel they were our videos and not the courts, or individuals that were there, or another department, such as New Richmond Police or Somerset? I will release our entire case file to you on a flash drive once I get to your name and you can determine at that time if you have the videos you need. The redactions will be as explained in my previous email. Every requester for this case file has received the same materials from our department.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Samuel V. Wilson, a former Army lieutenant general and director of the Defense Intelligence Agency who developed counterinsurgency practices that became widely used during the Vietnam War as part of an American effort to win the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the Vietnamese. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEmma Best",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nManuel Noriega AKA Manuel Antonio Noriega Moreno( February 11, 1934 \u2013 May 29, 2017), who was a Panamanian politician and military officer. He was military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989, when he was removed from power by the United States during the invasion of Panama.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or attachments. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEmma Best",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request records related to ID verification and unemployment fraud detection tools used by the department.\r\n\r\nIn an Unemployment Insurance Program Letter published in November 2023  (UIPL No. 1-24), the U.S. Department of Labor provided the following instructions to state agencies responsible for unemployment benefits:\r\n\r\n\"When a state notices that individuals are unable to verify their ID through web-based or selfservice means, or the state flags individuals as suspicious with automated cross-matching or data analytics activities, states must generate and retain documentation of these instances. States are also required to investigate the flags and make appropriate determinations so that eligible claimants are able to access UI benefits without undue barriers or delay. The state UI agency should then analyze the data to determine if the state\u2019s ID proofing system, fraud detection and prevention solutions, cross-matching and data analytic parameters, or service provider(s) correctly identified fraud or incorrectly flagged claimants. In line with their nondiscrimination obligations under 29 CFR \u00a738.51, states should conduct statistical or other quantifiable data analyses to determine whether their fraud detection systems are disproportionately flagging certain groups.\"\r\n\r\nI request:\r\n\r\n1) All contracts the department has entered into since Jan. 1, 2020 for the provision of unemployment fraud detection tools. This includes identity verification tools and data analytics services such as risk-scoring and fraud-scoring algorithms.\r\n\r\n2) All analyses of the accuracy of the department's fraud detection tools, such as requested by the Department of Labor in UIPL No. 1-24. This should include analyses conducted by the department or provided to the department by the vendor or a third pary since Jan. 1, 2020.\r\n\r\n3) All analyses of whether the department's fraud detection tools disproportionately flag certain groups, as requested by the Department of Labor in UIPL No. 1-24. This should include analyses conducted by the department or provided to the department by the vendor or a third pary since Jan. 1, 2020.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to used the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation of the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to reject this request or redact portions of responsive documents, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",
