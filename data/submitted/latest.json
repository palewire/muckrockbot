Rabbit was born in May 15th of 1905 in the state of Montana and died in March 1961 in Seattle, Washington. Rabbitt was publicly labeled as a communist during the Canwell Committee hearings in Washington State. In the early 1950s Rabbitt was head of the Washington State Progressive Party. \r\n\r\nPlease note: A previous FOIA release (FOIA Request: 1215960-000, SUBJECT: ROSELLINI, ALBERT DEAN) prominently mentions that as of 1952 Rabbitt was a, \"Security Index subject at the Seattle office\" of the FBI. As a \"Security Index subject\" the bureau presumably amassed a significant amount of material on Rabbitt. \r\n\r\nPlease include searches for correspondence either to or from Director Hoover or Clyde Tolson regarding Rabbitt. Please also include a search for correspondence either to or from Mark Felt regarding Rabbit. Felt was assigned to the Seattle office in the early 1950s and could have generated material on Rabbitt during the course of his duties. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Thomas \"Tom\" Carlyle Rabbitt from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Rabbit held by the Seattle or Chicago field offices. Rabbit lived in, and repeatedly visited, the city of Chicago.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Rabbitt. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Thomas Carlyle Rabbitt. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency.

based on the following compelling factors:\r\n\r\nSignificant Public Interest in Government Transparency: Medicaid programs are taxpayer-funded and affect a large segment of the public. Ensuring that DSS\u2019s activities and collaborations with consulting firms like Accenture and Manatt align with federal and state standards is of great public interest. Expedited processing will allow public scrutiny and foster informed dialogue on the management and ethical administration of Medicaid services. The requested information will help assess whether any waste, fraud, or abuse has occurred within DSS\u2019s partnerships. Prompt access to these records is essential to identify any potential misconduct and prevent ongoing misuse of taxpayer dollars, particularly within critical programs affecting vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nTime-Sensitive Advocacy Needs: This information is critical for advocacy efforts that inform stakeholders, ensure consumer protection, and foster transparency. Any delay could impede the ability of stakeholders, including advocacy groups and affected individuals, to respond adequately to Medicaid policy changes.\r\n\r\nJustification for Fee Waiver\r\nThis information will serve the public interest by supporting oversight, transparency, and protection for Medicaid recipients, particularly Connecticut\u2019s ABI Waiver participants. The release of these records will contribute to the ethical and accountable administration of taxpayer-funded programs. Accordingly, I request a waiver of fees for processing this request.\r\n\r\nDelivery and Accessibility Requirements\r\nTo accommodate disability-related needs, please provide all records in digital format via email and avoid using external portals.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Given the scope and importance of these subjects, a thorough investigation and access to all responsive records are crucial.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to reiterate the following basic accommodations that I have consistently requested due to my TBI and specific accessibility needs:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication: All communications regarding this FOIA request should be conducted solely through email. I am unable to communicate effectively by phone, and portals or alternate platforms create significant accessibility barriers.\r\n\r\nFull Response Language in Email Body: For my accessibility, please include the full response text within the body of the email, rather than solely as an attachment. Attachments are difficult for me to access and interpret, impacting my ability to engage with the response fully.\r\n\r\nIdentification of Officers: Please include the full name, title, and direct contact information of the officer managing my request in each communication. This information is critical for accountability and effective communication on my end.\r\n\r\nNo Use of Portals or External Links: In line with my accessibility needs, please avoid using external links, portals, or any resources that would require navigating away from the email. This ensures I can access the information seamlessly within one location.\r\n\r\nClear and Concise Responses: Due to memory and processing challenges associated with my TBI, I request that all responses be clear, comprehensive, and concise, facilitating my ability to stay focused and process the information effectively.\r\n\r\nI request confirmation that these accommodations will be honored in all future communications. Additionally, please confirm receipt of this appeal and provide an update regarding the additional search measures taken to locate all potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to these accommodations and your dedication to ensuring accessibility and completeness in the FOIA process.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nAabiWR@live.com",

This is essential as my inquiry pertains to specific information that, under the decentralized FOIA administration, requires continuity and thorough communication. Given my position and involvement as a documented whistleblower, this transfer to CMS for a separate logging and tracking process should include assurance of continuity, protection from delays, and accessibility in response.\r\n\r\nFurther, I am requesting a basic accommodation that the full language of future responses be included within the body of emails rather than solely as attachments. Due to my documented TBI and associated difficulties, having the response directly in the email body is crucial for my full and effective participation in the FOIA process.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm the transfer details of my request to CMS, including contact points and the assigned tracking number. Additionally, I request CMS acknowledge receipt of my request and fulfill the accommodation of including the full response language within the body of future email communications.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to these matters and for your assistance in facilitating accessible and effective communication in accordance with my rights.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nAabiWR@live.com",
