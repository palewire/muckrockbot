If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the way state allocated funds are being spent. I am a student journalist working on a large scale project dealing with the funds allocated to the state of West Virginia from the National Opioid Settlement. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. The West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. You can call me at 330-978-8228 or send me an email at jlr00026@mix.wvu.edu. My physical address is 1511 University Ave. Morgantown, WV, 26505. If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nJessica Riley",
