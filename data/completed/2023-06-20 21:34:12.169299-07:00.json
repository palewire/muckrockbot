Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

If necessary, please consult with relevant staff or officials who may have knowledge of such records. As stated in my original request, I am requesting all records of any type, including but not limited to emails, letters, memoranda, reports, meeting minutes, presentations, and any other records of communication or correspondence.\r\n\r\nIf no records are responsive to this request, please provide a certification of that fact pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a789(3).

I appreciate the effort in conducting a search for responsive documents related to my request. I understand that the current search yielded 146,371 emails that match the search terms I provided. To assist in reducing the volume of documents and the associated time required for review, I would like to revise and narrow my request as follows:\r\n\r\nPlease limit the search to correspondence involving the following individuals or roles within the South Colonie Central School District:\r\na. Board members\r\nb. Superintendent\r\nc. Assistant Superintendents\r\nd. District Clerk\r\ne. All administrative staff (excluding teachers)\r\n\r\nExclude mass emails and newsletters that are sent to the general public or large groups of recipients. Instead, focus on communications that reference the following organizations, communications directly between the school district and these organizations, or communications where information from these organizations is shared, either through messages or attachments:\r\na. \"American Academy of Pediatrics\"\r\nb. \"AAP\"\r\nc. \"Council on School Health\"\r\nd. \"COSH\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is concerning that the initial response to my FOIL request indicated that no responsive documents existed in your records. I would appreciate an explanation as to why this discrepancy occurred, although I understand this may not be covered under FOIL.\r\n\r\nI hope these revisions will significantly reduce the volume of documents to be reviewed and make the request more manageable. If there are still a considerable number of documents that need review, please provide an estimated fee for processing the narrowed request, and I will determine how to proceed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation and attention to this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Robilotti,\r\n\r\nI am writing to further address my FOIL request for records related to communications between the South Colonie Central School District and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or the Council on School Health (COSH). I understand from your last response that the District is in possession of over 2,000 responsive records.\r\n\r\nGiven that all of the records in question are electronic, I would like to refer to the New York State Committee on Open Government Advisory Opinion FOIL-AO-17734, which discusses the fee provisions of the Freedom of Information Law in relation to requests for records. According to the advisory opinion, when records can be transmitted via email, there would be no \"actual cost\" of reproduction.\r\n\r\nSince the documents are already in electronic form and have been found with reasonably little effort, I would like to clarify my understanding that no associated fees should be applied in this case. This would be in line with the guidance provided by the Committee on Open Government, which states that it is in the public interest to provide access to computerized records at low cost. Moreover, the Court of Appeals has held that the fulfillment of a government obligation to provide public access to information is not a waste of public funds (Doolan v. BOCES, 48 NY 2d 341, 347 [1979]).\r\n\r\nIn light of the electronic nature of the records and the public interest in ensuring access to them without incurring costs, I respectfully request that the District provide the responsive records without any fees. I appreciate your cooperation in this matter and look forward to receiving the records in a timely manner.",

Thank you ever so kindly for your response regarding the fees associated with the fulfillment of my FOIL request. As a follow-up to my previous message, I would like to bring to your attention a pertinent advisory opinion issued by the New York Department of State's Committee on Open Government, FOI-AO-19103, dated January 28, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn this advisory opinion, the Committee addressed the application of the Freedom of Information Law to records requested from the Office of the Attorney General. The opinion delineates that an agency, such as the South Colonie Central School District, is not permitted to charge for time spent reviewing records to determine which portions, if any, may be withheld. Furthermore, electronically removing material from email records is akin to blacking out sentences on a page prior to copying for release. The Freedom of Information Law has consistently required the agency to perform this redaction at no cost to the applicant.\r\n\r\nGiven the aforementioned advisory opinion and considering that the esteemed District is endowed with the necessary technology to effectuate electronic redactions in documents, I kindly emphasize that no fee should be imposed for the copying of files or the redaction of information, per the regulations provided in 21 CRR-NY 1401.8.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the overall District budget for the 2022-2023 year is a remarkable sum of $113,458,885, with approximately $10,000,000 allocated for administrative purposes. With such a munificent budget, I trust that the District has the means to fulfill my FOIL request without imposing undue fees.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the District encounters any difficulty in obtaining the requisite technology or personnel to execute the redactions, I am delighted to provide, a list of free software that can be employed for this purpose:\r\n\r\nLibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org/)\r\nPDF-XChange Editor (https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor)\r\nPDFescape (https://www.pdfescape.com/)\r\n\r\nWith the utmost respect, I humbly reiterate my request that the District waive the fees associated with the fulfillment of my FOIL request, save for the reasonable photocopying fees permitted under 21 CRR-NY 1401.8(b)(3) for redacted records, in compliance with the regulations provided in 21 CRR-NY 1401.8 and the advisory opinion FOI-AO-19103. Please note that these fees would only apply to records justifying redaction for which electronic redaction is not possible. That being said, sufficient information has been presented in this email, along with the said means of the District, which should be adequate for waiving fees on this request. I do hope this request is not too forward, and I extend my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation in this matter. I eagerly anticipate receiving the responsive records in a timely manner.",

        "communication": "Dear Assistant Superintendent Robilotti,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response and for taking the time to consult with your legal counsel regarding my FOIL request.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand and respect the stance of the District, I wish to further engage on this issue in the spirit of transparency, and I believe further clarification is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe regulation 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8 that your counsel has pointed out permits charging a fee under certain circumstances. However, considering the language of the regulation and the nature of my request, I am unable to fully understand the breakdown of the costs proposed by the District.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, paragraph (c)(1) of this regulation permits an agency to charge a fee equivalent to the hourly salary of the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill to prepare a copy of the requested record, but only when more than two hours of the said employee's time are required to do so. Therefore, I respectfully request clarification on which tasks involved in the preparation of my FOIL request required more than two hours to fulfill.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, paragraph (d) relates to retrieving or extracting a record or data maintained in a computer storage system. If this was part of the process in responding to my request, I kindly request further clarification on how much of the proposed fee is associated with this procedure.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while it is acknowledged that the District has the discretion to impose a fee according to paragraph (g) of the said regulation, it is also stated in the same paragraph that an agency may waive a fee in whole or in part when making copies of records available. Considering the public interest of the information I am seeking and its importance for public transparency, I kindly reiterate my request for a waiver of these fees.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay the fee for the sake of transparency on this crucial topic; however, I believe it is important to uphold the principles of FOIL, and that any charges should align with the regulations set out in 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8. Therefore, I request a detailed breakdown of the fee, including a justification for each component.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I extend my sincere gratitude for your assistance in this matter, and I am eagerly looking forward to your response.",

        "communication": "Dear Christopher Robilotti,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the fees associated with my recent Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request to the South Colonie Central School District. I appreciate your detailed breakdown of the proposed fee, however, I believe there may be a misunderstanding regarding the application of the regulations outlined in 21 NYCRR Part 1401, specifically section 1401.8.\r\n\r\nAs per your breakdown, the fee includes:\r\n\r\n1. 1 hour @ $50.00 - For refining the original request to its current state.\r\n2. 2.5 hours @ $75.00 - For your review of all 636 pages before releasing them.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the regulations, I would like to draw your attention to the following:\r\n\r\n1. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(a)(2) states that an agency shall not charge a fee for the search for, administrative costs of, or employee time to prepare photocopies of records. This seems to contradict the first part of the fee you have proposed, which charges for the time spent refining the original request.\r\n\r\n2. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(a)(3) states that an agency shall not charge a fee for the review of the content of requested records to determine the extent to which records must be disclosed or may be withheld. This appears to contradict the second part of the fee you have proposed, which charges for your review of the pages before they are released.\r\n\r\n3. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(c)(i) allows an agency to charge a fee based on the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare a copy of the requested record, but only when more than two hours of the employee\u2019s time is necessary to do so. If the time spent refining the original request and reviewing the pages before they are released is considered as time spent preparing a copy of the requested record, it would seem that the total time spent is less than two hours, and thus, according to this regulation, should not be chargeable.\r\n\r\n4. 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8(g) allows an agency to waive a fee in whole or in part when making copies of records available. Given the public interest in the requested records and the potential for the fees to be a barrier to access, I would like to request that the South Colonie Central School District consider waiving the fees associated with this request.\r\n\r\nI understand the complexity of this issue and the importance of your role in this process. However, my objective is to ensure that the proposed fee aligns with the principles and regulations set out in 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.8. I would appreciate further clarification on the interpretation of this regulation and a reconsideration of the fees associated with my request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this issue.

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Marie Tamburro",

Here, you will find the list of all blocked profiles.\r\nGiven that these records relate to a public department's social media, which is utilized for communication with and among the public, they should fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to two cases related to social media blocking and the First Amendment. The first is Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump (2017), where the court found that blocking users from an official's Twitter account, which is used as a public forum, is a violation of their First Amendment rights. The second is Davison v. Randall (2019), where the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals extended this reasoning to local officials.\r\n\r\nWhile these cases deal with blocking individuals on Twitter, they provide the legal context under which public officials and departments must operate when considering whether to block individuals from their social media accounts.\r\n\r\nGiven these precedents, the block list of the Ossining Police Department's Twitter account should constitute disclosable public records under the FOIA as they pertain to potential infringements on First Amendment activity.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nWe are currently looking for any responsive records and at this time I estimate that it will take approximately thirty to sixty days to prepare records located that are responsive parts 1 and 2 of your request.\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request.  If you can narrow your requested records types, be more specific to the types of records for which you are seeking or provide additional search terms this may reduce the estimate of time. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the first installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about March 5, 2020 regarding the status of your request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D5DC3A.5D218770]\r\nJoey Christine Grant\r\nPublic Records Manager\r\nEmail: jgrant@tacoma.k12.wa.us<mailto:jgrant@tacoma.k12.wa.us>\n",

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the second installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link: https://app.box.com/shared/static/3gg5cud3r1xrcb9byk4tgqqrmeagsiqv.pdf This link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by May 3, 2020, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. All redactions are due to personal privacy RCW 42.56.230 (3).\r\n\r\nWe are currently looking for any responsive records and at this time I estimate that it will take approximately thirty to sixty days to prepare records located that are responsive parts 1 and 2 of your request.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request.  If you can narrow your requested records types, be more specific to the types of records for which you are seeking or provide additional search terms this may reduce the estimate of time. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the third installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about May 1, 2020 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\nEnclosures: Bates Numbers 001929-004621\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the tenth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/1ahxwm28uvc8so10961325o75y2u5de4\r\nIf you need any assistance accessing this link, please let me know. This link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by January 11, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions, however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Therefore, we have chosen to notify you within the previous letters. If we find more than one exemption type in future installments, we will create a log noting these exemptions.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about January 11, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 009980-010085\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the thirteenth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/5yecs57obnqxwfwors7v7q01tj10nlqz\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by April 11, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth installment, there is an exemption log noting another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately two weeks, on March 25, 2021. I will contact you on or about March 25, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 010470-010794\r\n                       2021 03 11 Exemption Log PRR 2020-00019\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D71685.A8B6E960]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the seventeenth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/nr4xogcvbhazcp7mv1asnviyk0yakbjr\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by August 1, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth and fourteenth installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth installments, and there are no exemptions for this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, August 1, 2021. I will contact you on or about August 1, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 018821-020939\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D76E77.B0D2AF40]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth and fourteenth installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth installments, nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first and there is an exemption for this current installment. Included you will find the exemption log noting another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, November 13, 2021.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the twenty-fourth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/l8b6tcqoa9l7oyr1vrcwr2ydjuicgiya\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by February 24, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, February 24, 2022. I will contact you on or about February 24, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 034674-036996\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8113B.BD8BFB80]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the twenty-ninth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/u8a98k2p8lqn305p22tq4409qg8yh30m\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by June 23, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, June 23, 2022. I will contact you on or about June 23, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 042356-044177\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D86EB4.7F46BAA0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirty-third installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/shared/static/ep59nxs44yx4rhsxs10rmk8zl91bbzgo.pdf\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by October 22, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, October 22, 2022.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirty-fifth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/ur86dn1ccotgwiutcpgssinkfhb19ubx\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by January 9, 2023, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, 9, 2023. I will contact you on or about January 9, 2023 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\nBates Numbers 052207-053509\r\nEmployee Discipline and Misconduct Workshop Materials_NOV 2015\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D90BDA.31D66310]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirty-eighth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/ry3o8yflg39um0467litb7usa6v3gf73\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by April 16, 2023, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments. I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, April 17, 2023. I will contact you on or about April 17, 2023, regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:\r\nBates Numbers 055710-056112\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSusan R.

Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th, 39th, 40th or this current installment.\r\nBased on the District's understanding of your request, I believe we have now completed our search and provided you with all records that we have been able to locate that are responsive. Please promptly let me know if you believe we have misunderstood your request in any way or if you believe that we have not adequately responded to your request, and I will be happy to assist you further.

        "communication": "Dear Records Access Officer:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of OOM's determination regarding FOIL request FOIL-2022-002-00358 on February 24, 2023, as well as its determinations on June 15, 2022; September 13, 2022; October 25, 2022; and December 27, 2022. All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request.\r\n\r\nOOM has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended nearly 10 months after I submitted the request on April 26, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request.\r\n\r\nOOM has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended more than 10 months after I submitted the request on March 24, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1.

Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3.

For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6.

Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",

Please let me know if you require any additional information.\r\n\r\nIn regards to your mention of the deadline for response, I would like to inform you that the use of \"Are you still interested\" goes against the guidelines provided by the FOIA.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing George S. Vest.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

However, the continuous extensions for this specific request, which has now extended over two months, appear to be unduly excessive and go against the spirit of the legislation.\r\n\r\nTo recap, my request pertains to the provision of all the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022. It is disconcerting that this has led to such significant delays, and this pattern of delay suggests an unwillingness to comply with the law. As a concerned citizen and in the interest of public transparency, I am unable to accept these repeated postponements.\r\n\r\nPlease understand the gravity of this situation. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this non-commercial request contributes to an open and transparent discourse about our educational systems' approach to teaching the Holocaust. This is not a matter to be taken lightly or delayed further.\r\n\r\nAs such, I urge the North Colonie Central School District to expedite the provision of the requested information without further delay. I trust that your team can manage this request as a matter of priority, in respect of the provisions set by the New York Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nIf there are extenuating circumstances that have not been disclosed leading to these delays, please communicate these at your earliest convenience. My aim is to ensure due process, and I am willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable resolution, as long as the urgency and importance of this request are respected.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation. I look forward to receiving the requested documents soon.\r\n\r\n",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

The operation aimed to neutralize Japanese forces, capture strategic islands, and provide a platform for the launching of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers towards Japan.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nOfficial military reports, planning documents, and after-action reviews related to Operation Forager.\r\nCommunications, memos, or letters involving military commanders and personnel discussing the planning, execution, and aftermath of Operation Forager.\r\nAny photographs, maps, or other visual materials produced or collected during the operation.\r\nRecords of any investigations, inquiries, or tribunals associated with Operation Forager.\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received by the Reference Branch (RR2RR) on May 25,\r\n2023 with the assigned tracking number 23-44134.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have searched our holdings in Record Group 24: Records of the Bureau of\r\nNaval Personnel, Record Group 38: Records of the Chief of Naval Operations,\r\nRecord Group 127: Records of the US Marine Corps, Record Group 313: Records\r\nof Naval Operating Forces, and Record Group 407: Records of the Adjutant\r\nGeneral\u2019s Office and we were able to find relevant records for Operation\r\nForager for the Invasion of the Marianas, but we were not able to locate\r\nOperation Forager records for the invasion of the Palaus because they were\r\nunder a different operational designation \u2013 Operation Stalemate II in\r\nsupport of the Invasion of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to both Operation Forager and Stalemate II have\r\ndeclassified and are open and available to the public and they do not\r\nrequire a Freedom of Information Act request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 24, there are series relating to casualty files in Entries A1 3:\r\nWorld War II Casualty Reports and A1 1024: Casualty Information Reports\r\n[Ships, Stations, Units, and Incidents Casualty] arranged by ship or\r\nsquadron designation.  In Entry P 118-A1 and P 118-A2 are the deck logs of\r\ncommissioned US naval vessels during World War II arranged by the name or\r\nhull designation (if unnamed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 38, there are several series that might interest you including World\r\nWar II Action Reports and Other Operational Records (Entry A1 351), World\r\nWar II Operational Orders and Plans (Entry A1 352), and World War II War\r\nDiaries (Entry A1 353).  These series are arranged by naval hierarchy.\r\nThere are also the World War II Command Files (Entry UD-09D 19), and\r\nRecords of the Japanese Navy (UD-09D 23), and Records of the War Plans\r\nDivision (Entry A1 355).  The WWII Command Files has a broad selection of\r\nrecords arranged by naval hierarchy but unlike the Action Reports or War\r\nDiaries, these records are more subject files with different kinds of\r\nrecords from naval commands. The latter two entries have Staff Studies and\r\nfeasibility plans for the invasions of the different islands of the\r\nMarianas and the Palaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the materials you are looking for may be available on the National\r\nArchives Catalog in a digitized series of select World War II War Diaries\r\nand Other Operational Reports - https://catalog.archives.gov/id/4697018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 127, the primary series of interest would be Entry A1 1051: US Marine\r\nCorps World War II Operational Files (a. k. a. USMC Geographic Files),\r\nwhich are arranged by campaign, in which there are separate files for\r\nPeleliu, Guam, and Saipan-Tinian.Under each campaign, they are arranged by\r\nMarine Corps hierarchy including US Navy Amphibious Force records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 313, there are several series for \u201cFlag Commands\u201d of the US Navy\r\nincluding Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, 3rd/5th Fleets, 3rd/5th\r\nAmphibious Force and Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet.  These files are\r\nadministrative records and arranged by the Navy Filing Manual -\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/military/filing-manuals#navy The\r\nmaterials in RG 313 are more likely to include any files relating to Courts\r\nof Inquiry and Boards of Investigation (depending on who held the courts\r\nand boards) under their administrative files under filing designations\r\nA17-24 and A17-25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 407, there is the US Army World War II Unit Operational Records,\r\nwhich are arranged by US Army command in Entry NM-3 427.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are forwarding your request to the Still Photographs Branch for any\r\nphotographs that they may have regarding your topic.  They will send you a\r\nseparate response to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are forwarding your request to the Cartographic Branch for any maps and\r\ncharts that they may have regarding your topic.  They will send you a\r\nseparate response to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause these records are declassified and open and available to the public\r\nand also numerous in quantity, we would recommend that you or a researcher\r\nworking on your behalf visit our facility to review these records in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords in our custody contain a number of files that include information\r\non your topic.

Researchers are\r\nfurther encouraged to pre-register in advance of a visit. This process\r\nconsists of two parts, including completing the Online Researcher\r\nOrientation and Online Kiosk Registration.\r\n\r\n We do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request.

        "communication": "Good afternoon. Please be aware that with respect to your request for records concerning \"youth correctional facilities\" and \"juvenile detention facilities\", CYFD operates secure facilities for adjudicated youth only. Juvenile detention facilities are managed by the county and local governments, and there are currently four in operation in New Mexico: the Bernalillo County Youth Services Center (https://www.bernco.gov/youth-services-center/); the Dona Ana County Juvenile Detention Center (https://www.donaanacounty.org/departments/law-safety/detention-center?locale=en); the San Juan County Juvenile Detention Center (https://www.sjcounty.net/government/juvenile-services); and the Lea County Juvenile Detention Center (https://www.leacounty.net/p/departments/law-and-safety/detention-center).\r\n\r\nWith respect to your first question, Ruth Medina and Jenna Heller are our charge nurses at the J Paul Taylor and Youth Development Diagnostic Centers respectively; and Ralph Espinoza is deputy director for behavioral health at the centers. Ralph is out through the end of June; Ronnie Garcia is acting. Contact information for the facilities is available online at https://www.cyfd.nm.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Telephone_Directory_November_2022.pdf.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your second question, these are available online. Links to individual documents are found below this response.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your third question, our contracts for services are currently under review by legal counsel. This is a broad and burdensome request, and we require additional time to complete it (NMSA 1978 \u00a714-2-10). You may expect to hear from me on our progress by or before July 14, 2023.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your fourth question, the Medicaid and Medicare state agency for New Mexico is the Human Services Department. To submit a records request to HSD, please visit https://www.hsd.state.nm.us/public-information-and-communications/ipra-requests/. I have copied them on this response, and I recommend submitting a request directly.\r\n\r\nFinally, with response to your fifth question, I am not entirely clear what you are seeking. The appropriation of state general funds for the Department is found in the annual General Appropriation Act (commonly called House Bill 2) (for FY2023, available online here https://nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&legType=B&legNo=2&year=22; for FY2024, available online here https://nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&legType=B&legNo=2&year=23). If you could please provide additional information as to what you're looking for, that would be of great assistance.\r\nRules/Regulations\r\nChapter 14 Juvenile Justice\r\n\r\n8.14.1 Protective

This request pertains to communications, reports, plans, documentations, calendar entries, or agreements between the district and BOCES and or third parties regarding school climate surveys (i.e. EDSCLS) for the previous five years.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that certain requests might require time to process, I find it troubling that more than two months have elapsed without a satisfactory resolution. Even more troubling is the continuous extension of the \"anticipated completion date\", with the latest one set for June 16, 2023.\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of transparency and accountability in public service, I am deeply dismayed by the persistent delay and lack of responsiveness. The documents in question should be readily accessible, and I see no reasonable explanation for such a protracted delay.\r\n\r\nUnder the New York Freedom of Information Law, public bodies are obligated to respond to requests for public records in a timely manner. The continued postponement is contrary to the principles of this law and diminishes the faith in our public institutions' ability to uphold these basic standards of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I expect this situation to be rectified without further delay, honoring the principles of transparency and accountability that underpin the Freedom of Information Law.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\nI was forwarded your records request and I am attaching three files responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The spreadsheet is a list of arrests, criminal complaints/summons and citations regarding persons under 21 that occurred at addresses for Andover Public Schools and Greater Lawrence Technical School. Our records management systems do not currently track if the persons involved were students, or any disability status. Further, many of these actions may simply be motor vehicle stops that did not directly occur on school grounds but on the roadway alongside it. I could not limit searches to school grounds so I could only do based on address. The individuals aged under 21 is also not proof that someone is a student, but I am including them as potentials search matches. This data should go back to July 1, 2018 \u2013 we don\u2019t track by school year. We migrated to a new system in November 2021, so information prior to that is less complete than after.\r\n3.   While the data extract shows one arrest in February 2019, I can see that it was a motor vehicle stop on River Rd does not appear related to schools. In my opinion, arrests would be zero for the time periods referenced.\r\n5.   We do not track by school year but the extract has the dates.\r\n6. I am attaching two Memorandum of Understandings.\r\n7 and 8 \u2013 I could no immediately find records responsive to these portions of the request.\r\n\nMike Kirk<mailto:mike.kirk@andoverma.us>\r\nPublic Safety Application Architect / Records Supervisor\r\nAndover Police Department\r\n32 North Main Street\r\nAndover, MA 01810\r\n(P) 978-623-3521",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Marie Tamburro",
