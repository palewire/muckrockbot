Drug Para\r\n\r\nIF YOUR AGENCY DOES NOT USE BODY CAMERAS:\r\nIf you do not have a body camera video related to this incident, please let us know. We will likely cancel the request if your agency was not using BWC at the time of the incident. (Exception: State Troopers - we will still want state trooper dash cams.)\r\n\r\nEXCLUDED FROM THIS REQUEST:\r\nExclude any portion of footage involving personally identifiable information (PII)\r\nExclude portions of the video in which minors are visible\r\nExclude portions involving nudity, explicit or graphic content (blur, redact, or cut)\r\nExclude any other portion of the video at your discretion. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any consideration,\r\nAllison Wheeler | Volunteer",

Personnel continue to be off campus that we will need to work with to provide your information, as an initial cursory review has not been able to locate materials within your request.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions.\r\n\nJeffrey Herron",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing John \"Sonny\"\r\n    Franzese Sr. (February 6, 1917 \u2013 February 24, 2020), who was an\r\n    Italian-American mobster who was a longtime member of the Colombo crime\r\n    family.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me.

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/us/politics/joseph-i-lieberman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as\r\n    such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any\r\n    concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times\r\n    obituary at the following link:\r\n    https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/us/politics/joseph-i-lieberman-dead.html\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant\r\n    names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not\r\n    limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a\r\n    cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any\r\n    information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to\r\n    137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released\r\n    records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those\r\n    records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    If any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to\r\n    review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of\r\n    responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n    \r\n    I request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an\r\n    associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on\r\n    topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible\r\n    Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly,\r\n    and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Rather than handle this in the simple, straightforward and appropriate way that any good faith actor would, you chose to obstruct the process and create more work for your own offices, for seemingly no other functional reason than to delay the release of the materials and/or to annoy me (mission accomplished, expletives deleted indeed). \r\n\r\nOnce you open this request and re-locate the files, please connect me with the office's negotiation team, unless you'd like to waste more of your own personnel's \"valuable\" time.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires (lol).\r\n\r\nDelightedly yours,\r\n\r\nEmma Best",

I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method, and again, please release documents on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a reporter for Business Insider, and the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and if there are any questions about my request, can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me at email address. I am also happy to hop on the phone.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline",

While I will not be using these records for commercial purposes as stated in my initial request, I requested copies of notices issued by the City and did not request a list of names. Your interpretation led you to creating a list of names presumably because the original records are not available. Following how you interpret RCW 42.56.070 to apply to my request for City-issued notices, I would expect all public records requests that yield records containing multiple names to be subject to this law. If I were to ask for emails sent by the Mayor's Office (which I have many times without being required to sign an affidavit), you would argue that because multiple senders and recipients appear in the records, I must sign your affidavit. May I remind you that the PRA is to be \"liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the law you cite (RCW 42.56.070(8)) only applies to \"lists of individuals\". As seen depicted in this article, the letter is addressed to \"Fortuna Sequitur LLC\" which is the entity that runs the Bait Shop business. Nowhere in this letter do I see the name of any individual listed, so I do not see why the list you are creating would be deemed \"a list of individuals\".\r\nhttps://www.kuow.org/stories/graffiti-was-carved-into-their-windows-the-city-wants-these-seattle-bars-to-fix-it-or-pay-up\r\n\r\nI respectfully ask that I be provided the full breadth of requested information, as is my right under the PRA.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn November of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security amended the agency's Freedom of Information Act regulations under the guise of inter alia, \"streamlining the language of several procedural provisions\". See 81 Fed. Reg. 83625 (Nov. 22, 2016).  The new regulations impose requirements on requestors with respect to describing the records sought that are not found in the text of the Freedom of Information Act. They also allow ICE to administratively close FOIA requests where requestors fail to respond to the agency's assertion that the request is too broad. The regulations provide for no right of appeal of the administratively closure decision. \r\n\r\nFunctionally, these regulatory changes allow ICE to unilaterally assert that a request is too broad or not described with sufficient specificity to allow the agency to conduct a search for records, and then place the burden on the requestor to promptly respond or else have their request shunted into a bureaucratic limbo. In the event the administrative appeal is sustained and the request remanded back to ICE for processing, the agency's FOIA office essentially buys itself a second bite at the Act's timing requirements, with which it is already serially and egregiously non-compliant.\r\n\r\nThe experience of FOIA requestors post-November 2016 has been that the agency's updated regulations offered ICE's FOIA office a pretext to deny or administratively close request that the agency incorrectly and unlawfully characterizes as being \"too broad\".  When requestors have appealed the initial \"too broad\" determination, this determinations are almost uniformly reversed -- calling into question the process by which ICE FOIA makes the determination in the first place. Illustrative examples of this practice, with FOIA case numbers, are attached to this request. \r\n\r\nIn the context of a prior request for any ICE training materials or guidance for determining when a request is too broad, 2017-ICFO-29691, the agency simply directed the requestor to the text of the Freedom of Information Act and DHS's implementing regulations. \r\n\r\nDHS has not publicly disclosed the numbers of \"administratively closed\" requests in its annual reporting to DOJ and Congress. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of several media clients and non-profit organizations, I therefore request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any record showing the total number of initial \"too broad\" determination letters ICE FOIA sent to requestors during FY16-19. \r\n2. Any record showing the total number of responses by requestors within the 30-day timeframe set forth in ICE FOIA's \"too broad\" determination letters during FY16-19. \r\n3. Any record showing the total number of FOIA requests ICE administratively closed based on a requestor's failure to respond to the agency's \"too broad\" determinations during FY16-19. \r\n4. Any record showing the total number of administrative appeals  ICE FOIA received challenging the agency's \"too broad\" determinations during FY16-19. \r\n5. Any record showing the total number of remands of administrative appeals of ICE FOIA \"too broad\" determination during FY16-19. \r\n6. Any record showing the total number of FOIA lawsuits filed since November 22, 2016, challenging the agency's \"too broad\" determination, or its decision to administratively close a case for failure to respond to such a letter. \r\n7. Any training, guidance, checklist, template, or other document used by ICE FOIA to document the language in the FOIA request that falls short of the requirements set forth by DHS in 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b). \r\n8. Any communications, reports, dashboards, or modules demonstrating the total number of administratively closed FOIA requests currently pending before ICE based on a \"too broad\" determination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \nYour request has been assigned reference number 2020-ICFO-21220. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.

        "communication": "I hereby appeal the adequacy of the agency's search, and the legality of the agency's withholdings. \r\n\r\nFirst, ICE FOIA claims, incredibly, that it does not maintain records guiding FOIA officers on when a request is \"too broad\" under 6 CFR 5.3(b). This claim, if true, would establish a serious failure in the agency's training and supervision of its FOIA office, and is completely inconsistent with the agency's obligations under the Act. \r\n\r\nSecond, ICE FOIA contends that its 29-page response to Item 3 constitutes the only responsive record it has to this request. As an initial matter, ICE's failure to produce the records in native format (likely a .csv or .xls file) violates the Act. Substantively however, the agency's production of some 1100 requests it says the FOIA office closed as \"too broad\" under 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b) demonstrates why the agency's refusal to search for and produce records responsive to Items 1-2 and 4-8 cannot possibly be true. That's because the 29-page pdf does not contain the terms 'too broad\" or \"5.3(b)\", or any other term that would explain how these particular ~1100 records came to be designated as responsive to Item 3. Clearly, they were printouts from a system of records that ICE FOIA presumably queried. What was the basis for that query? How did that query produce these results? If ICE FOIA is to be believed that it doesn't track or maintain records responsive to Items 1-2 and 4-8, and that these 29 pages are the ONLY responsive documents that would be returned by a search reasonably calculated to lead to all responsive records, how can ICE FOIA explain the lack of any reference to the actual terms of Item 3 in the pdf if produced? \r\n\r\nPlease process this appeal within the period allowed by law and remand to the agency for re-tasking and re-processing consistent with the Act.",

You are seeking appealing the adequacy of the search and withholdings of records regarding several points concerning request deemed as \"too broad\" during FY 2016-2019. \n\nThese documents are on the ICE FOIA library  at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/manual-ICEFOIAIntakeSOP.pdf \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I am hereby submitting a Public Records Request for all money given from Northern Essex Community College to external vendors/suppliers in FY2015 through (and including) FY2024, a total of 10 years.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the data I am requesting include (but are not limited to):\r\n* all vendors, suppliers, individuals, and public-private partnerships\r\n* all materials, goods, services, properties, commodities, equipment leases, property leases, and licenses\r\n* all catalog orders, non-catalog orders, blanket orders, direct payments, bank card purchases, strategic sourcing, and competitive procurements\r\n* all auxiliary services purchases (starts in 2022, may be from a different accounting system)\r\n* all purchase orders, requisitions, and invoices\r\n* all products, goods, services, contracts, and subcontracts\r\n* all accounts, classes, commodities, and departments\r\n* regardless of the funding source\r\n\r\nI\u2019m requesting the data in a single Excel spreadsheet file (.xlsx format) with at least the following columns:\r\n* Amount\r\n* Supplier/Vendor Name\r\n* Account Description\r\n* Commodity Description\r\n* Fiscal Year\r\n* Department/Origin Description\r\n\r\nPlease report every expense, even if one or more of the above fields is blank. Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\n\na copy of all emails from the domain EOP.gov to senior managers encompassed within the required agency system for retaining emails of senior officials.  Frequently this records management policy/system is described by the name Capstone.\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs06-1-faqs.html\r\n\r\nIf the agency has not yet established NARA-compliant email retention procedures, then I instead request an electronic search of the mailboxes of agency senior managers for all emails that include the EOP.gov phrase in the FROM address.\r\n\r\nI limit this request to the time period January 20, 2017 to the present.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Best",

Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak",

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10 \r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan",

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798%252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850%252F%253Femail%253DEEA.RAO%252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE%3A1sTaIV%3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$>\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nMMCVXYVJ\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 151850\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798%252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850%252F%253Femail%253DEEA.RAO%252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE%3A1sTaIV%3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$>\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nMMCVXYVJ\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 151850\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798%252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850%252F%253Femail%253DEEA.RAO%252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE%3A1sTaIV%3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$><https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k*3Chttps:**Aurldefense.com*v3*__https:*accounts.muckrock.com*accounts*login**Anext=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$*3E__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJS8vLy8vLy8vPyoqKioqKioqKioqKioqKioqKiU!!CPANwP4y!UBixvChSzZuUs5KFozrknGGJ4UqV52lUKWbcYKLLr8QHeo8_2ISfFLwgSJ_9Zh0_J0Iw6qfhSY4t4hsTrU6ikJMM45bCFdUaIqw$>\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nMMCVXYVJ\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com%3cmailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 151850\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

Are you intending to start a new search or to use the results of these previous searches?\r\n\r\nI appreciate that it takes time to review records, so I remain happy to discuss modifications of search terms.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive
