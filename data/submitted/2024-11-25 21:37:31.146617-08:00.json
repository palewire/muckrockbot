G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1.

I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne.

Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4.

The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry or FBI association with a prominent Seattle-area boxer and associate of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party named Kenno Carlos. Kenno Carlos is deceased and thus privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. Mr. Kenno Carlos was born on November 28th of 1938 in Capitol Heights in Maryland, and died on December 29th of 2008. A photograph of his headstone and burial plot in the Forest Lawn cemetery in Seattle is available online: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/159350303/kenno-carlos\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd of 1968 Kenno Carlos was arrested in a flag burning episode in Seattle that made local news: https://www.historylink.org/File/1456\r\n\r\nAccording to evidence presented by the House Committee on Internal Security in 1970, Mr. Kenno Carlos of Seattle was included in a publicly released list of individuals, \"identified as Seattle Panther Party members or associates who, at various times between April 1968 and March 1970, participated in Panther functions regularly.\" A link to that document from the House Committee on Internal Security can be found here: https://blackfreedom.proquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blackpanther20.pdf\r\n\r\nOther known aliases for Kenno Carlos, according to the congressional report, include the names Joseph Edward Hall and Charlie Reno. In December of 1972 news articles describe Kenno Carlos boxing under the name \"Big\" Charlie Reno: https://www.boxingforum24.com/threads/ken-norton-vs-big-charlie-reno-december-13-1972.433709/ \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the boxer Kenno Carlos from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Kenno Carlos held by the Seattle office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Kenno Carlos.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases (including \"Joseph Edward Hall\" and \"Charlie Reno\"), nicknames (\"Big Charlie\"), code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Kenno Carlos.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Kenno Carlos. Possible bureau documentation on Kenno Carlos would likely include the flag burning episode and associated media coverage, Black Panther material and documents, etc. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together in having this request resolved. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

In most cases, your request will be processed in two to four weeks, or sooner.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City may invoke an extension of time to determine if there is a need to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search for and collect the requested records from field facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search for and examine a voluminous number of records.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Consult with another agency or City departments having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Compile data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your request is to review records (rather than receive copies), an appointment will be made with you for review once the records are gathered.\u00a0 Please note:\u00a0 If any responsive documents are copyrighted they can only be viewed in house.\u00a0 No duplicate or photos are allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a charge for the direct cost of duplication pursuant to the City\u2019s Book of fees. Payment must be made prior to release of records requested. If the documents requested exceed 50 pages, a deposit may be requested.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords available for review and/or copies of records requested will be available for 10 days after notification of their availability. If you are unable to pick-up or view your records during this time period, notification is required or your request will be considered fulfilled and a new request must be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain records are generally exempt for disclosure pursuant to Government Code Section 6255, where the public interest served by not making the records public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the records. The Government Code further provides that certain other records are specifically exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANET CHAPAN, MMC\r\n\r\n\r\nSr. Deputy City Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n1110 W.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally appeal the Department of Justice's response dated November 25, 2024, to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request concerning documents related to the DOJ's investigation of Nvidia Corporation's position in the AI chip market.\r\n\r\n+ Legal Basis for Appeal\r\n\r\nThe agency's blanket withholding of all requested documents under Exemption 7(A) is overly broad and fails to meet the specific criteria established by federal courts. In Mapother v. Department of Justice, 3 F.3d 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the court held that an agency must provide a \"substantially more specific\" justification for withholding documents than a generalized claim of potential interference with enforcement proceedings.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n1) Overbroad Application of Exemption 7(A):\r\n\r\nIn ACLU v. Department of Justice, 655 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court emphasized that Exemption 7(A) requires a demonstration of \"foreseeable harm\" from disclosure. The DOJ's response does not specify in detail how the release of each withheld document would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings. Without a detailed explanation, the exemption is improperly applied.\r\n\r\n2) Failure to Comply with the Segregability Requirement:\r\n\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b), agencies are required to release all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of requested records. In Founding Church of Scientology v. Smith, 721 F.2d 828 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court mandated that agencies must conduct a thorough review to segregate and release non-exempt information. The DOJ's blanket withholding suggests that no such effort was made.\r\n\r\n3) Misapplication of Other Potential Exemptions:\r\n\r\nWhile the DOJ cited Exemption 7(A), it did not address whether other exemptions might apply. Anticipating potential claims under Exemptions 4 or 5, I assert that the disclosure would not reveal trade secrets or privileged inter-agency communications, as the requested documents pertain to the agency's activities and not proprietary information from Nvidia.\r\n\r\n4) Compelling Public Interest\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), emphasized the critical role of transparency in maintaining an informed public. The investigation into Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market has significant implications for competition, consumer choice, and technological innovation.\r\n\r\nRecent reports have highlighted concerns about monopolistic practices and their impact on the economy and national security. Disclosure of the DOJ's investigative actions will enhance public understanding of how the government addresses these pressing issues, fostering trust and accountability.\r\n\r\n+ Requested Relief\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that the Office of Information Policy:\r\n\r\n1) Conduct a Document-by-Document Review:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), please perform a detailed review of each withheld document to assess the applicability of Exemption 7(A) on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n2) Provide a Detailed Vaughn Index:\r\n\r\nSupply a comprehensive index describing each withheld document, the exemption claimed, and a specific justification for its withholding. This will facilitate a meaningful review and appeal process.\r\n\r\n3) Release All Reasonably Segregable Information:\r\n\r\nDisclose all portions of the documents that do not meet the criteria for exemption, as mandated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\n4) Demonstrate Specific, Articulable Harm:\r\n\r\nClearly articulate how the disclosure of each specific document would cause foreseeable harm to enforcement proceedings, in line with the standards set forth in ACLU v. Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or clarifications, please feel free to contact me. I am willing to assist in any way to facilitate the processing of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKyle Wiggers",

(EIN: 81-0861541). Specifically, I am seeking:\r\n\r\nDetailed records related to the organization's lobbying expenditures as reported on Schedule C (Form 990, see attached) for tax years 2020 through 2023, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\na. Documentation detailing how the reported direct lobbying expenditures were allocated and spent.\r\nb. Information on specific legislation or representatives that were the focus of lobbying efforts.\r\nc. Records of grassroots lobbying activities and associated expenses.\r\nd. Any communications or records related to the organization's lobbying strategies and objectives.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation for the following specific expenditures reported on Schedule C:\r\n\r\n2020: $799,527 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n2021: $213,956 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n2022: $204,415 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n2023: $293,166 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n\r\n+ Legal Authority and Justification:\r\n\r\nThis request is supported by legal precedents emphasizing the importance of transparency in nonprofit organizations' lobbying activities:\r\n\r\nPublic Citizen Health Research Group v. Department of Health, Education & Welfare, 477 F. Supp. 595 (D.D.C. 1979): Established that records relating to nonprofit organizations influencing public policy are subject to disclosure under FOIA when they concern matters of significant public interest.\r\n\r\nNational Western Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 512 F. Supp. 454 (N.D. Tex. 1980): Supported the disclosure of IRS records pertaining to exempt organizations' activities affecting public policy.\r\n\r\nTax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607 (D.C. Cir. 1997): Affirmed that the public has a strong interest in records showing how tax-exempt organizations operate and influence public policy, necessitating disclosure unless records clearly fall under FOIA exemptions.\r\n\r\nMultiple Access Ltd. v. FDA, 591 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1979): Reinforced that federal agencies must disclose records unless they fall under specific FOIA exemptions. The requested information pertains to a 501(c)(3) organization's use of resources for lobbying activities, which is a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 360-61 (1976): The Supreme Court held that FOIA's basic policy of full agency disclosure supports the release of records unless they are exempt under clearly defined statutory language.\r\n\r\nLepelletier v. FDIC, 164 F.3d 37, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1999): Emphasized the public's significant interest in understanding how nonprofit organizations utilize resources to influence public policy, especially in emerging technology sectors.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it will contribute significantly to public understanding of how a prominent AI research organization utilizes its resources to influence policy in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. \r\n\r\n+ Format of Records:\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in electronic format (e.g., PDF or Word documents) where possible, preferably sent to my email address.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
