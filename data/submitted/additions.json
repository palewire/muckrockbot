Carter's family shared video footage of a trail camera showing Rasheem on a wooded trail near Taylorsville indicating that there is video footage. \r\n- Any emails to, from, and cc'ing Smith County Sheriff's Department head Charlie Crumpton that includes the keywords \"Rasheem Carter\" \"Carter\" \"Rasheem\" \r\n- Any emails to, from, and cc'ing Taylorsville Police Chief Gabe Horn that includes the keywords \"Rasheem Carter\" \"Carter\" \"Rasheem\" \r\n\r\nHuffPost reported that Smith County Sheriff's Department is overseeing the criminal investigation into Rasheem's death. Taylorsville Police Chief Gabe Horn told a local newspaper in December that Rasheem Carter filed a police report when he visited the station but declined to press any charges against whomever was threatening him.

The case is a matter of public interest given that the case has been unresolved at the moment, without a suspect in custody, and the case is under investigation.
