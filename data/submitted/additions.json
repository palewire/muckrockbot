I am looking into so called swatting attacks in California. Swatting involves when a suspect creates an emergency law enforcement response under false pretenses. Specifically I'm looking for incident reports, narratives, case files, and investigative reports related to any so called \"swattings\" in Kern County. Any emails, internal memos, presentations, or directives that mention \"swatting\" or are related to potential swatting incidents in the county. Responsive records can be from 2018 to the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
