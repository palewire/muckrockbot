Furthermore, there have been incredibly concerning instances of (3) non-LEOs dressing as LEOs who kidnap or attempt to kidnap residents in our community.\r\n\r\nAs a white, natural-born US-citizen, I respectfully submit this request to ensure the safety of the community where I reside, the State of Oregon, and individuals and communities impacted by these activities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
