Requests for Records \r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment  of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: armored vehicles such as Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAPs) vehicles, firearms, and night vision equipment. \r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII.                Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available. \r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255.  Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied. \r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to either John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983 or Nathaniel Phillipps, the Ristad Fellow at 559-994-3647.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "Hello MuckRock,\r\n On January 13, 2025, Clover Park School District received your request for public records. This letter serves as the district's initial response under RCW 42.56.520. You have requested the following:\r\n RCW 40.14.026(5)(l)\r\n(l) The estimated costs incurred by the agency in fulfilling records requests, including costs for staff compensation and legal review, and a measure of the average cost per request;\r\nRCW 40.14.026(5)(o)\r\n(o) The costs incurred by the agency with managing and retaining records, including staff compensation and purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests;\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n  1.  Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nAll identifiable records have been released. The district gathered the requested records from files maintained by Technology Services, legal fee and the public records staff.\r\n The charge for public records as follows:\r\n District Procedure No. 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the cost for producing copies of records includes the following:\r\n Cost of Printed Copies and Mailing\r\n\r\n  1.   Providing photocopies or printed copies of electronic records costs 15 cents per page.\r\n  2.  The district may also charge actual mailing costs, including the shipping container or envelope.\r\n\r\nCost for Electronic Records\r\n\r\n  1.  Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n  2.  Five cents per each of four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n  3.

The district\u2019s response to this request as the district considers this request to be fulfilled and closed. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of the district\u2019s response and records produced has started to run because the district does not intend to further address this request. The one-year statute of limitations means you have one year to challenge the district\u2019s response and responsive records released to you.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nAranka Holmes\r\n\r\nPublic Information and Records Coordinator\r\n\r\n[cid:59914212-7db2-40dc-8351-9f604850419a]\r\n\r\nCreating Promising Futures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Services Center\r\n\r\n10903 Gravelly Lake Dr. SW, Lakewood WA  98499-1341\r\n\r\n253-583-5083 \u2022  Fax 253-583-5088\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail message and all attachments, if any, may contain confidential and privileged material and are intended only for the person or entity to which the message is addressed.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKayla Fox\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nfox.kayl@northeastern.edu\r\n(312) 718-0331\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

When officers arrived, they attempted to reason with her, explaining that her father was not obligated to drive her. Despite multiple requests to exit the vehicle, Alexandria refused and was eventually removed from the car and placed under arrest. During the encounter, she made allegations against the officers and resisted arrest before being taken into custody.\r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who responded to this incident.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

We\u00a0anticipate a release of records before or around February 26, 2025.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, Next Request, the District's public records portal, simplifies the process of collection of large files, dissemination of large files, and tracking of requests, which reduces staffing costs for the District. As a result, the District has been waiving fees for most requests through the portal. If this changes or if the District deems that waiving fees is inappropriate, the District will provide affected requesters with notice of the change.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the Los Angeles  county district attorney's office use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the office use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the office aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the office used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the office\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

Public records requests are addressed by first in time and first in payment if advanced pay is required.  If a public records request is small in volume or contains little to no exemptions or confidential information for redaction, we may address it more quickly.  Your public records request is in the queue to be completed.  It will be completed in a reasonable time pursuant to Florida Statutes.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSUSAN S.

From your portal account you can review and download the records identified in response to your request. Please scroll to the bottom of your request, right before the message history to download the responsive records. \r\nFerry County Prosecutor Michael Golden has noted I have searched the physical offices, and staff has checked their computers. I have also searched the network drive for this office. The attached is the only \"list\" maintained by this Office under Brady or Giglio. We have materials sent to us by other agencies relating to potential Brady information on officers, and that information is maintained by this office, but there is no list of those materials -- they are maintained in a binder with no index or table of contents and no list of what's in there. Similarly, we receive emails regarding such information, but no list is maintained beyond what is attached hereto.\" \r\n\r\nAt this time, the County believes it has fulfilled your request and will close the above-referenced request file. If we have misinterpreted any part of your request; please advise as soon as possible, as it is the intent of staff to fully comply in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or have any difficulty in accessing the records, please do not hesitate to respond to this email through your portal account; or call the Ferry County Public Records Office at (509) 775-5225 ext 1107.

A copy of the Detainee Death Review (DDR) for Cristian Dumitrascu, who died at the CoreCivic Otay Mesa Detention Center on March 5, 2023. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrCristianDumitrascu.pdf. Please task a search of the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility External Reviews and Analysis Unit, as well as a search of the Executive Assistant Director responsible for custody operations\r\nB. A copy of the cover letter or findings memo ICE OPR sent when it circulated the Dumitrascu DDR.\r\nC. A copy of the Creative Corrections Health & Security Compliance Analysis ICE ERAU commissioned to prepare the DDR. \r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and in support of this request, attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge: \r\n1. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in the dissemination of information. \r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public about the circumstances of Mr. Dumitrascu's death. \r\n3. At least 7 people detained in the same area as Mr. Dumitrascu declared under oath that his care was delayed by CoreCivic staff. \r\n4. Multiple individuals detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death declared under oath that CoreCivic shut off telephone lines in the hours following his death -- preventing them from communicating what happened. \r\n5. At least one person detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death alleged CoreCivic and ICE accelerated the process of his removal in retaliation for attempting to share information about the death. \r\n6. CoreCivic facilities have previously been fined for negligence and contract violations that preceded deaths in ICE custody. See, e.g., https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24529304-stewart-contract-discrepancy-dec-2018. \r\n7. At least 55 deaths have occurred at CoreCivic's ICE facilities since 2003--more than any other ICE contractor. \r\n8. Since early 2017, ICE ceased affirmatively publishing detainee death reviews, forcing families to file FOIAs and sue when their loved ones die in order to obtain basic information on the government's findings. \r\n9. Congress recently approved the expansion of ICE detention by more than 20% -- up 7,500 beds to 41,500 funded. \r\n10. DHS and the present administration proposed cuts to inspection budgets for ICE detention centers, rendering the public less able to assess the lethality of ICE detention operations, including those at Otay Mesa.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making this request under 5 USC 552(a)(3), I demand release of this information pursuant to the Affirmative Disclosure obligations of 5 USC 552(a)(2).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 4/3/2024. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-ICFO-28663.

FEC (DC Cir 2013) (Kavanuagh, J.), the failure to supply an estimated date of production, and the failure to make records responsive to this request promptly available. \r\n\r\nWe request expedited processing of this appeal pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and state under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding. \r\n\r\nThere is an urgent need to inform the public of actual government contractor wrongdoing, based on recently released FOIA records documenting violations of multiple standards by facility staff in connection with Mr. Dumitrascu's death. Specifically, the ICE Health Services Corps concluded Mr. Dumitrascu's medical care deviated from safe limits of practice and violated facility policies and the contract with ICE. ICE has failed to disclosed these findings to the public, choosing instead to let stand its initial assurance following Mr. Dumitrascu's death that individuals in ICE custody receive access to 24/7 emergency medical care from the moment they arrived. IHSC's Mortality Findings prove this statement was untrue in the case of Mr. Dumitrascu, yet the public has not been made aware of it. The Detainee Death Review Report is a critical piece of information the public about the events preceding and following this death in custody. \r\n\r\nPlease grant expedited processing of this appeal, remand to the agency to make a determination and convey a date on which it expects to produce responsive records, and require the agency to make these records promptly available as required by law. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Your request was received in this office on\r\nDecember 4, 2024 and assigned FOIA tracking number RD 88034..\r\n\r\nYou requested access to the FBI file number 100A-BA-25222. My initial\r\nassessment is that the Baltimore Defense Committee is the subject of the\r\nrecords, compiled as part of a Domestic Security Investigation, created\r\nbetween September 1968 and February 1977, and consisting of an estimated\r\n1600 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA: https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\nThe estimated total page count for your request is1600 pages. Requests\r\nbetween 701 and 3,000 pages are assigned to our second-tier processing\r\nqueue. To give you an indication of our existing second-tier backlog, we\r\nare currently processing requests received in June 2014.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost, or order a digital\r\nor paper reproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per\r\npage, so we estimate the total cost will be $1280.00.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to narrow your request for a potentially faster\r\nprocessing time, please contact us to discuss narrowing options.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed. To change your contact\r\ninformation or to track the status of your request, please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov or call 301-837-3190. Please include your FOIA\r\ntracking number in all communications concerning this request.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request and would like the\r\nopportunity to discuss our response, you may contact our FOIA Public\r\nLiaison for assistance:\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Records \u2013 Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Requester Service Center: 301-837-3190\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison: Rebecca Calcagno\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\ndc.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n301-837-3190\r\n\r\nIf you have other questions regarding your request, please contact me\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou requested FBI case files related to Milwaukee Fourteen. We were unable\r\nto locate the case files 25-PH-41001 and 100A-MW-1581 that you inquired\r\nabout among the holdings of the National Archives and Records\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause we were unable to identify any case files pertinent to your subject\r\nof interest, we are closing your request administratively. This concludes\r\nthe processing of your request.\r\n\r\nSome FBI files are available online through the FBI\u2019s online vault at\r\nhttps://vault.fbi.gov/\r\n\r\nIf you have not done so already, you may wish to submit a FOIA request to\r\nthe FBI for a search of their indexes for files relating to your subject.\r\nInformation about how to submit a FOIA request with the FBI is available on\r\ntheir website at:\r\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/need-an-fbi-service-or-more-information/freedom-of-informationprivacy-act/requesting-fbi-records.\r\nYou may also reach them at their mailing address:\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nAttn: FOI/PA Request\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA 22602\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 2025 we received your request pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law for the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this department requires additional time beyond the 10 business days allotted under the law in order to respond to this request. The magnitude or difficulty of the request unduly burdens the other responsibilities of this small department. In particular, the enormous date range of 2018 through present 2025, (up until records are produced), and the sheer volume of reports that must be painstakingly scanned through as our small department has no way to segregate specific data as it relates to your request. As a result, the Department will do its best to produce the requested records within 25 business days following the initial receipt of your request, which represents a reasonable timeframe under the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our Town of Winchendon we service four public schools; Memorial School, Toy Town Elementary, Murdock Middle School and Murdock High School.  The town also currently services one private school, The Winchendon School and previously, a private school that was possibly funded publicly which is no longer in business, Cottage Hill Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo shorten the scope of your request, I am asking if you are also requesting these records for the private school, The Winchendon School and the private school Cottage Hill Academy, no longer in business.  I would not know if either of these schools report to DESE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that pursuant to 950 CMR 32.00 and G.L. c. 66, section 10A(a) you have the right to appeal this decision to the Supervisor of Public Records within 90 calendar days. Such appeal shall be in writing, and shall include a copy of the letter by which the request was made and, if available, a copy of the letter by which the custodian responded. The Supervisor shall accept an appeal only from a person who had made his or her record request in writing. Pursuant to G.L. c. 66, section 10A(c), you also have the right to seek judicial review by commencing a civil action in the superior court.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nMarla Watkins\r\n\r\nRecords Access Officer / Records Custodian\r\n    (Secondary)",

I wanted to bring to your attention that SUNY Maritime College has very limited staff and resources. Not all the items requested per the FOIL request are readily available records that can be easily produced. Some of the information (request #1b & #2b) needs to be  extracted from different sources and summarized. Also request #3, we can provide tuition by year, not by program. We can go through the request and provide you available records by February 7th.\r\n\r\nIf you're still interested in getting the other data (request 1b and 2b) which needs to be extracted and summarized, the College needs to take a staff who's working on other important jobs and specifically assign to this project which will take the staff approximately 3-4 hours to complete.  Per FOIL policy (please see below), if it will take more than 2 hours of staff's time, agencies are allowed to charge a fee.

Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the Department has previously provided data on crime incidents for 2009.

The officer's names and incident reports must include by law:\r\n\"information that must be made available to the general public includes: the time, substance, and location of the complaints or request for assistance; the time and nature of law enforcement\u2019s response; the time, date, and location of occurrence; the time and date of the report; factual circumstances surrounding the crime or incident; a general description of injuries, property and/or weapons involved; and the name and/or age of the victim (unless their identity must remain confidential under state law). \r\n\r\n- Dashcams, body cams, and any audio/video collected by your department related to these incidents must be included. \r\n\r\nThe law: \"Disclosure may be delayed for up to one year during an active criminal or administrative investigation, but only if the disclosure would substantially interfere with that investigation. \r\n\r\nAgencies must be able to produce audio or visual recordings while maintaining a reasonable expectation of privacy for those being depicted in the recording. Agencies are expected to use redaction technology that blurs or distorts images or audio. If an agency cannot adequately protect a subject\u2019s privacy with the use of such redaction technology, then it may withhold the entire recording. However, a copy must be made available to any person (or designated representative) whose privacy interest is protected by the public nondisclosure.\"\r\n\r\nI am aware this is a significant request. Please provide the reports to us in rolling production. I appreciate your assistance in advance and understand it may take time to fully release the records. \r\n\r\nThe names of those involved in the corresponding settlements are below.

Click the link below to retrieve the records.  Please note that the link works best with the Google Chrome browser, and any pop-up blockers need to be turned off. General Records Request - G009099-070824 This installment contains an index of all DAJD forms and an index of the Adult Division Policies and a Department wide index of policies (this one may include policies for Juvenile and Administration divisions). Per my message to you earlier today, under G009117, we do not have policies tied directly to the Corrections Officer positions, rather policies that may or may not be utilized by Corrections Officers. The same goes for forms, as there are over 1200 forms listed in the index and many of them may be used by Corrections Officers, but are not specifically for only Corrections Officers. If you could read through the indexes I have provided to you and get back with me on which Forms and policies you may want, I can begin to process them. If I hear back from you soon, I can have an installment ready for you by 8/14/2024. If I do not hear back from you by 8/14/2024, I will send another email asking for clarification on exactly which forms and policies you need. Please contact me if you have any questions.
