The custodian will determine whether responsive records exist, and if so, compile the records for your review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the due date located on the individual \"Request #\" page for an estimate of when your records, if any, will be available.\u00a0This estimated due date may be adjusted depending on the nature of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote also that records may be in active use at this time and therefore not available for immediate review.\u00a0Additionally, in accordance with the Louisiana Public Records Law, the City of New Orleans strives to promptly release all records which contain only public information and are not otherwise exempt from the Public Records Law. The City must balance its commitment to open access with its legal obligation to review public records for such exceptions and exemptions prior to release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that there may be a delay in responding to requests for email. Requests for email must first be sent to the City's IT Department to retrieve the requested emails. The emails must then be examined to determine if there is any material that must be redacted for privacy concerns and otherwise. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the custodian notifies our office that the records have been compiled you will be invoiced by email. Once you pay the invoice, you may download the records. Alternatively, you may schedule a time to review or purchase copies of the records.\u00a0Thank you for your request, and we look forward to working with you to provide public records in a fair and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCity of New Orleans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact City of New Orleans.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://nola.nextrequest.com/settings?id=1555081\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",

I request the disclosure of all LAPD and FBI records on Kim Porter, including her autopsy report, police files, and any other relevant documents.\r\n\r\nI make this request as a journalist on behalf of the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d My reason for wanting Kim Porter\u2019s files falls under \u201carticle 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5 (e)(1)(iv)\u201d as she was a public figure. And under \u201carticle 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5 (e)(1)(ii)\u201d I intend to write an article about the untimely death of Kim Porter, focusing on how she died and the controversy surrounding it. Reportedly, she had shared with friends credible threats to her life and was a victim of multiple domestic violence incidents. I understand that her family has suspicions regarding her death, which further adds to the importance of exploring the circumstances surrounding it. This information will be used in preparation for upcoming articles on my personal website. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I request the disclosure of all LAPD and FBI records on Kim Porter, including her autopsy report, police files, and any other relevant documents.\r\n\r\nI make this request as a journalist on behalf of the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d My reason for wanting Kim Porter\u2019s files falls under \u201carticle 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5 (e)(1)(iv)\u201d as she was a public figure. And under \u201carticle 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5 (e)(1)(ii)\u201d I intend to write an article about the untimely death of Kim Porter, focusing on how she died and the controversy surrounding it. Reportedly, she had shared with friends credible threats to her life and was a victim of multiple domestic violence incidents. I understand that her family has suspicions regarding her death, which further adds to the importance of exploring the circumstances surrounding it. This information will be used in preparation for upcoming articles on my personal website. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
