Donald Trump lobbied to have the city allow him to place it at one of his developments. Mayor Giuliani lobbied against the statue, and for the next 18 years it was offered to other cities. \r\n\r\nPlease search WHORM files for records related to Zurab Tsereteli and the late 1990s offer from the Russians for the statue. Keywords: Zurab Tsereteli, \u10d6\u10e3\u10e0\u10d0\u10d1 \u10ec\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8\r\n\r\nFor additional information: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/trump-files-donald-almost-built-gigantic-christopher-columbus-statue/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
