I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

Are there specific words/terms that should be searched, or is there a particular subject matter you are interested in? Even with the fairly narrow date range, the search could produce a number of records pertaining to a variety of subjects, and the responsive records will have to be reviewed individually for any confidential information that may be exempt from disclosure based on Iowa Code Chapter 22. In accordance with our fee schedule<https://transparency.uiowa.edu/faqs/public-records-fee-schedule>, we charge a rate of $30/hour, with one hour free, for the time to retrieve, review, and redact records. Please also note that we are processing a high volume of other requests at the moment, and requests for emails generally take longer for us to complete, due to the legal review required.\r\n\r\nPlease also be aware that if the search produces any records pertaining to personnel matters, those would likely be exempt from disclosure based on Iowa Code 22.7(11) (confidential personnel records).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to narrow the scope of your request, or if you want to proceed with your request as written. I will be in touch to let you know if there will be costs for the retrieval/review.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAubree\r\n\r\n\r\nAubree Johnson\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nThe University of Iowa\r\n351 Plaza Centre One\r\nIowa City, IA 52242\r\npublic-records@uiowa.edu<mailto:public-records@uiowa.edu>\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: THIS MESSAGE AND ANY RESPONSE TO IT MAY CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC RECORD, AND THEREFORE, MAY BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH IOWA PUBLIC RECORDS LAW, IOWA CODE CHAPTER 22.",

Gov't Code, which provides that an e-mail address of a member of the public that is provided for the purpose of communicating electronically with a governmental body is confidential and not subject to disclosure.  Additional redactions have been made per The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), where a student's identifying information appears within the records.\r\n\r\nSection 552.275 of the Texas Government Code authorizes a governmental body to establish a reasonable limit, not less than 15 hours for a one month period or 36 hours in a 12 month period, on the amount of time that personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies to a requestor, without recovering the costs attributable to the personnel time related to that requestor. Section 552.275 does not replace or supersede other sections, and it does not preclude a governmental body from charging labor for a request for inspection or copies for which a charge is authorized under other sections of this law.\r\n\r\nKeller ISD has established 15 hours in a one-month period and 36 hours per 12-month period as the reasonable limit on the amount of time personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies without recovering attributable costs. This 12-month period coincides with the District's fiscal year, which begins on July 1. Requestors who exceed the 36-hour time limit in a fiscal year (or 15 hours in one month) shall pay all costs attributable to cost of materials, personnel time, and overhead expenses necessary to comply with the request, even if the requestor intends to only inspect the documents.  For the 2023-2024 fiscal year thus far, the District has spent 1.0 hour(s) responding to requests you have submitted to date (since July 1, 2023) and provided you with the records gathered and compiled as a result.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the District's response to the March 13, 2024 request.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nKeller ISD Public Records\r\nP: 817-744-1000 | F: 817-744-1263\r\nwww.kellerisd.net<http://www.kellerisd.net/>",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

We received your request on September 8, 2020.  Your\r\nrequest concerns FBI files.\r\n\r\nThis office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for the National Archives\r\nand Records Administration's *operational *records (records created by this\r\nagency).  Your request is for *archival* records (records created by or\r\noriginated in a different agency, but that may have been transferred to the\r\nlegal custody of NARA) to which access is restricted.  Therefore, we have\r\nforwarded it to our *Office of Research Services, Special Access and FOIA*\r\nstaff who handle FOIA requests for such archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number, and respond\r\ndirectly to you.

Your request was received in this office on\r\nSeptember 3, 2020, and assigned FOIA tracking number 64611, interim\r\ntracking number RF-264.\r\n\r\nYou requested FBI records related to the following individuals: Robert\r\n\"Bobby\" James Fischer, Regina Wender Fischer, Hans-Gerhardt Fisher, Paul\r\nFelix Nemenyi, Peter Bjorn Nemenyi, Joan Fischer Targ, Aranka Nemeni\r\n(Aranka Heller).\r\n\r\nWe conducted a search of all available indexes transferred to the National\r\nArchives.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to identify any FBI case files at the National Archives\r\nrelated to Robert \u201cBobby\u201d James Fischer, Aranka Nemenyi (Aranka Heller),\r\nPaul Felix Nemenyi, or Joan Fischer Tar. It is possible that records\r\nrelating to these individuals are still in the custody of the FBI. If you\r\nhave not done so already, you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the FBI\r\nfor a search of their files for records relating to your subjects.\r\nInformation about how to submit a FOIA request with the FBI is available on\r\ntheir website at\r\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/services/records-management/foipa/requesting-fbi-records\r\n.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to locate any files on Hans-Gerhart (Gerardo, Girard,\r\nGerard) Fischer, however, the index indicated there may be documents which\r\nreference that name in file 100-HQ-138643, which is about the Soviet\r\nPurchasing Commission. The file consists of 112 sections, with an estimated\r\n24,000 pages. Based on our initial evaluation, this file is deemed\r\nunresponsive to your request because Hans-Gerhart Fischer is not the\r\nsubject of the file. Unless we receive a response from you within ninety\r\n(90) calendar days from the date of this letter to indicate you believe\r\nthese records are responsive, we will not include this file in your request.\r\n\r\nWe located the following files responsive to your request:\r\n\r\nWe identified Regina Fischer as the subject of the following files:\r\n\r\nFBI File 65-HQ-45667, created between October 1942 and November 1972, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 1400 pages.\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-NY-102290, created between December 1950 and March 1989, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 1000 pages.\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-WFO-27777, created between May 1953 and August 1961, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 100 pages.\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-CG-27015, created between April 1953 and March 1960, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 400 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe identified Peter Bjorn Nemenyi as the subject of the following file:\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-RH-10957, created between July 1969 and September 1969, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 15 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under the\r\nFOIA <https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine>:\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\nThe estimated total page count for your request is 2915 pages. Requests for\r\nbetween 701 and 3,000 pages are assigned to our second-tier processing\r\nqueue. To give you an indication of our existing second-tier backlog, we\r\nare currently processing requests received in June 2014.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $2,332.00.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed.

ShotSpotter representatives can be identified by searching the department's email system for addresses ending in \"@shotspotter.com.\" 2) All emails exchanges-including incoming messages, outgoing messages, forwards, and attachments-between the department's public information and/or media relations staff members and ShotSpotter representatives since January 1, 2021. ShotSpotter representatives can be identified by searching the department's email system for addresses ending in \"@shotspotter.com.\"\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA search located 94 pages of records, in the attached two files, responsive to this FOIA request.  Upon review, I have determined to withhold portions of the released records pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534 (a)(2), which exempts personal privacy information, the release of which would constitute a(n) (clearly) unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  The withheld information includes names/personal identifiers and other personal privacy information, including that which would lead to the identity of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no charges for FOIA services, in this instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this letter to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office  of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>.  Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Eckert\r\n\r\nFOIA Specialist\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Office\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n\r\nRobert.eckert@dc.gov<mailto:Robert.eckert@dc.gov>\r\n\r\n\"Excellence is transferable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month<https://nationaltoday.com/national-developmental-disabilities-awareness-month-2>.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA) has communicated, albeit without specific legal citations, that \"In 1945, the expenditure of public funds payable as dues to the Association was given a legal foundation in Education Law by the state Legislature.\" In light of this statement, I am seeking access to records under the New York State Freedom of Information Law that could provide clarification and documentation of this legal foundation. My request includes:\r\n\r\n-Legislative Documents: I am requesting copies of legislative documents, memoranda, or official notices from around 1945 that detail the authorization for school districts to use public funds for NYSSBA membership dues. This includes any legislative acts or amendments specifically enabling such expenditures.\r\n\r\n-Official Correspondence: I seek any official correspondence between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and NYSSBA, dating from 1945 to the current day, which discusses or references the legal basis for using public funds for NYSSBA dues.\r\n\r\n-Policy Documents: I am interested in obtaining any policy documents, guidelines, or bulletins issued by NYSED that address or relate to the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\nI recognize the importance of making my request specific and actionable. This request is aimed at accessing existing, identifiable records without requiring your department to undertake legal interpretation or generate new documentation.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the timeframe specified in my request, spanning from 1945 to the present, may present a broad scope that could potentially place an undue burden on your department. Therefore, I would like to emphasize my openness to partial responses. If locating documents from the entire period specified proves to be overly burdensome, I kindly request that the department prioritize the search and provision of documents from the following more focused timeframes, in order of importance:\r\n\r\n-Documents from the year 1945/1946 itself, given its specific mention in the context of providing legal foundation for school districts' expenditures on NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\n-Key documents from significant legislative or policy milestones related to this matter, should they be readily identifiable by your department.\r\n\r\nThis approach is intended to balance the need for thoroughness with practical considerations regarding the volume of records and the effort required to retrieve them. My goal is to facilitate a manageable and effective search process that aligns with both our interests in accessing relevant public records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if during the process of fulfilling this request, specific documents are identified that would substantially respond to the core of my inquiry, I am amenable to narrowing the scope further based on your suggestions. Your expertise and understanding of the department's records could provide valuable guidance in focusing this request more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Specifically, you request copies of any records that \"could provide clarification and documentation\" of the statute, including legislative documents, policy documents, and official correspondence.\r\n\r\nA diligent search was made for records responsive to your request, and the following records were located and copied:\r\n\r\n[1.] Governor's \"bill jacket\" for Laws of 1945, Chapter 92 (in State Archives record series 12950), which enacted what is now Education Law sect. 1618. The bill jacket contains a copy of the bill that was enacted, as well as comments on the bill. The jacket has been scanned, and a link to the digital file will be transmitted to you in a separate e-mail.\r\n\r\n[2.] Legal opinions of the Commissioner of Education relating to sect. 1618, found in 1 Education Department Reports 718 and 5 Education Department Reports 232. Digital copies of those published opinions are attached.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that after a diligent search, no \"policy documents\" or \"official correspondence\" concerning sect. 1618 were found in the correspondence and subject files of the Commissioner of Education that have been transferred to the State Archives by the State Education Department. Under my direction, staff searched the Commissioner's correspondence and subject files dating from 1945 through 2014, and no documents responsive to your request were located. More recent subject and correspondence files have not been transferred to the Archives.\r\n\r\nBecause no policy documents or official correspondence were located, you may appeal this partial denial of your request by sending a letter within thirty (30) days to Dr. Betty Rosa, Commissioner of Education, New York State Education Department, 89 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12234.

Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request within 90 to 120 days.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \nSorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience. \n\nSincerely, \nReNay Royster ReNay.Royster@treasury.gov FOIA@treasury.gov\n",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

These are reports where personnel have reached out to Shotspotter for support, because the system failed to detect a shooting or misclassified an incident. According to ShotSpotter, their best practices include steps to ensure that if police officers conclude the ShotSpotter alert was indeed a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d they report that the company to \"keep track and take remedial steps to minimize false positives in the future\". I am looking for any such feedback given to ShotSpotter. \r\n\r\n- Any emails between department staff with the words \"false positive\" and \"Shotspotter\" or \"shot spotter\" or \"sound thinking\". Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed. \r\n\r\n- Copies of all SoundThinking (Shotspotter) responses to aforementioned notification reports, Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed. \r\nThe City has located records responsive to your request.\u00a0 You can log into the system by clicking the following link and download your responsive records. \r\nPolice Public Records Request - P141315-103023\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience while we worked through this.\u00a0 Your\u00a0request will now be closed. \r\n\r\nRecords Section \r\nCincinnati Police Department",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: or any other emails corresponding to this individual including jaromeg@earthlink.com, .\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2000 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

All email discussions between Teri Paul, using any email, but specifically carpenter81321@protonmail.com and sundog2014@yahoo.com, and Lance McDaniel which may be cc'd or include other city employees.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2021 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. Please provide each deliverable 1-5, or itemize and concatenate as per the request order for pricing and delivery.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. Please provide this metadata and note that no per-page fee should be levied.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
