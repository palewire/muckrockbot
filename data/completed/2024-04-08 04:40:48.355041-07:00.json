The NSA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act (PA) divison treats all FOIA and PA requesters fairly by responding to each on a first-in, first-out basis in accordance with federal regulations.  Each request is unique; as such, there is no set timeframe for this process.  Each case that has responsive records goes through three levels of review prior to the final response.  The length of review in each phase depends on many factors, such as the number of pages and classification level.\r\nPlease be advised that there are a significant number of FOIA requests ahead of yours in the FOIA backlog queue, such that we are unable to provide an estimated date of first level review at this time.  A letter will be sent from the NSA FOIA/PA division once a case moves to the next phase of processing.\r\nNSA Freedom of Information Division\r\n(301) 688-6527\n",

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including bank account numbers, EINs of nonpublic entities, and other highly personal information. Section 7(1)(b) exempts from release \u201c[p]rivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b). Section 7(1)(c) exempts from released \u201c[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.\u2019\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c). Further, names of parties protected by court order were redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(a) of the FOIA, which exempts from release \u201c[i]nformation specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing federal or State law.\u201d 5 ILCS140/7(1)(a). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Please note these invoices have been redacted in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m). The CPS FOIA Office has been informed that there are no records responsive to the portion of this request seeking \u201c letters of engagement\u201d within the timeframe of this request.

At this time, production work related to your public records request remains underway, and it is not possible to estimate how much longer that work may take.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records Law, Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 19.31 to 19.39, authorizes requesters to inspect or obtain copies of \u201crecords\u201d created or maintained by an \u201cauthority.\u201d Records are presumed to be open to public inspection and copying, but there are exceptions. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.31. Statutes, the common law, and the public records law balancing test, which weighs the public interest in disclosure of a record against the public interest in nondisclosure, provide such exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhen DOJ receives a public records request, DOJ must search to identify responsive records. Once records are located, DOJ must review each record to determine if all or part of the record cannot be disclosed pursuant to statute, the common law, or the balancing test. This process can take substantial time to complete, especially for complex files or records.\r\n\r\nDOJ receives a high volume of public records requests and, to the extent possible, works to process them in the order in which they are received. Presently, we have a large number of requests received prior to yours that remain in progress, too.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured that DOJ continues to process your request. If you wish to check on the status of your request in future, or if you wish to discuss your request, please contact our office.\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D83895.7FAFF470]\r\nState of Wisconsin Department of Justice\r\nOffice of Open Government\r\n17 W.

Because payroll information contains protected employee information such as social security number, it will take us additional time to redact or remove the protected information from the responsive documents.\r\nAccordingly, we estimate it will take approximately 45 to 60 days to produce the documents to you for years 2009-2022.\r\nWe estimate it will take approximately 6 to 9 months to find and produce archived documents that would be responsive to the part of your request that includes years 1984-2009.\r\nPlease confirm if you still want to receive documents from 1984-2009 within that time frame.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRose\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D98253.C2F73E60]\r\nRose Bell\r\nDirector of Community Relations and Communications\r\nPronouns: she/her\r\nA guest on traditional Pomo land\r\nO: 707-468-3012\r\n1000 Hensley Creek Rd. | Ukiah, CA 95482\r\nA proud Hispanic-Serving Institution\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D98253.C2F73E60]<https://www.instagram.com/mendocinoeagles/?hl=en>  [cid:image003.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://www.facebook.com/MendocinoCollege/>   [cid:image004.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://twitter.com/MendocinoEagles>   [cid:image005.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://www.youtube.com/user/mendocinocollege/featured>   [cid:image006.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://www.linkedin.com/school/mendocino-college/>\n",

        "communication": "At the February 27, 2024 Oak Park Public Library board meeting, a community member made a public comment regarding inconsistent treatment for a FOIA request [1]. Nearly identical requests were made but the responsive records were heavily redacted only for one person.\r\n\r\nIn our FOIA on March 5th [2] and March 8th [3] we saw inconsistency in the FOIA process validating community concerns.\r\n\r\nOn March 16th The Oak Park Public Library Board of Trustees published a statement [4] promising:\r\n\r\n\u201cAn analysis of the Library\u2019s FOIA policy and current practices to affirm that they are consistent and responsive.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the The Oak Park Public Library Board of Trustees meeting on Tuesday March 26th [5], board President Matthew Fruth apparently reported the results of the analysis:\r\n\r\n(paraphrased from audio transcription)\r\n\u201cI want to make a quick comment about some of the FOIA questions recently. I received, one of co-acting interim director Suzy Wulf, myself, and trusty Ganguly about the handling of some of the the FOIA request in question and informed us that the the one that was not redacted was the one that was provided and and reviewed by her and the one that was redacted was one that she had questions about and referred to our attorney, and the attorney provided those redactions in response to the FOIA in question. I want to make sure that it's very clear that those redactions were done by our Council and not by Miss Wulf. She followed our procedures and was acting in best accordance with the first FOIA that came across her desk and then did what she thought was responsible and forwarded to our attorney a second that was received later for them to review and they provided those redactions. So I would like to make sure that that is out there and hopefully to put that question to rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn March 27th the Wednesday Journal reported [6]:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother incident that may be under investigation is the library\u2019s distribution of FOIA request responses. Two residents submitted FOIA requests asking for the same information. One came back with little to no redactions, and the other had many. \r\n\r\nFoss said the FOIA that was not redacted was reviewed and provided by Wulf. The one that was redacted was one Wulf \u201chad questions about,\u201d he said, and an attorney provided redactions, not Wulf. \r\n\r\n\u201cShe followed our procedures and was acting in best accordance with the first FOIA that came across her desk,\u201d he said. \u201c[She] did what she thought was responsible and forwarded to our attorney a second [FOIA].\u201d \r\n\r\nThat still does not address concerns regarding why two nearly identical requests were treated differently. To that effect we hereby request the following records pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.:\r\n\r\n***Any and all communication records (including but not limited to hard-copy documents, memos, emails, word processor documents, PDF documents, etc.) generated between January 1, 2024 and the date this request is processed (inclusive of those dates) sent between Oak Park Public Library staff Suzanne Wulf and any attorney of Oak Park Public Library.***\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNiles Coalition\r\n\r\n\r\nCITATIONS\r\n[1] OakParkPublicLibrary Youtube video: \u201cBoard of Library Trustees Regular Meeting: February 27, 2024, part 1\u201d <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtRSjF2ihHw&t=1926s>\r\n\r\n[2] Niles Coalition FOIA on Muckrock: OPPL FOIA Logs 2023-2_2024 <https://www.muckrock.com/foi/oak-park-il-5511/oppl-foia-logs-2023-2_2024-159840/>\r\n\r\n[3] Niles Coalition FOIA on Muckrock: OPPL FOIA Response Docs 2023-2_2024 <https://www.muckrock.com/foi/oak-park-il-5511/oppl-foia-response-docs-2023-2_2024-16005>\r\n\r\n[4] Webpage published on oppl.org: \u201cAn Important Message from the Oak Park Public Library Board of Trustees\u201d <https://web.archive.org/web/20240322094159/https://www.oppl.org/news-events/announcements/an-important-message-from-the-oak-park-public-library-board-of-trustees/>\r\n\r\n[5] OakParkPublicLibrary Youtube video \u201cBoard of Library Trustees Regular Meeting March 26, 2024\u201d <https://youtu.be/AHWLWmauu2E?t=1783>\r\n\r\n[6] Wednesday Journal: \u201cOak Park library board begins search for executive director\u201d <https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.oakpark.com/2024/03/27/oak-park-library-executive-director-search/>",

If you have a sample copy of those conditions of probation, this is what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nWendy",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent 56 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. No new or additional redactions have been made to this particular installment of records, and the responsive records appear just as they did when provided to the original requester. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email.

Accordingly, if we do not hear from you by February 7, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, you must click the link and either download the files or click on the files to open them, and you must notify us that you have accessed the files or that you are unable to access the records made available to you no later than February 7, 2022. Again, if you fail to respond to this notification by that date, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before February 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image004.png@01D803D0.B1CB20F0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a second installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional 36 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (the original requester was the parent of the student whose education record it was). An Exemption Log for this record is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, these records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below. As requested, this is a public link and is not password protected.\r\n\r\n[\u200bFolder icon] Public Records Request \u2013 MuckRock PRA Audit<https://epscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/09566_apps_everettsd_org/ErZyFIvyVTBNqV9mmDkx-sEBSOkFAxLiwaKniCabzzGOWw?e=9lNHuO>\r\n\r\nThe system will not notify us when you access your records. Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nWe have yet received a response from you verifying receipt of our last installment provided on January 7, 2022. We are providing an additional opportunity for you to respond to our notifications that an installment of records has been made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by March 14, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, as we have not heard from you since your original request was made and we have not received confirmation of your receipt of the January 7, 2022 installment, we have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation of receipt of both installments provided to date. Upon such confirmation, the anticipated date for the next installment of records will be provided. Otherwise, your request will be deemed abandoned without further action as noted above.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D81F49.72D49E00]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

This installment represents one of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district\u2019s response to that request. While this installment contains only one request, it was a large request that took many months to fulfill. Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. The detailed redaction/exemption logs, as they were provided to the original requester, are included. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, these records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below. As requested, this is a public link and is not password protected.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request \u2013 MuckRock PRA Audit<https://epscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/09566_apps_everettsd_org/ElXAf7ErlKVImKD_IAMyMH4B_Ms8oDse0n_mjePZU2dECw?e=uOB7mN>\r\n\r\nThe system will not notify us when you access your records. Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by May 22, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, if receipt of the current installment is confirmed by the aforementioned deadline, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before May 27, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8563D.1954A0C0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, your request is deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records sent to the Superintendent, Ian Saltzman, on Tuesday, March 19, 2024, which was subsequently sent to the public records office for handling the same day. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, we seek the following clarifications of your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The appears to be a follow up to your most recent request which had a date range of January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Your renewed request reverted back to the initial date range ending November 4, 2021. Please clarify and confirm the date range of your request. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with the date range provided in your request today, for records between January 1, 2010, through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  In your former request for records, received by the district on October 9, 2023, you noted that \"Installments of Records previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Please clarify if this statement remains true, or if you would like us to produce installments previously provided to you again. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with your request as worded, and will reproduce any records responsive to this request that may have previously been provided. Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed.

State and local agencies that spent less than $100,000 may voluntarily submit reports (RCW 40.14.026(5)).\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2021 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2020.

Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n6.\tProvide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2019 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the review of body camera data by supervising officers or staff or civilian review personnel to ensure officer compliance with department or agency policies and applicable state and federal law;\r\n\r\n3. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the storage of data obtained using body cameras, including:\r\n  a. where the data is stored;\r\n  b. how long data is stored;\r\n  c. when data must be discarded; and\r\n  d. how much data your agency or department currently stores;\r\n\r\n4. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning access to body camera data, including:\r\n  a. the legal justification required before a law enforcement employee or member of the public may access body camera data;\r\n  b. purposes for which the data may be accessed;\r\n  c. purposes for which the data may not be accessed;\r\n  d. who may access the data, what procedures they must go through to obtain access, and who must authorize access; and\r\n  e. the existence of a system that records who accesses the data and when the data is accessed;\r\n\r\n5. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the sharing of data obtained through body cameras, including:\r\n  a. what type of data is shared;\r\n  b. what databases your agency puts collected body camera data into; and\r\n  c. third parties, governmental or private, that may access your agency's body camera data, including what procedures a third party must go through to access the data and any restrictions placed on a third party regarding further sharing of your body camera data;\r\n\r\n6.

All training materials used to instruct members of your department or agency in body camera deployment, data management, or operation of automated records systems that contain body camera data to which any member of your department or agency has access, including regional or shared databases.\r\n\r\nIf this records request is denied in whole or in part, please provide (1) whether the documents in question exists, and if so, (2) the statutory exemption you are claiming prevents their release. If Rankin County Sheriff's Office claims an exemption for some of the requested documents, please produce those for which it does not claim an exemption, including records where the exempt portions are redacted. \r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents will be made available to the general public, this request is not being made for commercial purposes, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, I am requesting a waiver of any fees for searching or copying these records.

If such a spreadsheet can be produced from the Department's accounting software showing amount of payment, date of payment, payee, and description of reason for payment, then I am requesting that spreadsheet. Please cover a period going back to 2012,\" the City Clerk Department has compiled the following response:\r\n\r\nCalifornia Government Code Section 7922.535 requires the City to provide a response to your request within 10 days of receipt indicating what, if any, of the documents sought will be disclosed. Government Code Section 7922.535 also permits the City to extend the period in which it responds to your request by an additional 14 days, if necessary. The City is requesting an extension because the City needs to compile and filter the data generated from a voluminous report through our financial software. As an example, the reports for FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 produced an excess of 1400 pages that need to be converted to excel and then filtered by department.  Once the records have been gathered, there will also be an examination to determine if any of the records are exempt from disclosure. A determination regarding your request will be sent to you no later than April 12, 2024, which is 14 days from the tenth day following the City's receipt of your request.\r\n\r\nIn the event the documents are collected and examined, and a determination on their disclosure is made prior to that time, we will provide you with that determination sooner. If you have any questions, please contact the City Clerk Department at (562) 567-9850.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01DA8464.D542ECE0]<http://www.cityofwhittier.org/> City Clerk Department\r\n13230 Penn St. | Whittier, CA 90602\r\n(562) 567 - 9850 | Email: ccd@cityofwhittier.org<mailto:ccd@cityofwhittier.org> | www.cityofwhittier.org<http://www.cityofwhittier.org/>\r\nGo Green!

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)).

The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(p) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[r]ecords relating to collective negotiating matters between public bodies and their employees or representatives, except that any final contract or agreement shall be subject to inspection and copying.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(p).

Contents of emails and attachments highlighted on attached email log released via FOIA N014773-020124. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including race/ethnicity, cell phone numbers, personal email addresses, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Course materials or research materials used by faculty members have been redacted pursuant to section (j)(iv) of the FOIA. 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iv). Redactions have been applied pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(p) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[r]ecords relating to collective negotiating matters between public bodies and their employees or representatives, except that any final contract or agreement shall be subject to inspection and copying.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(p). Finally, please note that records that do not pertain to the transaction of public business have been withheld from release. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\n\nFor ANY AND ALL canine use within the Fitchburg Public Schools between August 1, 2018 to the date of receipt of this FOIA request, please provide:\r\n\r\n    1) the DATES, TIMES, AND DURATION of the canine use; and\r\n    2) LOCATION of the canine use, as specific as possible (for example, if a canine search was limited to a bathroom then the school and room number; or if a canine search was performed on all lockers but did not extend into any classroom, then that should be noted); and\r\n    3) the REASON(S) for the use; and\r\n    4) the LEGAL JUSTIFICATION for the reason(s) for the use, citing statute and/or case law if possible; and\r\n    5) the NAME OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT(S) involved in the canine use, including but not limited to any police department present during the canine use even if that police department was not the owner or handler of the canine(s); and\r\n    6) if the canine(s) is owned by a police department, the NAME(S) AND BADGE/ID NUMBER(S) of the canine(s) involved; and \r\n    7) if the canine(s) is NOT owned by a police department, the name(s) of the canine(s) involved, and the name, address, phone number, and email of the OWNER of the canine(s); and \r\n    8) if the canine(s) is NOT owned by a police department, the name(s) of the HANDLER(S) of the canine(s); and \r\n    9) if the canine(s) is NOT owned by a police department, any and all contracts, memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, and any other official contract concerning the canine(s) and police department requesting the canine(s) use; and\r\n    10) THE NAME(S) AND BADGE NUMBER(S) of the police department employee(s) involved; and the name(s) of the Fitchburg Public School ADMINISTRATOR(S) AND OTHER EMPLOYEES in charge of the canine use, including but not limited to any school employee who made the request, directly monitored the canine usage, or who otherwise acted as a school representative concerning the canine use; and\r\n    11) any and all RESULTS of the canine use, including but not limited to non-productive searches; and\r\n    12) if the canine use was requested or required by the Fitchburg Public Schools, the name of the Fitchburg Public School employee REQUESTOR(S); and\r\n    13) if the canine use requested or required by the Fitchburg Police Department, the name of the Fitchburg Police Department employee REQUESTOR(S).\r\n\r\nThe term \"canine\" is intended to mean a police-owned or police-commissioned dog that is utilized for searches or other police functions within schools. Police functions also includes but is not limited to:\r\n- searches\r\n- demonstrations\r\n- teaching\r\n- training\r\n- any other ancillary police function\r\nas long as the canine use was performed in the Fitchburg Public School, on Fitchburg Public School owned property, and/or requested by the Fitchburg Public Schools.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this FOIA request is for the records produced or maintained by each department (for example, the Fitchburg Public School district, or the Fitchburg Police Department, and not simply one school within the system or one police building). Therefore this information must be from each department's records, and not coordinated with any other department, entity, agency, or group, unless that outside department's normally stores or maintains records for that department. For example, the school can provide a police report which the school has on file prior to this public records request, but should not request a police report from a police department solely in order to fulfill this public records request.\r\n\r\nFees for public records requests are defined in part in Massachusetts law 950 CMR 32.07 (2)(m) for municipal records and 950 CMR 32 (2) in general.\n\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNeal Delfeld\n\n",
