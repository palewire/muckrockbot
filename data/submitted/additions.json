        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to Frederick Leonard Ahearn. He was born on 6 November 1949 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He died on 14 November 2023.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\nMr. Ahearn was a Republican White House official, political consultant, executive branch appointee, and campaigner. He worked for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Steve Forbes, Rudy Giuliani, and Donald Trump, as well as for several Vice Presidents. He served as the lead \"advanceman\" for President Ronald Wilson Reagan, and he was present at John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt on the President's life. Ahearn worked as regional representative of the U.S. Secretary of Labor, Raymond Donovan. He was also a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ahearn served as a campaign manager for a Ukrainian pro-Russian political party, the Party of Regions, in 2006. \r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Brown appeared in numerous national media, including NPR, https://www.npr.org/2023/05/19/1118051361/nfl-hall-of-fame-cleveland-browns-running-back-jim-brown-dead, the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/sports/football/im-brown-dead.html, and ESPN (see attached).\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Ahearn:\r\n\r\n(1) Ronald Wilson Reagan\r\n(2) John Hinckley Jr.\r\n(3) Party of Regions (Ukraine)\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn was a public figure. He was a key figure in Republican presidential politics for over half a century, and he was present at one of the most dire moments of the Reagan presidency, when the President was shot by John Hinckley Jr. Thus, a broad segment of the public will likely be interested in these records.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
