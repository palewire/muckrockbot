See A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, p. 32, n.115.\u00a0 It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records with respect to responses to public records requests.\u00a0 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u00a0 Specifically, you stated: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll emails, attachments, or records of crime statistics sent to or from any of the following individuals, from January 1, 2023 to the present: \r\n\r\nJoseph Narduzzo (joseph.narduzzo@pd.boston.gov) \r\n\r\nRobert Ciccolo (robert.ciccolo@pd.boston.gov) \r\n\r\nShawn Burns (shawn.burns@pd.boston.gov) \r\n\r\nSuperintendent-In-Chief Phillip Owens \r\n\r\nPolice Commissioner Michael Cox \r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to: \r\n\r\nStatistical summaries or compilations of crime data; \r\n\r\nWeekly or monthly incident reports; \r\n\r\nCOMPSTAT reports or briefings; \r\n\r\nInternal crime dashboards, charts, or spreadsheets; \r\n\r\nAny crime data prepared for or discussed in command staff meetings; \r\n\r\nAny related emails or documents forwarded, received, or sent by these individuals that include or attach crime statistics. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

The Public Records Law requires that the request provide a reasonable description of records sought.  See G.L. c. 66,  \u00a7 10(a)(i).  In Chawla , the superior court found that under the Public Records Law \u201cthe reasonable description requirement contemplates that a requesting party will identify documents or categories of documents with sufficient particularity that government employees will be able to understand exactly what they are looking for, and then make a prompt production.\u201d  See Jaideep Chawla v. Dept. of Revenue , Suffolk Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019).  The Court further indicated that \u201crequests for documents that are articulated with very broad language that calls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently related to the category of materials requested, will not (emphasis added) satisfy this statutory standard.\u201d Id. In addition to the requirement that the request identify with specificity the records sought, the requester also must act in a reasonable manner so as not to overburden the public entity with complying with the request. See Friedman v. Division of Administrative Law Appeal and Bureau of Special Education Appeals, Suffolk Sup. No. 2284CV02061-C, at 3 (February 14, 2023). Although you identify the records that you are looking for, this description does not meet the statutory standard that records be identified with sufficient particularity.\u00a0 The description you provide is too broad and vague.\u00a0 You are requesting \u201call police files associated with the arrests and investigations into Albert DeSalvo\u201d .\u00a0The Department would need to locate these records and review to determine responsiveness.\u00a0 This would require administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently related\u00a0 to the category of materials requested; therefore, this request does not satisfy the statutory standard of reasonable description of records.  See Chawla, Suffolk Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2. In Freidman, the Court focused on the reasonableness standard contemplated throughout the Public Records Law.\u00a0 The Court recognized that the reasonable description requirement is necessary under the Public Records Law because the intent of the law \u201cwas not intended to reduce government agencies to full-time investigators on behalf of requestors.\u201d Friedman quoting Assassination Archives & Research Ctr., Inc. v. Central Intelligence Agency, 720 F. Supp. 217, 219 (D.D.C. 1989).\u00a0 This request is seeking all police files relating to the arrests and investigations into Albert Desalvo from the 1950s to the present day.\u00a0 This is too burdensome for the Department to meet the \"reasonably describes\u201d requirement.\u00a0 In addition to reviewing the files to determine responsiveness, the Department would need to review all the records to see if there is anything that needs to be redacted under statutes such as juvenile information, arrests involving minors, Criminal Offender Record Information, or incidents related to sexual assault.\u00a0 The Department will also need to review the records to see if there is any personal identifying information related to specific individuals or anything identifying potential witnesses which may need to be removed under Exemptions C and F under the Public Records Law. Your request does not comply with the Public Records Law because the request is seeking records that are articulated with broad language and it does not describe the records with sufficient particularity.\u00a0 It is unclear what specific records you are requesting. Therefore, the request does not comply with the reasonable statutory standard and is burdensome on the Department.\u00a0 This request will be closed. We encourage you to consider narrowing your request.\u00a0 You may wish to modify or clarify your request to provide sufficient particularity, including narrowing the time period or identifying specific incidents to enable the search to be processed. In the event the City were able to determine the intended scope of your request, it is likely the City would have to provide a fee estimate given the likely volume of the potentially responsive records and the need for redaction or segregation of those records. Should you seek specific records I encourage you to visit the City's public records portal. https://bostonma.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(4ihmrhaxyjn0l4fkagn2d4jn))/supporthome.aspx Accordingly, this request is now closed.\u00a0 You may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition).

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage. \n\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \n\nSincerely, \n\nBrian McCarter \n\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fboston-police-department-174%252Fcrime-statistics-emailed-to-bpd-command-staff-188165%252F%253Femail%253Dshawn.williams%252540boston.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj3diGLiMEHhZ1lqStA9sjze0%3A1uRjs4%3AOZ59-9eMhU1ObY9syUBgigbNeUCfJIIoRgTGXOq0wlM The Department provided you with a response on June 18, 2025 and denied your request.\u00a0 The Department denied your request because it did not meet the requirements of particularity, specificity, or reasonableness and cited the Chawla and Friedman cases. See Jaideep Chawla v. Dept. of Revenue , Suffolk Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019) and See Friedman v. Division of Administrative Law Appeal and Bureau of Special Education Appeals , Suffolk Sup. No. 2284CV02061-C, at 3 (February 14, 2023). The Department inadvertently confused your request with another request.\u00a0 The Department is denying your request because it does not comply with the Public Records Law; however, the Department is revising its response and providing clarification that relates to your request herein. \nYour request does not comply with the public records law because it is overly broad and vague.\u00a0 The Public Records Law requires that the request provide a reasonable description of records sought. See G.L. c. 66,\u00a0 \u00a7 10(a)(i).\u00a0 In Chawla , the superior court found that under the Public Records Law \u201cthe reasonable description requirement contemplates that a requesting party will identify documents or categories of documents with sufficient particularity that government employees will be able to understand exactly what they are looking for, and then make a prompt production.\u201d See Jaideep Chawla v. Dept. of Revenue , Suffolk Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019).\u00a0 The Court further indicated that \u201crequests for documents that are articulated with very broad language that calls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently related to the category of materials requested, will not (emphasis added) satisfy this statutory standard.\u201d Id. In addition to the requirement that the request identify with specificity the records sought, the requester also must act in a reasonable manner so as not to overburden the public entity with complying with the request. See Friedman v. Division of Administrative Law Appeal and Bureau of Special Education Appeals , Suffolk Sup. No. 2284CV02061-C, at 3 (February 14, 2023). Although you identify the records that you are looking for, this description does not meet the statutory standard that records be identified with sufficient particularity.\u00a0 The description you provide is too broad and vague.\u00a0 You are requesting all emails and attachments, or records of crime statistics sent to or from certain individuals at the Department from January 1, 2023 to the present . The records that you are requesting involve the following individuals:\u00a0 Joseph Narduzzo ( joseph.narduzzo@pd.boston.gov ); Robert Ciccolo ( robert.ciccolo@pd.boston.gov ); Shawn Burns ( shawn.burns@pd.boston.gov ); Superintendent-In-Chief Phillip Owens; Police Commissioner Michael Cox.\u00a0 You also identify search terms in your request including \u201cstatistical summaries\u201d, \"compilations\u201d, \u201ccrime data\u201d, \u201cCOMPSTAT\u201d, \u201ccrime dashboards\u201d, \u201ccharts\u201d, and \u201cspreadsheets\u201d. In an effort to locate records responsive to your request, the Department the following search: Between 2023-01-01 and 2025-06-18 Terms:(\"Statistical summaries\" OR \"compilations\" OR \"crime data\" OR \"incident reports\" OR \"COMPSTAT\" OR \"crime dashboards\" OR \"charts\" OR \"spreadsheets\" OR \"crime statistics\") Accounts:(joseph.narduzzo@pd.boston.gov, robert.ciccolo@pd.boston.gov, shawn.burns@pd.boston.gov, phillip.owens@pd.boston.gov, michael.cox@pd.boston.gov \nThis search generated 6,015 documents with a total of 54, 101 pages.\u00a0 The Department would need to review all of these records to determine responsiveness.\u00a0 The Department is also required to redact information that is not subject to disclosure including juvenile information, arrests involving minors, Criminal Offender Record Information, or incidents related to sexual assault. \u00a0 This would require administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently related\u00a0 to the category of materials requested; therefore, this request does not satisfy the statutory standard of reasonable description of records. See Chawla , Suffolk Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2. In Freidman , the Court focused on the reasonableness standard contemplated throughout the Public Records Law.\u00a0 The Court recognized that the reasonable description requirement is necessary under the Public Records Law because the intent of the law \u201cwas not intended to reduce government agencies to full-time investigators on behalf of requestors.\u201d Friedman quoting Assassination Archives & Research Ctr., Inc. v. Central Intelligence Agency, 720 F. Supp. 217, 219 (D.D.C. 1989) .\u00a0 The Department would need to review all\u00a0 54, 101 pages to determine responsiveness and to make any required redactions.\u00a0 This is too burdensome for the Department to meet the \"reasonably describes\u201d requirement.\u00a0 In addition to reviewing the reports to determine responsiveness, the Department would need to review all the records to see if there is anything that needs to be redacted under statutes such as juvenile information, arrests involving minors, Criminal Offender Record Information, or incidents related to sexual assault.\u00a0 The Department will also need to review the records to see if there is any personal identifying information related to specific individuals or anything identifying potential witnesses which may need to be removed under Exemptions C and F under the Public Records Law. This request does not comply with the Public Records Law because the request is seeking records that are articulated with broad language and it does not describe the record with sufficient particularity.\u00a0 It is the responsibility of the Department to prevent crimes, to examine crime data, and investigate crimes and to allocate its resources in the interest of public safety.\u00a0 The Department\u2019s business is public safety and is committed to community policing to foster relationships, to build trust, and to improve the quality of life through the City of Boston.\u00a0 The duty and efforts of the Department to keep the public safe would require looking into crime data, statistics, and incident reports which are part of your request.\u00a0 Because of the Department\u2019s duties and its role in public safety, a majority of its records contain the search terms that you identify or relate to the topics or categories in your request.\u00a0 Therefore, it is unclear what specific records you are requesting and this request does not comply with the reasonable statutory standard and is burdensome on the Department.\u00a0 This request will be closed. We encourage you to consider narrowing your request.\u00a0 You may wish to modify or clarify your request to provide sufficient particularity, including narrowing the time period or identifying specific incidents or records to enable the search to be processed. You may also review incident and obtain other public safety datasets by visiting https://data.boston.gov/group/public-safety In the event the City were able to determine the intended scope of your request, it is likely the City would have to provide a fee estimate given the likely volume of the potentially responsive records and the need for redaction or segregation of those records. Should you seek specific records I encourage you to visit the City's public records portal. https://bostonma.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(4ihmrhaxyjn0l4fkagn2d4jn))/supporthome.aspx Accordingly, this matter is now closed. \nYou may appeal the substantive nature of this response within ninety (90) days. See 950 C.M. R. 32.08(1). Sincerely, Christine O\u2019Donnell Assistant Corporation Counsel Office of the Legal Advisor Boston Police Department \n\nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Public Records Center.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Meech and Supervisor Arthur,\r\n\r\nI write to follow up on the open appeal SPR25/2015, regarding my June 17, 2025, public records request to the Boston Police Department (BPD), tracking number B001676-061725.\r\n\r\nThis request sought emails containing crime statistics from five named BPD command staff, covering the period from January 1, 2023 to present. The request was narrowly tailored in scope and topic.\r\n\r\nBPD\u2019s initial response on June 18 was a clearly mistaken denial referencing an unrelated  request to my request.  It referenced a different matter and failed to address any element of the actual records sought. This constituted a procedurally invalid response, resulting in a constructive denial.\r\n\r\nFollowing my appeal, BPD submitted a new denial on July 16, citing Chawla and Friedman  to claim overbreadth and burden. However, this response was both legally untimely and substantively unsupported:\r\n\r\n-BPD has acknowledged that a search returned 6,015 responsive records, confirming the request was specific and searchable.\r\n-The revised denial came after the statutory 10-business-day response window and therefore cannot revive BPD\u2019s ability to invoke new exemptions.\r\n-The Department made no effort to assist with narrowing the request or to propose rolling production.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Supervisor has already rejected similar defenses in my prior appeals:\r\n\r\nSPR25/1345 \u2014 Chawla and Friedman claims overruled; request deemed \u201creasonably described\u201d\r\nSPR25/1231 \u2014 Supervisor found that email requests with specific topics and custodians are proper and enforceable\r\n\r\nIn its July 16 denial, BPD cited Exemptions (c) and (f). These do not apply here:\r\nExemption (c) protects records of a personal nature, not internal communications among high-ranking officials about statistical crime stats.\r\nExemption (f) protects investigatory materials tied to particular law enforcement cases. The requested records \u2014 crime statistics and related summaries \u2014 are not tied to any ongoing criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nNotably, the Department itself has previously written:\r\n\u201cBecause of the Department\u2019s duties and its role in public safety, a majority of its records contain the search terms that you identify or relate to the topics or categories in your request.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is a clear admission that the records in question go to the heart of the Department\u2019s public mission \u2014 not confidential investigations. These are the very kinds of records the public has a right to review to evaluate police performance, accountability, and public safety outcomes.\r\n\r\nAs the Supreme Judicial Court made clear in Flatley, it is the agency\u2019s burden to prove why each exemption applies \u2014 and general references are not enough. If the Legislature intended to exempt all police records from public disclosure, it would have said so explicitly. It did not.\r\n\r\nThe Supervisor has repeatedly upheld the public\u2019s right to access crime data and statistical communications. BPD\u2019s attempt to shield such records contradicts both the law and its own stated role in public safety. \r\n\r\nThis is not an isolated incident. The Boston Police Department has previously entered into settlement agreements concerning public records compliance, including the attached agreement. Yet the Department continues to use legally baseless denials, untimely responses, and improper exemptions to delay access to core public records.\r\n\r\nThis sustained pattern of behavior raises serious concerns about whether the Department is acting in good faith, as required by G.L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a) and 950 CMR 32.08(2). At minimum, it justifies heightened scrutiny and a clear ruling ordering immediate disclosure without further delay.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request a ruling ordering the immediate production of responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if any clarification is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Franklin Rd Ewing, IL and\r\n14425 Rescue Church Rd, Whittingon, IL.\r\n\r\nThere are no documents submitted reporting residency fraud with the above\r\nnames or addresses listed in our files.\r\n\r\nDocuments pertaining to the request for redistricting of 16178 E. Franklin\r\nRd Ewing, IL.\r\n\r\nI have attached the petition, secretary's report, proof of publication,\r\nOrder of denial of petition request, verbatim records from the court\r\nreporter, a letter of rehearing request from the petitioner, and a letter\r\nof denial of rehearing from the Regional Board of School Trustees.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of policy for investigating reports of residency fraud.\r\n\r\nThere is no policy for investigating residency fraud.  Districts have\r\nresidency policies by statute.  In instances where residency is being\r\nskirted, districts can hold residency hearings to remove those in\r\nviolation.  The Regional Superintendent of Schools is tasked with any\r\nappeals that result from such hearings.  I have none on record.  In\r\ninstances where violations are made known to me, a phone contact is made\r\nwith the school districts for them to pursue.\r\n\r\nDocument showing number of fraud claims made annually and if possible\r\nbroken down by adjudication status.\r\n\r\nA search of my correspondence shows 1 file on hand for a residency\r\ncomplaint (letter was anonymous).   I am including that letter,  with names\r\nredacted due to the very small nature of the district involved which would\r\nrisk the possibility of identifying the children involved.\n*Matt Renaud*\r\n*Regional Superintendent of Schools*\r\n*Regional Office of Education #13*\r\n*Clinton-Jefferson-Marion-Washington Counties*",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Redex Corp. The FBI has located approximately 2948 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll communications that include the term \"Gulf of America\" or \"renaming the Gulf of Mexico\".\r\n\r\nThis should include\u2013but not be limited to\u2014emails, notes, memoranda and presentations between USGS staff and between USGS staff and external third parties.\r\n\r\nPlease include all documentation within the period January 1, 2024 to January 22, 2025, inclusive.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Mr. Dave Levinthal, assigned control number DOI-2025-003169, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the Office of the Director, Office of Communications and Publishing, U.S. Board on Geographic Names, Office of the Alaska Regional Director, and Office of the Southeast Regional Director.\r\n\r\n1.

The same types of records on purchase of Greenland\r\n\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2025, to the present.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Bloomberg News, assigned control number DOI-2025-003184, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the US Geological Survey's U.S. Board on Geographic Names\r\n\r\n1) All records, which includes, but is not limited to emails (including attachments), text messages, internal studies, final reports, directives, memos, letters, on changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\"\r\n\r\n2)The same types of records on changing the name of Denali to \"Mount McKinley.\"\r\n\r\n3) Emails (including attachments) of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention \"Gulf of America\"\r\n\r\n4) Emails of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention Denali or Mount McKinley.\r\n\r\nThe timeframe for this request is January 1, 2025 to the present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from WIRED, assigned control number DOI-2025-003203, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRecords dated from December 1, 2024 through the time this request is processed relating to Donald Trump's desire to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and the related executive order and in the possession of Michael Tischler, Shellie Zahniser, or Chris Hammond of the U.S. Geological Survey.  The term \u201crecords\u201d includes emails (with attachments) but also refers to other documents and items, such as text messages; invitations, communications, and chats from meeting applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams; encrypted apps such as Signal, WhatsApp, and others; phone records; calendar entries; recordings of virtual or in-person meetings; and communications on collaboration platforms such as Slack. It omits news articles and messages from listservs that distribute them unless accompanied by substantial commentary from one of the above-named people or an interlocutor.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.  We have gathered materials as potentially responsive to DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.  However, we have not yet completed a review of these records.  We will provide records in rolling releases to you in conjunction with releases issue for DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.\r\n\r\nWe classified you as an \u201cother use\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to 2 hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).  We do not anticipate any fees related to your request.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.

Your request falls into the Complex processing track, there are 11 requests pending ahead of yours in our processing queue.\r\n\r\nAt this time, we are actively working on your request.  We have completed the preliminary review of the potentially responsive records.  We are preparing an interim release to you and have sent the records for an internal review.  We anticipate providing the interim release to you by March 17, 2025.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the remaining records, consultations have been sent to other federal agencies, and we are waiting for their responses.  Once we receive responses from the other federal agencies, the records will still need to go through legal review by the Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, Division of General Law.\r\n\r\nWe apologize for this delay.  You may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently assigned track or move the request into a different track (which may have the effect of reducing the cost of processing your request and having it processed more quickly).

Please be advised that a contractor, Unity Health Care, Inc., provides health care services to DOC inmates. The information you are requesting relates to the contractor\u2019s personnel matter. It is not the kind of information that DOC creates and maintains. Under the FOIA, an agency\u2019s search obligation is limited to records or information the agency has created and/or maintained. Finally, DOC did not create and did not find the requested list.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your FOIA request, please be advised that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you may appeal to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d or \u201cFOIA Appeal\u201d in the subject line of the letter as well as on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request, (2) a copy of this letter, (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and or arguments advanced in support of disclosure, and (4) a daytime telephone number, and e-mail and/or U.S. Mail address at which you can be reached.

Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to me.\r\n\r\nFailure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOluwasegun Obebe\nRecords, Information & Privacy Officer\r\nDC Department of Corrections\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\n3924 Minnesota Ave, NE\r\nWashington, DC 20019\r\n(202) 671-2055 (O)\r\n(202) 538-2389 (C)\r\n(202) 671-1705 (F)\r\nSegun.obebe@dc.gov<mailto:Segun.obebe@dc.gov>\r\nwww.doc.dc.gov<http://www.doc.dc.gov/>\r\n[cid:image003.jpg@01DBDADE.CB5B3A30]",

If you do not have this directly on file, any guidance or direction would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nTo provide some context: I represent a grassroots meditation group that offers free, trauma-informed mindfulness programs to support the well-being of incarcerated individuals. We\u2019re hoping to connect with relevant stakeholders \u2014 including chaplains and behavioral health coordinators \u2014 to understand whether our offerings might be supportive within existing wellness or rehabilitative programming.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nRequest number: 20250612-RT1\r\n\r\nWe received your request for FLOCK records. We have located responsive records for items 1, 3a and 3b. The scope of records for item 2 would be very large and creating a record that we do not have. Pursuant to per WAC 44-14-04003(6)<https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=44-14-04003>, we are not obligated to create a record in order to fulfill this request:\r\n\r\n(6) No duty to create records. An agency is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request. However, sometimes it is easier for an agency to create a record responsive to the request rather than collecting and making available voluminous records that contain small pieces of the information sought by the requestor or find itself in a controversy about whether the request requires the creation of a new record. The decision to create a new record is left to the discretion of the agency. With respect to databases, for example, there is not always a simple dichotomy between producing an existing record and creating a new record. In addition, an agency may decide to provide a customized service and if so, assess a customized service charge for the actual costs of staff technology expertise needed to prepare data compilations, or when such customized access services are not used by the agency for other business purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wish to receive the records responsive to items 1, 3a and 3b there is a fee of $3.50. I have attached the worksheet for how the fee was calculated based off the fact that necessary redactions will be applied to some documents. Please call the main line below during normal business hours Mon-Fri 8:30-4:30) to pay your fee. We will be closed tomorrow, 6/19.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive payment by 6/27/25 your request will be considered abandoned and closed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DBE033.AC1569C0]\r\nMiranda Jeter\r\nRecords Clerk\r\nBonney Lake Police Department\r\nOffice Phone (253) 863 - 2218 opt. 4\r\nFax  (253) 863 - 2661\r\n18421 Veterans Memorial Drive E.

Your request was sent to JMD by the US Marshals Service as a misdirected request. The identifying tracking number was 2025-USMS-001026.  For your information, the Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).  Please refer to your assigned JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER listed above whenever you contact the Department regarding this request.  Sincerely,  Daniel Wagner FOIA Contact Justice Management Division",

This form includes 30 questions across several categories and appears to be the basis for the 3.81 aggregate score posted on the district\u2019s website in the June meeting minutes. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, can you please confirm whether Form 2 was completed by members of the Board of Education as part of the 2024\u20132025 evaluation process? If so, I respectfully request copies\u2014draft or final\u2014of any completed versions of this form in their entirety. The rubric responses and section-level evaluations offer important context for understanding the final composite score. If individual board member evaluations were not retained, can you confirm if a final version with the averages by question is available? \r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSam Bellford\r\n",

Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States. During the current administration of District Attorney Barbara Romo, we have had one Giglio disclosure letter and case re: former Officer Robert Turney in our Cibola County District. Included here is a document fragment detailing the underlying case. The allegation of misconduct came from a discovery from the district court; therefore, we don\u2019t have specific additional records other than the attached letters to:\r\n\r\n  *   The letter the Sheriff of Cibola County asked our deputy to draft and send.\r\n  *   The spreadsheet detailing the cases for which we had to submit a disclosure letter.\r\n  *   A copy of the disclosure letter.( Each letter heading was corrected for each case otherwise the body of the letter was the same, the letter attached is a sample).\r\n  *   Letter to the Defense Counsel\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n//Melissa Howden//\r\n\r\n\r\nMelissa A.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

        "communication": "Dear Director at the Office of Information Policy, \r\n\r\nThis letter is in reference to FOIA Request #24-00644-F which you closed on March 25th 2024 after a lengthy response suggesting no responsive documents have met the plain letter language of my FOIA request. I believe this request was closed in error and am humbly appealing your judgement. \r\n\r\n1) In denying this request your office suggested that the request for correspondences was too broad. However, your response does not indicate that an actual search has occurred. In order to help your team limit your search I am rewriting this search to better help guide your search. I am also available for a call if you would like to discuss further refining this search. \r\n\r\n- Emails, letters, and text messages between the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and India\u2019s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) mentioning \"Operation Broader Sword\" between January 1st 2022 and the date this request is full-filled.\r\n\r\nI believe this request both specifies types of correspondences, the senders and receivers, and the specific date ranges for which you to search. Operation Broader Sword is a highly publicized operation. (See: https://in.usembassy.gov/u-s-and-india-cooperate-on-operation-broader-sword-to-stop-international-shipments-of-illegal-and-dangerous-drugs-medical-devices/). The DEA's involvement alongside the other agencies has also been highly publicized. (SEE: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/us-india-joint-operation-seizes-500-shipments-of-illicit-prescription-drugs-and-medical-devices/article67053528.ece). \r\n\r\nEmails, Text Messages, and Letters sent by public servants in their capacity as public servants are public records. Thus they are FOIA'ble. Retrieving already existing emails, text messages, or letters, is not requesting a new record be created. It is not tantamount to research. \r\n\r\n2) The seizure of 500 shipments of contraband has been highly publicized. (SEE: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/us-india-joint-operation-seizes-500-shipments-of-illicit-prescription-drugs-and-medical-devices/article67053528.ece). DEA rules mandate such records be kept for at least two years (SEE: https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/mtgs/researcher_train/conf_2019/feb_2019/barron.pdf). \r\n\r\nFor this reason, I believe there are in fact responsive documents to the following request:\r\n\r\nAny documents including but not limited to seizure records, arrest records, contracts, reports, intelligence briefings regarding \"Operation Broader Sword\" between January 1st 2022 and the date this request is full-filled.\r\n\r\nA reminder that I am a journalist and this information is being requested in the public interest to shed light on the cross-border illicit drug trade impacting US citizens. It is in the public's interest to know about the inflows of such material into the country and therefore I am requesting a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nLastly, the FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or to conduct research, analyze data, or answer questions when responding to requests. The retrieval of already existing documents is not research. It is the FOIA officers job to find responsive public documents to a request or provide specific statute exemptions for why a FOIA request hasn't been completed. This has not happened in this case. \r\n\r\nConsidering the myriad of media reports about this operation, I believe responsive documents do in fact exist. Please provide a timeline in which you can conduct a reasonable search for these documents. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time. I am available on the following phone number if you'd like to chat more +1 347 770 4163 / +1 347 775 7522.",

During an initial review of the referred materials, they determined that some of the records contained equities that belong to agencies other than the FDA.  So the OC FOIA staff are working on determining which agencies those records will need to be re-referred to.\r\n\r\nAs far as the materials that contained FDA equities, OC FOIA staff are currently working to consult with internal subject matter experts on release determinations.  At this time they are anticipating being able to issue a response for the FDA equities within the next two to four weeks.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\u200b________________________\r\nMs. Charis Wilson, PhD, CRM\r\nDenials & Appeals Officer\r\n\r\nOffice of Management and Enterprise Services\r\nOffice of the Commissioner\r\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\r\n240-402-9116\n",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.

It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",
