Bodycam footage reportedly captures officers encouraging Nino\u2019s father to physically discipline him, dismissing allegations of abuse, and making statements such as \"Your dad should beat you\" and \"You have no rights.\" A confrontation ensued when Officer Willer attempted to take Nino\u2019s phone, resulting in officers using force against him. Nino suffered a broken wrist, facial lacerations requiring stitches, and was subsequently hospitalized. He was charged with aggravated assault, though charges were later dropped.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nSpoke with Sergio Nino\u2019s father before engaging with the teenager.\r\nInteracted with Sergio Nino, including advising his father on discipline.\r\nUsed force on Nino, leading to his injuries and subsequent arrest.\r\nTransported Nino from the scene to medical facilities or booking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",
