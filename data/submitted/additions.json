        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDepartment of Energy publications show the DOE awarded the Nuclear Alternative Project (NAP) a $1,628,285 grant  in 2021 to evaluate the \"general site suitability for small modular reactors and microreactors in Puerto Rico. Results of the study will support DOEs mission to commercialize these technologies in small island and/or remote locations.\" This is the second grant NAP has been awarded by the DOE to study the viability of nuclear energy in Puerto Rico. (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-awards-85-million-advance-promising-nuclear-technologies)\r\n\r\nThe first grant given to NAP by DOE was for $800,000 to make a similar nuclear suitability study in Puerto Rico. (https://www.paralanaturaleza.org/avanza-el-plan-para-instalar-energia-nuclear-en-puerto-rico/)\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) Communications, emails, messages, and attachments between the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy's U.S. Industry Opportunities and members of the NAP concerning the two grants given to NAP by the DOE. \r\n\r\n2) Documents, presentations, videos, or any such documentation of the approval process for giving the two grants to NAP. Specifically, documents that show the approval criteria for awarding the grant and how it was met by NAP's proposal.\r\n\r\n3) Documents showing the budget and/or cost breakdown of how the grants by DOE were used to carry out the necessary activities to complete both nuclear viability studies in Puerto Rico. \r\n\r\nThis records request is for records between January 1, 2019 and the time this request is processed.\r\n\r\nKeywords: \"Nuclear Alternative Project,\" \"NAP,\" \"Puerto Rico,\" and \"nuclear\"\r\n\r\nThis record is not being made for commercial purposes. I am an independent journalist from Puerto Rico and any documents released from this request will be used in the course of reporting about energy policies and innovations in Puerto Rico for the newsletter Heavy Weather (heavyweather.ghost.io).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",
