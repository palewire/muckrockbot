I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n2. I have submitted more than 200 FOA requests to DHS agency FOIA offices since May 2019. \r\n3. The vast majority of these requests remain in extended backlogs, often with processing times that far exceed the median and average times reported by the agency. \r\n4. DHS Agency FOIA offices have repeatedly excepted my requests from a first-in, first-out processing by providing responses to FOIA requests that contain the same information I sought, despite their filing the request after I did. \r\n5. DHS has not promulgated any regulation or published any subregulatory rule, policy, procedure, guidance, manual, or other instruction to staff regarding the targeting or use of a vexsome filer or similar designation. \r\n6. Consequently, any application of such internal designation to requests I have submitted would appear violate 5 USC 552(a)(2)(E)(i) & (ii). \r\n7. DHS FOIA offices have repeatedly been held to engage in a pattern and practice of FOIA violations by federal courts. See, e.g., Owen v. ICE (CD Cal), Nightengale v. USCIS (ND Cal). \r\n8. There is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged government misconduct - namely, the use/misuse of a vexsome FOIA filer list to deny, slow, or meter requestors' FOIA productions based on the frequency with which we exercise our statutory rights to demand information from our (nominally) democratically accountable institutions. \r\n9. Placing this request in the regular track for processing will doom it to multi-month, if not multi-year purgatory at your agency's current processing rate, effectively covering up the potentially unlawful practice of discriminatory treatment based on the frequency with which a particular requestor exercises their statutory right to seek information about what our government is up to. \r\n\r\nThank you for your timely consideration of this expedited processing request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll investigative records that reference the company FlagWix (flagwix.com). FlagWix began selling overtly political flags during the 2020 political election. FlagWix made a massive advertising buy on Facebook and Instagram running targeted ads to residents of the state of Georgia offering Confederate flags. These ads, which Meta's corporate legal team was alerted to of at the time, likely ran afoul of Meta's advertising rules at the time. \r\n\r\nAccording to a book scheduled to be published in coming months, Flagwix \"invented\" and popularized an American flag design featuring Jesus Christ. The company also reportedly created (and then marketed) an all black flag American flag that gained popularity among far-right activists in the United States in 2021. \r\n\r\nReporting suggests that FlagWix is based in China, and the ownership of the company is likely connected to the Chinese Communist Party. The personal information of FlagWix customers provides a Chinese Communist Party-linked entity with a trove of information regarding the political beliefs of numerous American citizens. \r\n\r\nIf Flagwix (or it's subsidiary dixiebone.com) are currently under Bureau investigation, please do not deny the entire request and release any information available under the law. If you cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the Bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
