        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) The decisions issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals between October 1, 2016, and the date of processing of this request, arising from cases decided by former-IJ George W. Riggs, that were administratively closed, reversed, background check remand, and/or remand.\r\n\r\n2)  I would request any printouts, summaries, spreadsheets, reports, or other records or datasets that may encompass or address how many of removal orders included a negative credibility determination for any Respondent(s) for whom former-IJ George W. Riggs issued removal orders in protection/form I-589 cases (in other words, decisions on Asylum, Wittholding of Removal, or Relief under the Convention Against Torture), after merits/individual hearings occurred, between October 1, 2016 and the end of his tenure at EOIR.\r\n\r\n3) All correspondence or communications in any medium (including but not limited to any email, fax, letter, text/SMS/MMS, memorandum, voicemail, audio recording, sticky-note, or any attachment thereto, and any conversion of any of the foregoing from a digital to analog form/format, or vice-versa) to or from former-IJ George W. Riggs, from October 1, 2016 through the end of his tenure at EOIR, containing the words \"credibility,\" \"credible,\" \"incredible,\" \"incoherent,\" \"demeanor,\" \"candor,\" \"evasive,\" \"non-responsive,\" \"responsiveness,\" \"inconsistent,\" \"consistent,\" \"consistency,\" \"facial expression(s),\" \"body language,\" \"standard language,\" or \"addendum of law,\" or any abbreviation, contraction, misspelling, pluralization, or paraphrase thereof.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of each and every \"standard language addendum of law\" or any substantially similar 'boilerplate' or 'template' document utilized by former-IJ George W. Riggs as an exhibit in, as an attachment to, or as a drafting aid for any merits decision in a protection/form I-589 matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested records will be made available to the general public via a FOIA records clearinghouse, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes; rather, the results will be disseminated to interested individuals free of charge, and with no pecuniary gain to the Requestor, who is not (I hope and assume) the subject of any of these records.  Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business.  You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts.  Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA.  It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. \r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDerrick Hensley",

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request a ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request a ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit a ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting a ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

Every pilot must make this final check to ensure the general integrity of their aircraft. Here\u2019s a brief overview:\r\n\r\n\r\nCabin Inspection\r\nThe first step, check that you have the require paperwork. The acronym ARROW can help you remember the five documents you need to bring:\r\n\r\nAirworthiness Certificate\r\nRegistration Certificate\r\nRadio Station License (only required for operations outside the U.S.)\r\nOperating Handbook\r\nWeight and Balance Data\r\nLegally, these documents and certificates must be inside the aircraft, and the airworthiness certificate needs to be on display where passengers can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second step:\r\n\r\nMake sure the cockpit switches and valve toggles are in the right position.\r\nSwitch the battery on and record fuel gauge readings  to compare to your visual inspection later.\r\nTurn off the battery and make sure the magnetos are off.\r\nClean the cockpit of all trash and any unsecured tools and make sure your seatbelts aren\u2019t fraying or loose.\r\nIf your plane has fuses, find the location and number of spares.\r\nExterior Inspection\r\nAll pilots should do a walk-around of their aircraft before a flight even if it was recently serviced and approved, it is always a good idea to double check all components. Pre-flight inspections ensure nothing is damaged or overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Third step :\r\n\r\nLook for loose rivets, bolts, nuts and safety-wired devices and any residue around these items.\r\nCheck brake pads and discs for thickness and look for rust and grooves.\r\nCheck tires for wear and flats by rolling the plane forward and backward.\r\nCheck oleo struts for proper inflation.\r\nTest rigged controls for free movement with no chafing  don\u2019t forget to remove the control lock.\r\nMake sure control hinge fasteners are secure.\r\nCheck the propeller for oil leaks, significant damage and loose blades.\r\nInspect the engine check oil levels and make sure air intakes are free of debris.\r\nCheck the exhaust pipe  make sure it\u2019s free of oil and black buildup.\r\nFuel system Check the fuel quantity and compare to cockpit gauges, look for correct octane color and debris and make sure fuel vents aren\u2019t obstructed.\r\nDrain sumps and sample fuel  be sure fuel doesn\u2019t keep dripping after.\r\nClean your windows, inside and out.\r\nReview your aircraft\u2019s performance data and emergency procedures.\r\nOnce you complete a thorough preflight inspection, you can take to the air with confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: PreFlight pilot checklist\r\n\r\n1. I am making a request for pre- flight pilot checklist for international flight plan (FAA7233-4) from January 1, 2013 to November 31, 2013 for Singapore airline which is referred to \"Singapore airlines Limited\" and registration number: 9V-SKJ. Please provide me the pre- flight pilot checklist for Singapore Airline that came to John F. Kennedy international airport on January 1 2013 to November 31, 2013 .\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n Subject: seat Configuration.\r\n\r\n1. Please be advised to provide me the major repair and alteration of airframe power plant propeller or Appliance. (FAA- form 337)from January 1, 2013 to November 31, 2013 for Singapore airline  which is referred to (\"Singapore airline Limited\") and the registration number: 9V-SKJ. \r\n\r\n2. FAA FORM 337 FAA Form 337, Major Repair and Alteration (Airframe, Powerplant, Propeller, or Appliance), serves two purpose. It provides: 1. Owners and operators with a record of major repairs and major alterations, indicating details and approval. 2. The FAA with a copy for the aircraft records. An example of a typical completed FAA Form 337 is provided in appendix 1, figure 2. \r\n \r\n3.Airworthiness and registration certificates for Singapore Airlines which is refer to Singapore Airline Limited and the registration number:9V-SKJ. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the FAA rules:\r\n\r\n129.13 Airworthiness and registration certificates.\r\n(a) No foreign air carrier may operate any aircraft within the United States unless that aircraft carries a current registration certificate and displays the nationality and registration markings of the State of Registry, and an airworthiness certificate issued or validated by:\r\n\r\n(1) The State of Registry; or\r\n\r\n(2) The State of the Operator, provided that the State of the Operator and the State of Registry have entered into an agreement under Article 83bis of the Convention on International Civil Aviation that covers the aircraft.\r\n\r\n(b) No foreign air carrier may operate a foreign aircraft within the United States except in accordance with the limitations on maximum certificated weights prescribed for that aircraft and that operation by the country of manufacture of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIRCRAFT CERTIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe FAA issues different certifications for aircraft depending on their purpose. The maintenance requirements for these different types of uses vary, so it\u2019s crucial to know which one you\u2019re applying for and how to keep up with the right maintenance:\r\n\r\nStandard Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA approves applications for a standard airworthiness certificate if your registered aircraft complies with one of the following aircraft categories: normal, commuter, utility, transport or acrobatic. You must also maintain a condition that\u2019s safe for operation, as well as conduct preventative maintenance \u2014 any modifications you make to your aircraft must meet the requirements of 14 CFR Parts 21, 43 and 91.\r\n\r\nSpecial Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA issues special airworthiness certificates for primary, restricted, multiple, limited, experimental, provisional and special flight aircraft. To qualify for this certificate, your aircraft must meet several standards detailed in 14 CFR Part 21, 45, 48, 91 and 375, as well as policies that specify additional aircraft maintenance requirements.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCharlemagne Limage",

Mr. Swartz passed away in 2013 and was\r\n    known for his work on various online projects and his advocacy for open\r\n    access to information.\r\n    \r\n    To aid in your search, I would like to request that an interagency search be\r\n    conducted for any records related to Aaron Swartz that may be held by other\r\n    government agencies. This would include but not be limited to the National\r\n    Security Agency (NSA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Department of\r\n    Justice (DOJ).\r\n    \r\n    Please be advised that I do not consent to the withholding, redaction, or\r\n    deletion of any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld,\r\n    redacted, or deleted, I will have no choice but to file an appeal or bring\r\n    an action in federal court to compel their disclosure.\r\n    \r\n    In support of my request, I cite the following relevant court cases:\r\n    \r\n    McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\r\n    Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971)\r\n    Church of Scientology of California v.

If any responsive records are withheld, please provide\r\n    a detailed explanation of the exemption(s) that justify withholding the\r\n    records.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

For example, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (2019), the court ruled that the government could not withhold or redact records related to the CIA's use of drone strikes. Additionally, in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy (2020), the court ruled that the government must release certain records related to climate change policy.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to the following records:\r\n\r\nArchitectural drawings and blueprints of The Cadet Chapel, including any revisions or updates made over the past 10 years.\r\nRecords related to the construction and maintenance of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any contracts or agreements with contractors and vendors.\r\nRecords related to the funding of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any budget reports or financial statements.\r\nAny records related to events or ceremonies held at The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including guest lists, program materials, and photographs.\r\nTo facilitate your search for the requested documents, please let me know if there are any specific offices or departments that may hold the requested documents.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you do not redact, withhold, or delete any responsive records. If any documents are withheld or redacted, I will seek a court order to compel their release. Please note that the government's obligation to disclose records under FOIA is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, and I urge you to fully comply with my request.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make a special request for any records related to the history and significance of The Cadet Chapel at West Point. As a landmark building with a rich history, I am interested in learning more about the cultural and historical significance of The Cadet Chapel, and any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRelated to your driver's licensing and registration processes. Because when it comes to driving, it's not just about getting from point A to point B, it's about feeling the family connection (if you know what I mean).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting all documents, emails, and memos related to the processing time of driver's license applications and registration documents for the past five years. Because when you're part of the family, you want to make sure that everyone is taken care of (even if it means waiting in line for what feels like forever).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request any statistics or reports on the number of people who have fallen asleep while waiting in line at any of the NY DMV offices during the past five years. Because we all know that sometimes, waiting in line can feel like spending quality time with your second cousin twice removed (you know, the one who always falls asleep at family gatherings).\r\n\r\nIf possible, please include any information on the measures taken by the DMV to address long wait times and to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals waiting in line. Because we're all part of the same family here, and we want to make sure that everyone is treated with respect and care.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the importance of efficiency and accuracy in processing these requests, I couldn't help but wonder if any of your employees have ever felt the need for speed, so to speak. Any reports or records related to any high-speed pursuits, street racing incidents, or other dangerous activities involving DMV employees would be greatly appreciated (but we won't tell anyone, because family always sticks together).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
