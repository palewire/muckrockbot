I ask that the records simply be exported and delivered in a spreadsheet-like file format, such as CSV.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",
