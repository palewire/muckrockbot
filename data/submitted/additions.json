This includes: \r\nA) any notes taken during meetings that discussed the use of \"EagleAI\" OR \"Eagle AI\" OR \"Eagle A.I.\" \r\nB) any explanations (whether internally or externally generated) of how \"EagleAI\" OR \"Eagle AI\" OR \"Eagle A.I.\" works.\r\nC) any other document that has been used to help explain the use of \"EagleAI\" OR \"Eagle AI\" OR \"Eagle A.I.\" to any party, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n3) Any emails as well as documents, (including but not limited to PDF, word processing, excel, and slide documents) that mention \"EagleAI\" OR \"Eagle AI\" OR \"Eagle A.I.\" This includes any correspondence with EagleAI employees, and calendar invitations for meetings with these employees.\r\n\r\nPlease limit the time frame of all searches to 9/9/2020 to the time that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nThis FOI request is being filed in pursuit of a time-sensitive news story. Therefore, I ask that my request is expedited. When completing this request, please prioritize whichever records would take the least amount of time to be located and released. I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method, and again, please release documents on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions about my request, can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me at emailcarolinehaskins@gmail.com. I am also happy to hop on the phone.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a reporter for Business Insider, and the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and I look forward to your reply within 10 business days, and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline Haskins",
