If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing the neo-nazi website titled White Honor,\r\n    hosted at WhiteHonor.com, including but not limited to references located in\r\n    cross references such as 266N-NK-116993 or records relating either of the\r\n    cyber incidents described in the attachments.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

All badge numbers linked to the corresponding race, gender, and age if available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

For similar responsive records on Use of Force data from January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021, please visit request number #21-9649.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per your communication on February 13, 2022, below is our previous communication from February 1, 2022:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Use of force (UOF) data dating from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. This data should include the case number, incident date, incident time, suspect injured indicator, suspect injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), suspect age, suspect gender, suspect ethnicity, suspect weapon type, incident area occurred, whether the officer was injured, force type, and most importantly, badge number associated with the officers involved.\r\n\r\n2. All police shifts for each employee (identified by badge number) from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. This should include the time of start and end for each shift, the date of the shift, and the corresponding badge number of the employee.\r\n\r\n3. Employee demographics for all employees employed from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. All badge numbers linked to the corresponding race, gender, and age if available.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #1 of your request, the records you are seeking have been previously provided in another request (see:\u00a0https://lacity.nextrequest.com/requests/21-9649) for Use of Force data for time period January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the following fields are what has been provided: incident date, incident time, area occurred, case number, suspect ethnicity, suspect age, suspect gender, suspect injuries force related (yes or no), suspect injury type description, suspect weapon type description, employee ethnicity, employee injuries force related (yes or no), employee injury description, incident area occurred, employee unit description, force type description, and finding type.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department did not provide Officer badge numbers as they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Sections 6254(c) and (k) of the Act. Section 6254(c) exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0Section 6254(k), exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Penal Code.\u00a0Penal Code Section 832.7 states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code.\u00a0[See Penal Code Sections 832.5 and 832.7 and Evidence Code Sections 1043 and 1045]. California case law holds that Evidence Code Section 1043\u00a0et seq.\u00a0is the exclusive means to obtain peace officer personnel records, and as such, they are exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Act.\u00a0[See\u00a0City of Hemet v. Superior Court\u00a0(1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th\u00a01411].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, for the sake of transparency the employee\u2019s ethnicity and unit description have been provided.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to Use of Force data for the time period of October 28, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and #3 of your request, please be advised that, pursuant to California Government Code Section 6253(c), we are still searching for, collecting, and/or reviewing the requested records. Should any records be located we will require time to review the requested records for confidential portions that are exempt from disclosure under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255. We will provide you with a response upon completion of our review. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #2 of your request, please note that in order for the Department to provide the requested data, the Department would have to take affirmative steps to locate all potentially responsive documents, related to sworn personnel, and then manually review and extract the specific information that is being sought. Due to the amount of time it would take to do so and based on the same need to retain confidentiality of certain information, the request is unduly burdensome as interpreted by the courts under the \"public interest\" provision of Government Code Section 6255 of the California Public Records Act. Similarly, the Department asserts the exemption due to our belief that disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to endanger the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public. Therefore, we are denying this portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \r\n\"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" \r\nPlease also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. \r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

It is our interpretation that matters prior to the date of repeal remain protected as dispositions in such matters may have been entered into on the basis of reliance and understanding that Sec. 50-a of the NYS Civil Rights Act would prevent public disclosure of such information.  Additionally, disclosure of disciplinary matters wherein the subject was exonerated or the allegations/claims were determined unfounded would be protected pursuant to New York Public Officer\u2019s Law \u00a787(2)(b), under which access to records may be denied where disclosure \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of subdivision two of section eighty-nine of this article.\u201d   The Committee on Open Government has opined that \u201cwhen allegations or charges of misconduct have not yet been determined or did not result in disciplinary action, the records relating to such allegations may\u2026be withheld, for disclosure would result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d See, FOIL AO 19775, quoting FOIL AO 17195.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nErik C.

This would include emails, complaints, and any other records regarding or related to AdventHealth/Adventist Health System in our agency\u2019s custody. Thus far, we have already located over 53,000 email records and over 290 complaints records that are responsive to the request.  If there is a specific issue or matter regarding AdventHealth/Adventist Health that the requestor is looking for, that could help us narrow our search and limit the cost and the amount of records that would need to be reviewed for confidential and exempt information.\r\n\r\nIf the requestor wishes to narrow the request or has something more specific they are looking for, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nKylie",

First of all, Florida's Office of the Attorney General has been a great help and I sincerely appreciate all of you.\r\n\r\n I am interested in all 290 complaints within the criteria I specified.\r\n\r\nAs far as emails, I separately, I revise the criteria to be from August 29th, 2022 to 2023, the date of the processing of this request. Please let me know if the emails still produce too numerous of results in that timeframe or is overly burdensome. If so, I narrow the criteria further in regards to emails to include only the following individuals that are presently part of AdventHealth (aka Adventist Health System) leadership as either sender, recipient, cc, bcc, or otherwise in the body of the email. These individuals in leadership are: Terry D Shaw (Terry.Shaw@AdventHealth.com) [CEO/President nationwide for AdventHealth], Randy Haffner (Randy.Haffner@AdventHealth.com) [CEO of AdventHealth's Florida Division], Opal Howard (Opal.Howard@AdventHealth.com)[Chief People Officer], Heather Ross (Heather.Ross@AdventHealth.com) [Director of Employee Relations], Jeffrey Bromme (Jeffery.Broome@AdventHealth.com) [Chief Legal Office], and the Paul Rathbun (Paul.Rathbun@AdventHealth.com) [Chief Financial Officer] as well if any email originated from their personal emails, if that is readily known, otherwise that may be disregarded. Additionally, I add an attorney that represents AdventHealth, whose name is Paul Prather (PPrather@littler.com) [Law Firm: Littler].\r\n\r\nThe full leadership page (which may be slightly outdated since some contacts do not apparently have an @AdventHealth.com email address) can be found here: https://www.adventhealth.com/adventhealth-leadership\r\n\r\nIf this still produces too numerous results, you may contact me for additional clarification, and I will further narrow the criteria.\r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",

These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased).

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your following up with us regarding this request.  The DHS regulation requires that requesters describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DHS personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-random search for the record based on the component\u2019s filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems. The regulation also states that to the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, component, or reference number.\r\n\r\nConversely, requests seeking \u201cany records\u201d without regard to a specific topic or keyword generate a great deal of material that is unlikely to be of interest to the public or shed light on the government\u2019s operations but will still need to go through the page-by-page, line-by-line review process.  Processing these kinds of requests do not provide as much value to the public, and hinder our ability to respond to all FOIA requesters in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThus, please provide us with an office or component, names of individuals/targets that you believe have these records, in addition to, keywords or phrases and a specific timeframe to narrow the scope of your search.  Let us know if you have any further questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nThe Privacy Office\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\r\n245 Murray Lane SW\r\nSTOP-0655\r\nWashington, D.C. 20528-0655\r\n'202-343-1743 | '866-431-0486 | 7 202-343-4011\r\n\u2022 foia@hq.dhs.gov<mailto:foia@hq.dhs.gov>\r\n\r\nThis is covered by federal and state law governing electronic communications and may contain confidential and legally privileged information.

We pulled all documents in our system, and 2008 was the oldest year for which we have data available on referenda. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIncluded in each file is the text of the referendum, the local government area, the county, and the election date. We do not have the result of the election in these files though you are welcome to use our Election Results Dashboard to view historical election results, including referenda. The threshold for these to pass is 50%.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nState Board Staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at North Carolina State Board of Elections.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 232 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 659 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 998 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 1360313-0 for FBI records concerning John Francis Good.  The FBI has located approximately 1,782 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

Sorry for my not being informed of the name change.\r\n\r\nWith regards to this FOIA on John Good, one main file and two reference serials were located on this subject.  The main file does consist of 5 sections with approximately 1,777 pages covering Mr. Good's career.  If you do want this request to be processed from the medium track queue with current estimated time for processing at about 7 months, the first two sections can be processed in whole and the 3rd section partial processing up to the 949 threshold for page count.  For this reduced scope, upon completion of all materials (an interim CD release should be received in about 3 to 4 months), you can place another FOIA request, citing this one, and ask for additional materials to be processed from this case.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this.  I do appreciate your consideration and patience.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeslie Wilson",

Ploeser, while part of the American Veterans Committee, Fight Inflation Committee (his organization), Congress of Industrial Organizations, and other groups in the city. He married Helen Eileen Mills in 1950 in St. Louis. He later worked as a major organizer of Mobilization of Youth, an antipoverty group in New York in the 1960s, headed the Jimmerson Houses Committee for Cooperative Living in Brooklyn and served as a consultant for the Brownsville Community Council. Before this, he was education director of the International Association of Machinists Local 397 and Hotel Trades Council in New York. He became a professor at Wayne State University in 1968 and retired in 1985, publishing articles such as \"We Care\" in Kansas: The Non-Professionals Revolt\" in The Nation in 1968 and \"Serving the U.S. Work Force: A New Constituency For Schools of Social Work\" in Journal of Education for Social Work in 1976. He was reportedly denied tenure at Wayne State University because of the high degree of \"advocacy\" in his teaching and field activity. He died on October 13, 1990.

Your\r\nrequest was received in this office on February 20, 2024 and assigned FOIA\r\ntracking number RD 78541.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to the Department of Justice (Record Group 60) file\r\nnumber 146-1-51-3218 on Alexander Efthim, which was referred to by NARA's\r\nTextual Reference division. My initial assessment is that Alexander\r\nChistopher Efthim is the subject of the records. The file was created\r\nbetween May 1951 and June 1955 and consists of an estimated 40 pages.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we conducted a search of all available indexes of records of\r\nthe FBI (Record Group 65) transferred to the National Archives. I\r\nidentified FBI file number 100-HQ-373735 on Alexander Christopher Efthim,\r\ncompiled as part of a Domestic Security investigation, created between\r\nOctober 1950 and September 1974 and consisting of an estimated 100 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA: https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\nYour request does not exceed 700 pages, so it is assigned to our first-tier\r\nprocessing queue. Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we\r\nestimate it will take 39 months to complete processing.\r\n\r\nBecause the results of your FOIA search request comprise two separate\r\nrecord groups, I was instructed to split them into two separate requests.\r\nThe FBI Index Search relating to Alexander Efthim was assigned FOIA\r\ntracking number RD 78720. Please note that though they are assigned\r\ndifferent tracking numbers they will be processed together at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the files at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $112.00.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed. To change your contact\r\ninformation or to track the status of your request, please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov or call 301-837-3190. Please include your FOIA\r\ntracking number in all communications concerning this request.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request and would like the\r\nopportunity to discuss our response, you may contact our FOIA Public\r\nLiaison for assistance:\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Records \u2013 Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Requester Service Center: 301-837-3190\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison: Rebecca Calcagno\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\ndc.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n301-837-3190\r\n\r\nIf you have other questions regarding your request, please contact me\r\ndirectly.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcus Bacher\r\nArchivist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program (RF)\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5510\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nmarcus.bacher@nara.gov\r\n(301) 837-9215\r\nwww.archives.gov/research/foia/",

I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. My primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

My primary purpose is\r\n    to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw\r\n    data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA\r\n    guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested\r\n    information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the\r\n    government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public\r\n    understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily\r\n    in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of\r\n    those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the\r\n    information), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records relating to or mentioning Russian Targeting of Election\r\n    Infrastructure During the 2016 Election, including but not limited to\r\n    emails, memos, drafts, assessments, communications with local and state\r\n    officials, as well as communications with, briefings for and reports to\r\n    Congress.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma Best\n",

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The only redactions in this dataset were columns that contained personally identifying information like names, phone numbers, email addresses, and so on. No row-level information has been redacted. Where a field is blank, that's not a redaction: the underlying dataset did not contain data for that field.\r\n\r\nWe can search for a data dictionary, and we'll get back in touch.\r\n\r\nAs regards Pizza Park, we did not redact or otherwise remove any row-level data from the spreadsheet we sent you. The spreadsheet is a record of various inspections performed by various agencies during the time period specified. OTI wasn't one of those agencies, so we don't have records of why any specific business was or was not inspected.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDominic",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The information you are requesting can be found on our City\r\nwebsite, listed under Flock Camera Transparency Portal.  If there is any\r\nother information you need, please feel free to contact us.  *\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.carmel.ca.us/police-fire\r\n\r\n*We apologize for the delay in this response as the amount of information\r\nrequested was excessive and we were in the process of adding it all to the\r\nportal for the public to view.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*PRA rec'd 2-16-2024 from Muckrock:*\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers\r\n(\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares\r\nALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives\r\nALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares\r\n\u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives\r\n\u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for\r\nextraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant\r\nSolutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the\r\nData Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is\r\navailable through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as\r\nBOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this\r\ninformation (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has\r\ninterpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does\r\nnot exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be\r\nexported through software your agency has already purchased, and is\r\ntherefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following\r\nrecords:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are\r\nalso often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a\r\nCalifornia law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods\r\nJanuary 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information\r\nrequested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and\r\nwould require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and\r\n\u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the\r\ndate this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period\r\nshorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on\r\nyour retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have\r\nthis data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this\r\nrequest is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1\r\nyear, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the\r\nALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola\r\nSolutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report\r\nfunction. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the\r\ntransparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar\r\nfunctionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system\r\nand can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California\r\nPublic Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in\r\nwhich the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public\r\nunderstand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is\r\ncollected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying\r\naccess to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have\r\nprovided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous\r\nyears. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of\r\nthe agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n\r\nPAUL TOMASI\r\n\nChief of Police\r\n\r\nDirector of Public Safety\r\n\r\nCarmel-by-the-Sea Police Department\r\n\r\nP.O.

You requested, \"the signed agreement between the VA and the NAACP.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReasonable Search Dated 3/5/24 & 3/6/24\r\nOn March 5, 2024, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through the VA Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solutions (VIEWS), VA's official System of Record for partnership agreements, for responsive records.  An OSVA FOIA Officer used the search term \"NAACP.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2024, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA Center for Minority Veterans search for and provided all responsive records in its possession. These two (2) searches yielded seven (7) responsive pages.\r\n\r\nNews Media Fee Category\r\nWe have placed you in the news media category.  For this FOIA request, OSVA does not charge any FOIA fees.  OSVA reserves the right to charge FOIA fees for any future FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nInitial Agency Decision\r\nOSVA releases seven (7) pages redacted with FOIA Exemption 6.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) exempts from required disclosure \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"  The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"similar files\" broadly, to include all information that \"applies to a particular individual.\" U.S. Dep't of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982).   FOIA Exemption 6 permits VA to withhold a document or information within a document if disclosure of the information, either by itself or in conjunction with other information available to either the public or the FOIA requester, would result in an unwarranted invasion of an individual's personal privacy without contributing significantly to the public's understanding of the activities of the federal government.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the information being withheld, as indicated on the attached document, under FOIA Exemption 6, consists of the personal signatures of federal employees and partners.  VA releases the names of Senior Executives and federal partners.  Federal employees and partners retain a significant privacy interest under certain circumstances, such as in instances where the release of their information could represent a threat to their well-being, harassment, or their ability to function within their sphere of employment.  The federal employee and partners whose information is at issue have a substantial privacy interest in their personal information.  In weighing the private versus the public interest, we find that there is no public interest in the personal signatures of federal employees and partners.  The coverage of FOIA Exemption 6 is absolute unless the FOIA requester can demonstrate a countervailing public interest in the requested information by demonstrating that the FOIA requester is in a position to provide the requested information to members of the general public and that the information requested contributes significantly to the public's understanding of the activities of the Federal government.  Additionally, the requester must demonstrate how the public's need to understand the information significantly outweighs the privacy interest of the person to whom the information pertains.  Upon consideration of the records, I have not been able to identify a countervailing public interest of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals whose names are redacted.  The protected information has been redacted and (b)(6) inserted.  \"Withholding a telephone number or e-mail address, alone, is not sufficient to protect that [privacy] interest; alternate means of contacting and harassing these employees would be readily discoverable on the Internet if this court ordered their names disclosed.\"  Long v. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160719 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIA Mediation\r\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. Under the provisions of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the following contact information is provided to assist FOIA requesters in resolving disputes:\r\n\r\nVA Central Office FOIA Public Liaison:\r\nName: Darryl Webb\r\nEmail Address: vacofoiaservice@va.gov<mailto:vacofoiaservice@va.gov>\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)\r\nEmail Address: ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nFax: 202-741-5769\r\nMailing address:\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\nThis concludes OSVA's Initial Agency Decision to request 24-06769-F.  Please be advised that should you desire to do so, you may appeal the determination made in this response to:\r\n\r\n                                                                        Office of General Counsel (024)\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\r\nWashington, DC 20420\r\n\r\nIf you should choose to file an appeal, please include a copy of this letter with your written appeal and clearly indicate the basis for your disagreement with the determination set forth in this response.

The Office of the Secretary of State Elections Division maintains election results for races that occur at the district-level or higher; you would need to reach out to the locality or county for the results of a local races.  You can do so by visiting the county election website available at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/links.shtml#County>, or by reaching out to your County Elections Official at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/county.shtml>, or your city officials here<https://directory.tml.org/>.\r\n\r\nElection results maintained by the Office of the Secretary of State can be found on our Historical Election Results page for the years 1992 to 2019 at this link<https://elections.sos.state.tx.us/index.htm> and on our Election Night Results page for 2019 going forward at this link<https://results.texas-election.com/landing-page>.  After the completion of the statewide canvass, these results will become available for download under the \u201cReports\u201d tab in PDF or Excel format.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding voter turnout and registration statistics is available on our Election Results page at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/historical/index.shtml>.
