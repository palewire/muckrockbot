I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Christopher O. Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996). Mr. Bird was a New York Times best-selling author who co-wrote \"The Secret Life of Plants: A Fascinating Account of the Physical, Emotional and Spiritual Relations Between Plants and Men\" with journalist Peter Tompkins in 1973. According to his New York Times obituary, attached, Mr. Bird served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media. A fee waiver is appropriate where disclosure of requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. Per Mr. Bird's obituary, he was in the Army at some point during the 1960s and/or the 1970s, based on the reference to the Vietnam War. This is important because he may have been on active-duty or in the reserve when his book \"The Secret Life of Plants\" was published. In the book, Mr. Bird discusses extrasensory perception and other unusual phenomena. Between 1972 and 1995, the Army was one of several branches of the military that participated in research involving extrasensory perception and remote viewing, first in collaboration with the Stanford Research Institute (later SRI International) and then as part of a program organized under the Defense Intelligence Agency known as the Star Gate Project. Mr. Bird's Army records would contribute greatly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the Army in this area, both in regard to the type of work the Army may have contributed to Star Gate (the program was discontinued in 1995) and possible budget appropriations for defense spending.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Bird's privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll documents, materials, recordings and other material discoverable under the Florida Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure concerning the Governor and Ashley Moody's conspiracy in 2021 and 2022 intending further obstruction of justice of matters before Federal and State Courts as set forth in the below Department of Justice complaint (the full complaint along with the recipient list is attached hereto and at https://desantisfelonycoverupcorruption.wordpress.com/2023/04/16/desantis-criminal-complaint-obstruction-of-justice/ ),\r\n\r\n[see attached file for the full version of the D.O.J. criminal complaint with embedded links - below is text only - no links]\r\n\r\nCriminal complaint:\r\n\r\nDeSantis, a Yale and Harvard law graduate and Guantanamo  \"JAG\" may have engaged in Obstruction of Justice or accessory after-the-fact concerning a lifetime threat prohibiting the service of court documents to the entire State of Florida government.   \r\n\r\nThe communication prohibition was set forth to DeSantis in State court litigation in 2021 and 2022 whereby DeSantis was a defendant,  \r\nHuminski v. DeSantis, Et al., Florida 11th Circuit Court, 21-CA-18435 (lead defendant State of Florida)\r\n\r\nHuminski v. DeSantis, Et al., Florida 3rd District Court of Appeal, 3d21-1920\r\nThe Complaint in 21-CA-18435 contains the following text from a Florida Supreme Court filing along with per se evidence of prosecutorial forgery (pages 22-35 in link) of a court order used to initiate a contempt case (State v. Huminski) ,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis excerpt is grounded upon the following excerpt from a court order in State v. Huminski, 17-MM-815, forbidding communication, including service of court papers upon Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody which is part of the record in the aforementioned 2021-2022 State Court cases against DeSantis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis perpetual threat memorialized in the above court order prohibiting any communication with the entire State of Florida government (pages 63-64 in link) - FOR LIFE - is what DeSantis obsessively defended and sought to make permanent in 2021 and 2022.  \r\n\r\nDeSantis also defended the forgery by State's Attorney Amira Fox in his 2021-2022 defense filings that ultimately maintained the perpetual gag order protecting the entire State of Florida government from communication and service of court papers and perpetuated the fruits of the prosecutorial forgery of a court order enriching the State of Florida treasury.\r\n\r\nDuring this time period, notable is DeSantis' removal of State's Attorney Andrew Warren for his positions on LGBTQ and abortion issues while the governor was concurrently supporting the forgery of a Court order by G.O.P. State's Attorney Amira Fox that she used to initiate contempt case State v. Huminski and ultimately secured a lifetime speech prohibition gag order intending to obstruct the service of process upon Florida government attorneys including herself and the Florida Attorney General. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe cases that were obstructed by DeSantis' support, defense and cover-up of the lifetime speech prohibition intending to foil service upon Florida Attorney General, Amira Fox and government attorneys are (partial list),\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned 2021-2022 cases, Huminski v. DeSantis (lead defendant - State of Florida)\r\nAndrew Warren v. DeSantis, Florida Supreme Court, SC23-247\r\n Andrew Warren v. DeSantis, U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, 23-10459, Atlanta, GA\r\nEquality Florida v. DeSantis, U.S. District Court (Northern District of Florida), 4:22-cv-00134-AW-MJF\r\nThomas Kennedy v. DeSantis, U.S. Distict Court (Souther District of Florida), 1:22-cv-21827-KMW\r\nAndrew Warren v. DeSantis, U.S. District Court (Northern District of Florida), 4:22-cv-00302-RH-MAF\r\nAs a proximate result of the above gag order prohibiting speech with the entire government of Florida supported wholeheartedly by DeSantis and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody (DeSantis' attorney on the cases) in 2021-2022, service of court papers in the above listed 7 State and Federal court cases were obstructed in this conspiracy to violate rights and obstruct justice between DeSantis and his attorney general.  Serious official felonies under Federal and State law.  The impact upon the federal case in Georgia brings in an interstate element to the continuing crimes.\r\n\r\nWhere was DeSantis' ivy-league law education in 2021-2022 concerning the crimes of forgery, Obstruction of Justice and the obvious and implicit threat of prosecution and incarceration for contempt of a court order if the perpetual speech gag order is violated?\r\n\r\nIn a light most favorable to DeSantis, perhaps the above content does not set forth an accessory after-the-fact concerning felony Obstruction of Justice or forgery.  The inquiry then becomes why did DeSantis remove a progressive prosecutor, Andrew Warren, for his positions on LGBTQ and abortion issues while, at the same time, appointing Amira Fox to positions after her forgery of a Court order and per se Obstruction of Justice related to Federal and State court matters that pleased the Governor? \r\n\r\nA strong quid pro quo exists between DeSantis and his favorite GOP prosecutor, Amira Fox, who protected DeSantis' first major law enforcement appointee, Broward Sheriff Tony, from perjury charges.  Much more than party affiliation is behind DeSantis' motivations related to the forgery of a court order by Amira Fox and the gag order that was a product of the forgery.  A fruit of a very poisonous tree.\r\n\r\nAmira Fox's assistant in charge of the forgery and gag order request committed suicide 30 days after this corruption was detailed in federal court in Equality Florida v. DeSantis.  Amira Fox has admitted full responsibility for these official crimes in her own words here and here.  Not coincidently, Fox's deceased assistant who obeyed her order to forge court orders and seek a gag order was also the prosecutor who let DeSantis' appointee, Broward Sheriff Tony, off the hook for obvious perjury.\r\n\r\nSee https://desantisfelonycoverupcorruption.wordpress.com/2023/04/16/desantis-criminal-complaint-obstruction-of-justice/\r\n\r\nThe distribution list of this criminal complaint is as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom: scott huminski <s_huminski@live.com>\r\nSent: Sunday, April 16, 2023 1:28 PM\r\nTo: JCabou@perkinscoie.com <JCabou@perkinscoie.com>;
