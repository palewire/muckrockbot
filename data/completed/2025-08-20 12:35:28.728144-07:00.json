Specifically, I am seeking electronic payroll/salary information for all individuals employed within all public schools and their districts for all fiscal years during this period. \r\n\r\nFor each year and payroll, I am seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) [not paper records or a PDF created from data] with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, job title and code, subjects taught, school level (K-12, kindergarten, etc.), teaching certificates, measure of teaching quality (teacher evaluations of value-added of teacher), employment status (full-time/part-time/leave of absence), hire date or years of experiences, termination date, contract type (contracted/regular/temporary/student employee), and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables. \r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if school districts or job titles are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so. \r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Rudenberg, a citizen of Delaware, in coordination with Kaleb Houle-Lawrence.",

Vanderhoef,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response and for outlining the confidentiality laws that govern the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs a family member directly affected by these cases and investigations, I believe I meet the criteria under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35 and relevant statutory exceptions to access the requested records. This request is made to ensure transparency and accountability in the handling of investigations involving my family members. Specifically, I am concerned about the potential for misconduct, including whether Heather Stertz may have been involved in covering up fraud related to FoodShare, BadgerCare, childcare, and unemployment benefits. It is vital to assess the integrity of the findings to address any potential harm caused by improper handling.\r\n\r\nI will promptly complete and return the release of information form to fulfill your procedural requirements. If any part of the requested records is withheld or redacted, I respectfully request a written explanation citing the specific exemptions relied upon.\r\n\r\nShould you require any further information to process my request, please do not hesitate to contact me back via Muckrock.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and cooperation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAlex Lennon",

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952. Thank you for your assistance. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDillon Bergin",

I am conducting research but it likely does not technically qualify as academic research. \r\n\r\nPlease waive the fee if possible and if not then contact with any fee over 10 dollars as you noted. \r\n\r\nI'm very sorry about the error. This was a template that I copied and pasted and made some quick adjustments to without due consideration to the academic research technical qualifications of fee waiver. I'm sorry about that mistake. \r\n\r\nThank you so much again.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJustin Kashuba",

I was quoted a rough estimate of $400 for the digital evidence on 6/25/2024, but at the time I declined to move forward with the digital evidence portion and the request was closed. I would now like to move forward with digital evidence and I'm writing to request an invoice. Also, would it be possible for me to get an index or list of contents for the digital evidence portion, so I would know in advance what it will contain? Is there any other material in this case? Would the State's Attorney's office be able to help me with further discovery documents?\r\nMany thanks for your help,\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMikita Brottman",

Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 98 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 947 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,011 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,360 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I am seeking copies of calendar entries for events that were held or proposed. I am not seeking a search of records held by students or student organizations. I am only seeking information held by the university administration (for example, in an Event Management System, which may be helpful in providing a list of past events and proposed future events). \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear or if I could clarify it in any way, please don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nI request:\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member during the final two weeks of each term during 2023, 2024, and Winter/Spring 2025. If your institution's academic calendar does not identify a final date of a given term, please use the final day of exams for the term as the final day of the term.\r\n\r\n2. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m., between January 31, 2023 and July 1, 2025.\r\n\r\n3. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be held after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m. This request is limited to events that are proposed to be held between July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. \r\n\r\n4. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be during the final two weeks of a term in the Fall 2025, Winter 2025-2026, or Spring 2026 semesters/terms. Please us the same means of calculating \"final two weeks\" as in (1), above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

I am seeking copies of calendar entries for events that were held or proposed. I am not seeking a search of records held by students or student organizations. I am only seeking information held by the university administration (for example, in an Event Management System, which may be helpful in providing a list of past events and proposed future events). \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear or if I could clarify it in any way, please don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nI request:\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member during the final two weeks of each term during 2023, 2024, and Winter/Spring 2025. If your institution's academic calendar does not identify a final date of a given term, please use the final day of exams for the term as the final day of the term.\r\n\r\n2. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m., between January 31, 2023 and July 1, 2025.\r\n\r\n3. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be held after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m. This request is limited to events that are proposed to be held between July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. \r\n\r\n4. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be during the final two weeks of a term in the Fall 2025, Winter 2025-2026, or Spring 2026 semesters/terms. Please us the same means of calculating \"final two weeks\" as in (1), above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

If any records are located, they will also need to be reviewed for redactions. The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation, and Reentry (ADCRR) has a statutory mandate to redact all records as necessary per A.R.S. \u00a7 31-221(C). Because of this mandate, this process can sometimes be time consuming. We appreciate your continued patience. We will notify you once the responsive records, if any are located, are ready for production. Should the records no longer be needed, please advise us so we may withdraw your request and close accordingly .\u00a0If you have any questions, or wish to discuss this further, please contact us.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

You requested the following: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nIn Board Policy 408.1, it states: \r\n\r\n\"If an application for waiver is denied, then the principal must mail a copy of the decision, stating the reason for the denial, to the parents or guardians within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the request.\" \r\n\r\nProvide the denial letters for student fee waivers distributed in the 2024/2025 school year from the following schools: \r\n\r\nAmundsen \r\nChicago Academy \r\nDevry \r\nDisney II ES \r\nDisney II HS \r\nForeman \r\nGraham HS \r\nKelvyn Park \r\nLake View \r\nLane Tech \r\nLincoln Park \r\nMarine Leadership at Ames \r\nMather \r\nNorthside Learning \r\nNorthside Prep \r\nRoosevelt \r\nSchurz \r\nSenn \r\nSteinmetz \r\nSullivan \r\nTaft \r\nUplift \r\nVaughn \r\nVon Steuben \r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency. \r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of The FOIA Bakery. Because this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c).

Please note that student school fee waivers are a student-by-student basis and would require that the identified schools manually review thousands of student files to determine if a school fee waiver was requested and if a denial letter was provided. \r\nThus, your request does not reasonably identify a public record for search. Under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general documents or information to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Additionally, the FOIA does not require a public body to conduct research or answer questions on your behalf. \r\nAccordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989); see also Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922) (\u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d). \r\nFurther, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files).

This information may be gathered together in a single document like a data dictionary, entity layout, or user's guide. If that is the case, I request access to and copy of said document. Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nData format \r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Dillon Bergin.",
