All other employees are in a CBA.\r\n\r\nFollow Up: Is it possible to get a copy of that? The current one does not show non-faculty positions with the salaries\r\n\r\n2.

The only releasable case was uploaded to the portal, along with a copy of the AG's ruling on 24-1791. I am still waiting on HR to get back with whether or not there is any reprimands in his file and will write again once they get back with me.***** For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any communications, on or after April 1, 2025, concerning the planned appearance by Ryan Holiday on April 14, 2025, as reported in this New York Times piece: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/naval-academy-speech-censorship.html.\r\n\r\n2. Any communications, on or after April 1, 2025, concerning the cancellation, postponement, or rescheduling of Ryan Holiday's April 14, 2025 appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the removal of books from a library due to their viewpoints or content and the cancellation of a speech on the basis that discussion of those books (or their removal) might violate an order of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted media coverage, including the Associated Press report identified above. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the cancellation of a speech based on its contents or viewpoint.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations. That information is not in the public domain and relates to a decision that has received attention from a prominent newspaper.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request all records related to Gen. John Kirk Singlaub. Singlaub was born July 10, 1921 in what is now Independence, California, USA. He died January 29, 2022.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT:\r\n\r\nIn May 1977, Singlaub (then the Army's third-ranking official on the Korean Peninsula) spoke out publicly against President Carter's decision to withdraw 32,000 ground troops from the Korean Peninsula.\r\n\r\nGen. Singlaub started the U.S. Council for World Freedom, an affiliate of the World Anti-Communist League. In addition, Gen. Singlaub was involved with the Western Goals Foundation, a private domestic intelligence group bankrolled by conservative Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt to gather information on leftist groups and their leaders. Gen. Singlaub\u2019s chief function in what the Los Angeles Times called the business of \u201cprivate-enterprise insurgency\u201d was raising millions of dollars to supply arms to anti-communist paramilitaries in places such as Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and Laos. He was also the chairman of the OSS Society, a group that seeks to preserve the legacy of the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. In the early 1980s, as Congress began curtailing U.S. funding of efforts to overthrow leftist regimes in Nicaragua and elsewhere, Gen. Singlaub and his organizations remained an important conduit of materiel and financial assistance to right-wing paramilitaries, reportedly with the help of deep-pocketed conservatives and foreign governments.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: \r\n\r\nIn addition to standard practices, please search the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nPlease include a cross-reference search of the following things to see if they contain additional records related to Gen. Singlaub: U.S. COUNCIL FOR WORLD FREEDOM, WORLD ANTI-COMMUNIST LEAGUE, WESTERN GOALS FOUNDATION, OSS SOCIETY\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Gen. Singlaub has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Gen. Singlaub was a public figure. News obituaries for Gen. Singlaub appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Gen. Singlaub has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Gen. Singlaub's status as a U.S. Army General, a public figure, and a private funder of right-wing paramilitaries, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor, \r\n  \r\n The St. Charles City Police Department Records Division received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo on Wednesday, June 4, 2025.  \r\n  \r\n Your request reference number is Request Number: PD2025-382  \r\n Your security key is 94DB11EF  \r\n  \r\n Please have both reference numbers available when communicating with our staff regarding your request.  \r\n  \r\n Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. This department is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three-business-day period. \u00a7 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n \r\nEstimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within seven business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. We will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within seven business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than seven business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. \r\n \r\nBilling: \r\nThis department will charge fees for copies and research time required for fulfilling records requests at the actual cost of research time. \u00a7 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items.\" Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. \r\n \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. This department will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. \u00a7 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\n \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. \r\n  \r\n Thank you,  \r\n  \r\n Saint Charles Police Department \r\n1781 Zumbehl Road\r\nSaint Charles, MO 63303 \r\n(636) 940-4619",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

The purpose of this letter is to ask that you clarify or narrow your request by providing us with more information about the particular records you seek. The following paragraph highlights the aspect of your request that we find to be unclear or overly broad. \r\n \r\nWe need clarification of what your request is looking for in light of UT Austin's unique relationships with ProQuest and the eBook Central platform. UT Austin does have a license agreement with ProQuest that is dated in 2017, but we do not make any eBook-related purchases pursuant to that agreement. That 2017 ProQuest agreement is used by UT Austin to purchase databases and archives, while all of UT Austin's eBook purchases and plans are acquired through other vendors. We purchase eBooks and eBook plans through a vendor called GOBI and we purchase a subscription to eBook Central through the TexShare consortium. In light of these facts, please explain exactly which agreements and procurement documentation you'd like to receive. \r\n \r\nPlease let us know how you wish to proceed. Upon receipt of your response, we will resume work on your request.\u00a0 You may deliver your response by replying to this email or by any one of the following means: \r\n \r\nBy U.S. Mail: \r\nAttn:\u00a0 Open Records Coordinator \r\nOffice of the Vice President for Legal Affairs \r\nThe University of Texas at Austin \r\nP.O.

Communications and Correspondence\r\nAll documents, records, communications, correspondence, emails, memoranda, letters, text messages, instant messages, and electronic communications of any kind between any IDFPR employee, contractor, or agent and any representative, employee, or agent of the Illinois Professionals Health Program (IPHP) from January 1, 2019 to the date of this request.\r\n2. Agreements and Contracts\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, service agreements, referral agreements, formal arrangements, informal arrangements, and documents establishing any relationship between IDFPR and IPHP from January 1, 2019 to present.\r\n3. IPHP-Related Documentation\r\nAll documents, records, files, reports, studies, evaluations, assessments, policies, procedures, guidelines, protocols, and materials of any kind that contain any reference to, mention of, or discussion of the Illinois Professionals Health Program, IPHP, physician health programs, physician monitoring programs, or impaired physician programs from January 1, 2019 to present.\r\n4. Meeting Records\r\nAll meeting minutes, agendas, notes, recordings, transcripts, and records from any meeting, conference call, or discussion where IPHP, physician health programs, physician monitoring, or impaired physicians were discussed from January 1, 2019 to present.\r\n5. Digital Communications Search\r\nAll electronic records, regardless of format or storage location, containing any of the following terms in the subject line, title, filename, or content:\r\n\r\n\"Illinois Professionals Health Program\"\r\n\"IPHP\"\r\n\"physician health\"\r\n\"physician monitoring\"\r\n\"impaired physician\"\r\n\"substance abuse monitoring\"\r\n\"behavioral health monitoring\"\r\n\r\nFORMAT AND SCOPE CLARIFICATIONS\r\nFormat: I request all responsive records in their native electronic format. For emails, please include all metadata, attachments, and embedded images.\r\nTime Period: January 1, 2019 through the date of processing this request.\r\nFee Agreement: I agree to pay all reasonable copying and processing fees. Given that government records are increasingly maintained in digital format, I expect processing costs to be minimal as no physical copying should be required.\r\nBurden Mitigation: To minimize any claimed administrative burden:\r\n\r\nI do not require redaction of exempt information; you may produce records with exempt portions clearly marked\r\nI do not require organization or categorization of responsive records\r\nI accept production on a rolling basis as records are located\r\nElectronic delivery is preferred to minimize processing time and costs\r\n\r\nLEGAL NOTES\r\nClarification on Request Nature: This request seeks existing records and documents only, regardless of their internal titles, filing designations, or naming conventions. I am not requesting answers to questions or asking IDFPR to provide explanations, analyses, or opinions. Per Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28 (1989), I am requesting inspection and copying of existing public records, not interrogatory-style responses. The records sought are whatever documents exist in your possession relating to the specified topics, regardless of what they may be titled or how they are categorized in your filing systems.\r\nNo Record Creation Required: This request seeks existing records only and does not ask IDFPR to create, compile, or analyze any information. The request uses standard FOIA terminology and seeks clearly identifiable categories of records that any regulatory agency would reasonably maintain regarding entities it oversees or works with.\r\nThe requested records relate to matters of significant public interest regarding physician oversight and patient safety. Transparency in regulatory relationships serves the public interest in understanding how physician monitoring is conducted in Illinois.\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TIMELINE\r\nPlease respond within the statutory timeframe. If you need additional time to locate responsive records, please provide a written estimate of when records will be available and the basis for any delay.\r\nIf you determine that any requested records are exempt from disclosure, please provide a detailed explanation citing the specific statutory exemption and explain why the exemption applies to each withheld record.\r\nIf you claim no responsive records exist, please provide a written explanation of the search methodology used and the systems/locations searched.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelivery Preference: Electronic delivery preferred\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nSincerely,\r\nVig Sinclair\r\nMedical Researcher\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nVig Sinclair",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence between the ATF and FAA regarding deployment of  acquisition of unmanned aerial systems or unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly known as \"drones\") by the ATF's National Response Team.\r\n\r\nThe OIG report published on March 25, 2015 noted: \"Less than a week after ATF\u2019s Special Operations Division suspended its UAS program, ATF\u2019s National Response Team (NRT) purchased five small, commercially available UAS at a total cost of about $15,000. The NRT acquired these UAS, which each weigh approximately three pounds, to help document fire and explosion crime scenes. NRT officials told us they used one of these units to conduct one brief UAS flight in July 2014 to document the aftermath of a Louisiana apartment fire that resulted in the deaths of three residents. However, NRT officials stated that after this use, they became aware that they were required to obtain an FAA COA before operating UAS. These officials told us they then contacted TOB regarding UAS requirements and subsequently grounded their UAS until they obtained further clarification and guidance on deployment requirements.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a request for all such correspondence among the ATF, the NRT and the FAA regarding the need for a UAS COA.\r\n\r\nGiven that this FOIA is submitted in my capacity as a journalist who has covered drones extensively, I request that I be categorized as a media requester for the purpose of fees. Here is a selection of my published articles on drones:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jan/12/how-843-lbs-seized-pot-lead-customs-and-border-pro/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/mar/03/us-marshals-service-conceal-key-details-millions-s/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/27/while-dodging-direct-question-fbi-commits-obama-st/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/27/while-dodging-direct-question-fbi-commits-obama-st/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/12/fbi-and-justice-department-cant-find-drone-privacy/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jan/22/air-force-knows-how-many-mq-9-drones-it-wants-cant/\r\n\r\nI have also been published in a number of national media outlets on topics including drones and other matters pertaining to national security and technologies:\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-us-spent-360-million-on-border-drones-thanks-to-this-flimsy-report\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-air-force-says-it-needs-precisely-52-new-reaper-drones-cant-explain-why\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/do-the-fbis-drones-invade-your-privacy-sorry-thats-private\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/08/big-brother-better-police-work-new-technology-automatically-runs-license-plates-everyone/1qoAoFfgp31UnXZT2CsFSK/story.html\r\n\r\nwww.betaboston.com/news/2014/03/05/a-vast-hidden-surveillance-network-runs-across-america-powered-by-the-repo-industry/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/05/nypd-social-media-policy-allows-catfishing-with-the-proper-paperwork.html\r\n\r\nhttps://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/03/the-pentagon-finally-details-its-weapons-for-cops-giveaway\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/do-the-fbis-drones-invade-your-privacy-sorry-thats-private\r\n\r\nhttps://news.vice.com/article/fbi-agent-who-killed-boston-bombing-suspects-friend-was-twice-accused-of-police-brutality\r\n\r\nAs the requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com and pertains to a matter of considerable public interest, I further request a full waiver of all fees.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nShawn Musgrave",

Please let me know when I can expect to receive a response. You had assigned it reference number #2015-0737. This communication was originally to foiamail@atf.gov. Please see the following request. \r\n---\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence between the ATF and FAA regarding deployment of acquisition of unmanned aerial systems or unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly known as \"drones\") by the ATF's National Response Team.\r\n\r\nThe OIG report published on March 25, 2015 noted: \"Less than a week after ATF\u2019s Special Operations Division suspended its UAS program, ATF\u2019s National Response Team (NRT) purchased five small, commercially available UAS at a total cost of about $15,000. The NRT acquired these UAS, which each weigh approximately three pounds, to help document fire and explosion crime scenes. NRT officials told us they used one of these units to conduct one brief UAS flight in July 2014 to document the aftermath of a Louisiana apartment fire that resulted in the deaths of three residents. However, NRT officials stated that after this use, they became aware that they were required to obtain an FAA COA before operating UAS. These officials told us they then contacted TOB regarding UAS requirements and subsequently grounded their UAS until they obtained further clarification and guidance on deployment requirements.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a request for all such correspondence among the ATF, the NRT and the FAA regarding the need for a UAS COA.\r\n\r\nGiven that this FOIA is submitted in my capacity as a journalist who has covered drones extensively, I request that I be categorized as a media requester for the purpose of fees. Here is a selection of my published articles on drones:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jan/12/how-843-lbs-seized-pot-lead-customs-and-border-pro/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/mar/03/us-marshals-service-conceal-key-details-millions-s/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/27/while-dodging-direct-question-fbi-commits-obama-st/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/27/while-dodging-direct-question-fbi-commits-obama-st/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/12/fbi-and-justice-department-cant-find-drone-privacy/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jan/22/air-force-knows-how-many-mq-9-drones-it-wants-cant/\r\n\r\nI have also been published in a number of national media outlets on topics including drones and other matters pertaining to national security and technologies:\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-us-spent-360-million-on-border-drones-thanks-to-this-flimsy-report\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-air-force-says-it-needs-precisely-52-new-reaper-drones-cant-explain-why\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/do-the-fbis-drones-invade-your-privacy-sorry-thats-private\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/08/big-brother-better-police-work-new-technology-automatically-runs-license-plates-everyone/1qoAoFfgp31UnXZT2CsFSK/story.html\r\n\r\nwww.betaboston.com/news/2014/03/05/a-vast-hidden-surveillance-network-runs-across-america-powered-by-the-repo-industry/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/05/nypd-social-media-policy-allows-catfishing-with-the-proper-paperwork.html\r\n\r\nhttps://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/03/the-pentagon-finally-details-its-weapons-for-cops-giveaway\r\n\r\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/do-the-fbis-drones-invade-your-privacy-sorry-thats-private\r\n\r\nhttps://news.vice.com/article/fbi-agent-who-killed-boston-bombing-suspects-friend-was-twice-accused-of-police-brutality\r\n\r\nAs the requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com and pertains to a matter of considerable public interest, I further request a full waiver of all fees.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am requesting the e-mail messages to, from, or carbon copying any of the below-listed USCIS employees dated between 07/09/2018 and the present date mentioning the following keywords: \"denaturaliz*\" \"operation janus\" or \"operation second look\". \r\n\r\nPlease note that I am using the asterisk (*) to designate the standard use of \u201cwildcards\u201d in the search for responsive records. For example, a search for \u201cdenaturaliz*\u201d would return all of the following: denaturalize, denaturalization, denaturalized, etc. If you are unable to search for wildcards, please advise so that I may specifically include the variations I would like searched.\r\n\r\nThis request can be fulfilled by searching the e-mail accounts of the USCIS employees (\"Custodians\") below using each of the above-listed keywords, which should include e-mail messages where any of their respective e-mail addresses are found in the \"To,\" \"From,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" fields. \r\n\r\nCustodians: \r\nThe search can be completed by searching the e-mail for the following Custodians:   \r\nL. Francis Cissna, Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\r\nTracy Renaud, Acting Deputy Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\r\nTodd Young, Acting Chief of Staff, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\r\nCraig Symons, Chief, Office of Chief Counsel, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\r\nMariela Melero, Associate Director, Customer Service and Public Engagement\r\nKevin Kerns, Acting Associate Director, Management Directorate\r\nMatthew D. Emrich, Associate Director, Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate\r\nDaniel Renaud, Associate Director, Field Operations Directorate\r\nTammy Meckley, Associate Director, Immigration Records and Identity Services Directorate\r\nBill McElhaney, Chief Information Officer\r\nKathy Nuebel Kovarik, Chief, Office of Policy and Strategy, and\r\nLora Ries, Acting Associate Director, External Affairs Directorate.\r\n\r\n2. In addition to the records requested above, I also request records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request. If you use FOIA questionnaires or certifications completed by individual custodians or components to determine whether they possess responsive materials or to describe how they conducted searches, I also request any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016). \r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms. \r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive media coverage of and public attention on the administration\u2019s new denaturalization task force and efforts to denaturalize US citizens. See Scanning immigrants\u2019 old fingerprints, U.S. threatens to strip thousands of citizenship (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/scanning-immigrants-old-fingerprints-us-threatens-to-strip-thousands-of citizenship/2018/06/13/2230d8a2-6f2e-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html?utm_term=.171a50a5bf43); Trump Creates \u2018Denaturalization\u2019 Task Force to Pursue Deportation Against Thousands of U.S. Citizens (https://www.theroot.com/trump-creates-denaturalization-task-force-to-pursue-d-1827372139); Surely the Trump Administration Will Follow All the Rules When Stripping People of Citizenship (https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a22061884/denaturalization-task-force-trump-citizenship/); Trump Administration Launches Effort to Strip Citizenship From Those Suspected of Naturalization Irregularities (https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-administration-launches-denaturalization-effort-to-strip-citizenship-from-those-suspected-of-irregularities.html); APNewsBreak: US launches bid to find citizenship cheaters (https://apnews.com/1da389a535684a5f9d0da74081c242f3). This request goes directly to this action by the federal government. \r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched denaturalization issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I am quoted in a number of the articles listed above and intend to use the documents and information received in response to this request to share with the public and to write related news articles about denaturalization. \r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, the articles listed above describe a new task force seeking to strip citizenship from naturalized citizen based on a secret memo not yet released to the public and under a rubric that is unclear. While Cissna has said in multiple interviews he anticipates the filing of \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases, the FY2019 ICE budget states that only 855 of the fingerprint cards from Operation Janus and Operation Second Look are being considered for prosecution. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47. The original 2016 OIG report that started this process said there were 858 such cases. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2016/OIG-16-130-Sep16.pdf. Either way, the prospect that the new task force will file \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases raises serious concerns that Cissna's claims about the intentions and basis for denaturalization are being actively misstated in his interviews withe media. The FY2019 ICE budget also says the agency is looking to review 700,000 additional alien files for denaturalization, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47, while there were only 315,000 non-digitized fingerprint cards. Again, the numbers do not add up, and the notion that USCIS is planning \"thousands\" of denaturalizations while claiming all such cases arise from the mis-matched fingerprint cards is especially problematic. \r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated where perhaps 700,000 US Citizens would be at risk of losing their citizenship. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the USCIS should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock",

Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive media coverage of and public attention on the administration\u2019s new denaturalization task force and efforts to denaturalize US citizens. See Scanning immigrants\u2019 old fingerprints, U.S. threatens to strip thousands of citizenship (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/scanning-immigrants-old-fingerprints-us-threatens-to-strip-thousands-of citizenship/2018/06/13/2230d8a2-6f2e-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html?utm_term=.171a50a5bf43); Trump Creates \u2018Denaturalization\u2019 Task Force to Pursue Deportation Against Thousands of U.S. Citizens (https://www.theroot.com/trump-creates-denaturalization-task-force-to-pursue-d-1827372139); Surely the Trump Administration Will Follow All the Rules When Stripping People of Citizenship (https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a22061884/denaturalization-task-force-trump-citizenship/); Trump Administration Launches Effort to Strip Citizenship From Those Suspected of Naturalization Irregularities (https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-administration-launches-denaturalization-effort-to-strip-citizenship-from-those-suspected-of-irregularities.html); APNewsBreak: US launches bid to find citizenship cheaters (https://apnews.com/1da389a535684a5f9d0da74081c242f3). This request goes directly to this action by the federal government.\r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched denaturalization issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I am quoted in a number of the articles listed above and intend to use the documents and information received in response to this request to share with the public and to write related news articles about denaturalization.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request:\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, the articles listed above describe a new task force seeking to strip citizenship from naturalized citizen based on a secret memo not yet released to the public and under a rubric that is unclear. While Cissna has said in multiple interviews he anticipates the filing of \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases, the FY2019 ICE budget states that only 855 of the fingerprint cards from Operation Janus and Operation Second Look are being considered for prosecution. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47. The original 2016 OIG report that started this process said there were 858 such cases. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2016/OIG-16-130-Sep16.pdf. Either way, the prospect that the new task force will file \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases raises serious concerns that Cissna's claims about the intentions and basis for denaturalization are being actively misstated in his interviews withe media. The FY2019 ICE budget also says the agency is looking to review 700,000 additional alien files for denaturalization, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47, while there were only 315,000 non-digitized fingerprint cards. Again, the numbers do not add up, and the notion that USCIS is planning \"thousands\" of denaturalizations while claiming all such cases arise from the mis-matched fingerprint cards is especially problematic.\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated where perhaps 700,000 US Citizens would be at risk of losing their citizenship. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the USCIS should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock",

I understand the need to protect personal identifying information, however, as a follow-up to my previous request, I would like to request the release of any additional parts of the Accident Report related to this case that do not contain personal identifying information. \r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting the following additional materials (if available): Sections of the Accident Report that provide a detailed account of the circumstances and factors leading to the accident with redactions as necessary for privacy. (Or any supplemental police reports, including: officer narrative descriptions, witness statements with redactions as necessary for privacy, any additional investigative notes.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to inquire whether, based on the information provided by the DC Government's Vision Zero Crash Dashboard (https://visionzero.dc.gov/pages/crash-analysis#analysis), which visualizes data from the MPD, it is accurate to assume that this specific crash resulted in only a minor injury. I have attached a screenshot from the dashboard that presents data related to this accident for your reference.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request mentioned: To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the DC Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nA copy of the PD-10 Accident Report OR any other publicly releasable records related to a bicycle-vehicle collision that occurred on the evening of November 1, 2024, at approximately 7:00 PM, at the intersection of Constitution Ave NW and 3rd Street NW in Washington, D.C (near 301 Constitution Ave). The CCN number for this accident is 24170107. I was present at the scene and, while not directly involved, I am seeking information and a narrative description on the incident to understand what occurred and to confirm the condition of the cyclist who was struck and the severity of the crash. I understand that certain details may be redacted due to privacy concerns, and I am requesting as much information as can be made available to a third party. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPatrik Adri\u00e1n Szigeti \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmetropolitan-police-department-385%252Fnovember-1-2024-accident-report-182115%252F%253Femail%253Dfoia.admin%252540dc.gov&url_auth_token=AAAVLaAf_DejsiTBEUWZ8ZPYrJc%3A1tnTNM%3A6gzMQ9viXvJW8wk2gpoMN69ksz0VTO2VoHufBjDe1D4 Upon review of your request, it has been determined that a final response was provided on February 28, 2025.\u00a0 You are a third-party to this incident, and THEREFORE nothing further will be provided.
