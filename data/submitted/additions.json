Specifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nEmails sent or received between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, by any Legislator or their staff containing the phrase \"fair work week\" in the message text or attachments, excluding internal advisory communications.

But if there are any fees associated with fulfilling this request, please provide an estimate of these costs before proceeding. If my request is unclear or too broad, I would appreciate your assistance in narrowing the scope.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response as soon as practicable or within five business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\r\nc/o MuckRock News\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\npeter.fugiel@rutgers.edu\r\n260-468-8528",
