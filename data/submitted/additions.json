As partygoers exited into the parking lot, multiple fights broke out, leading to the arrest of several juveniles and Jasmin Marie Watkins. Watkins was charged with rioting, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest for allegedly inciting the crowd and threatening an officer. Additional law enforcement agencies were called to assist, and pepper ball guns were noted as available to officers on the scene. Reports also indicated possible gunfire in the area.\r\nI am requesting copies of body-worn camera footage from officers who were present during the response, crowd dispersal, arrests, and any interactions with Jasmin Marie Watkins and the juveniles involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
