We are requesting data starting in 2003 through the most recent year with full data availability in the TSLED and AA systems.\r\n\r\nFrom our research we believe this data is collected by various New York State law enforcement agencies and processed with the Traffic and Criminal Software (TraCS). Furthermore, based on the New York State FFY 2024 - 2026 Triennial Highway Safety Plan [found here: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2023-10/NY_FY24HSP-tag.pdf] we have reason to believe that UTT data from TraCS is sent electronically to a central repository, maintained by the NYS ITS (Office of Information Technology Services) before being delivered from the repository to the NYS DMV. Furthermore, based on the Dec. '19 TraCS System Study [found here: http://fltrafficrecords.com/pdf/TraCS%20System%20Study%20-%20Final%20Report%20with%20Appendices.pdf] for the Florida Department of Transportation State Safety Office that New York State Police participated in, we believe that electronic UTT data was first collected via TraCS in 2003 and about 67% of all vehicle tickets given out in New York State are process through TraCS and in the TSLED and AA.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, based on our knowledge the following forms/sections in TraCS should contain some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the UTT data we are requesting:\r\n\"Violations\"\r\n\"Individual\"\r\n\"Vehicle\"\r\n\"Location\"\r\n\"Court\"\r\n\"Sub Dep\"\r\n\"OfficersNotes\"\r\n\"Attach 1\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these are some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the detailed data values that are collected in the TraCS system that we are requesting:\r\n\"Ticket Number\"\r\n\"Police Agency\"\r\n\"Sequence #\"\r\n\"Local Police Code\"\r\n\"Photo Lic Shown\"\r\n\"Last Name(Defendant)\"\r\n\"First Name\"\r\n\"MI\"\r\n\"Suffix\"\r\n\"Number and Street\"\r\n\"Apt.

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, we additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records by the fifth business day after your receipt of this e-mail today. If there will be a delay in meeting this request, kindly acknowledge receipt of this request within five business days, pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3] and 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.5(c)(3), and provide an estimate of the specific date by which a final determination on this request will be provided. If a final determination will not be made within 20 business days of your acknowledgment, please provide a written explanation of the reasons for your agency's inability to grant the request within such time period and specify a date certain within a reasonable period of time when this request will be granted in whole or in part, as required by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3] and 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.5(c)(4).\r\n\r\nIf further clarification is needed in order for your agency to locate the requested records, please immediately contact me. In accordance with 18 NYCRR \u00a7 340.3(c), I ask that you and your staff \"make reasonable efforts to assist\" me \"in identifying the records\" being sought, prior to denying this request. See the July 17, 2006 Advisory Opinion FOIL-AO-16073 of the Committee on Open Government of the New York State Department of State [available at: http://www.dos.state.ny.us/coog/ftext/f16073.htm] \r\n\r\nIf any of the requested records are not in your agency's possession or cannot be located after a diligent search, kindly provide me with your certification to that effect in accordance with Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3] and 18 NYCRR \u00a7 340.3(g). If any of the exact requested records are available on your agency's Internet web site, it will be sufficient to provide me with the specific Uniform Resource Locator (URL) where such records can be downloaded in lieu of sending me an electronic or hard copy of the actual document. Thank you for your consideration and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
