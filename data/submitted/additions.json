This includes any complaints that may be under review or pending investigation and have not yet been made public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents should include, but not limited to, the following information:\r\n\r\nDate of the complaint\r\nLocation of the property (including the borough and the street address)\r\nDescription of the alleged issue(s) reported in the complaint\r\nCurrent status of the complaint (i.e., resolved, under review, pending investigation, etc.)\r\nType of action taken by the authorities, if any (i.e., citation, warning, fine, etc.)\r\nAny follow-up actions taken by the authorities, if applicable (i.e., additional inspections, reprimands, etc.)\r\nTo protect the privacy of individuals involved, I request that any sensitive information regarding the complainant be redacted from the provided documents. However, I do not wish for any other information to be withheld, deleted, or redacted.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Freedom of Information Act provides the public with the right to access information held by government agencies. To support my request, I would like to cite several court cases that have recognized this right, including New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), and County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 710 N.Y.S.2d 846 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000).\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if you could provide me with the requested information in a digital format, such as a CSV or Excel spreadsheet, sent via email or a secure file sharing platform.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
