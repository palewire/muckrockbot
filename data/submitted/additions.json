(\"CPRA\u201d), and all other applicable laws, please disclose the following records.\r\n\r\nAny and all autopsy, death investigation, and coroner\u2019s reports relating to the deaths of the following individuals:\r\n\r\n- Name: Isaiah Sept, Date of birth: 10-07-1973, Date of death: 02-03-2006\r\n\r\n- Name: James Prinz, Date of birth: 10-17-1969, Date of death: 08-20-2017\r\n\r\n- Name: Pete Coonce, Date of birth: 05-31-1998, Date of death: 11-14-2020\r\n\r\n- Name: Lathina Decosta, Date of birth: 08-03-1993, Date of death: 11-14-2020\r\n\r\n- Name: David Mandeville, Date of birth: 01-31-1991, Date of death: 06-06-2021\r\n\r\n- Name: Jordan Young, Date of birth: 01-12-1982, Date of death: 09-28-2022\r\n\r\nIf records pursuant to this request are possessed in machine-readable format such as an .xls, .csv spreadsheet file, please provide the record in this format. Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at abauman@openvallejo.org, or by phone at (707) 561-2108. Thank you for your assistance. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDillon Bergin",
