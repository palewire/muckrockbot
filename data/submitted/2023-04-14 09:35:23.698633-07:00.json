Each Call Sheet includes a list of Fire Department employees at the time of the call, member certifications, what members responded to the call, the response role of each member, the staffing of each apparatus that responded, and the total members that responded to the call. The back side of the call sheet may also include a brief handwritten 1-2 sentence description of the call and the actions taken by the Fire Department. Each Call Sheet has a corresponding Dispatch Times sheet provided by Derry Fire Alarm showing the details of the call (address, determinant level for EMS calls, units responding, and the times of each unit responding). It is believed that these records are located at the Chester Fire Department and are believed to be contained within 3-ring binders with each Dispatch Times Sheet stored together with the corresponding Call Sheet.\r\n\r\nThis request does NOT include official incident reports created by the Chester Fire Department and submitted to NFIRS.  \r\n\r\nPARTICIPATION REPORTS\r\nChester Fire Department participation reports from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2023 (including the quarterly report JAN-2023 through MAR-2023). These reports are kept in Office Manager Ingalls office on the wall immediately to the left of the door. These reports list the call, training, and combined participation percentages of every member on a monthly and quarterly basis. These reports show the participation of employees acting in their official capacities as municipal employees and provide insight into the efficiency/effectiveness of the Department and inform the public of the staffing level regularly available for emergency calls.\r\n\r\nTRUCK CHECK SHEETS\r\nTruck Check sheets for all apparatus (Rescue 1, Engine 1, Engine 2, Tank 1, Utility 1, Forestry 1, Forestry 2, and Car 1) from January 1, 2023 through April 1, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. The purpose of this request is to obtain the data necessary to generate statistics in aggregate concerning the staffing/certification level over a period of time and the availability of resources for emergencies. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin J Dolan",

Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Nebraska Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Nebraska Public Records Act, I hear by request the following records: \r\n\r\nCopies of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and other coordination, cooperation, or other resource or information sharing arrangements with federal, state or local agencies, specifically including but not limited to law enforcement agencies. \r\n\r\nYou may limit the scope of this request to documents generated between August, 2022 and the date of the processing of this request. If the most recent agreements (whether active or inactive) predate August 1, 2022, then I request a copy of the most recently applicable document. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMichael Williams \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMichael Keith Williams \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnebraska-information-analysis-center-9986%252Ffusion-center-mous-moas-and-ndas-144419%252F%253Femail%253DKari.Schmidt%252540nebraska.gov&url_auth_token=AAAfuu_vrtzBJFcGUEYqev8MCRo%3A1pmA0W%3A1VuR7PeMzwkzI-UBrtKgzGGdmbkp9spZXlShhFO4YJk\" \r\nBecause of the nature of the record you have requested, the agency is unable to process your request within four business days for the Following reason(s): \r\nThe requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Sections 84-712.01 and 84-712.05. \r\nThe request for records cannot be complied with by the agency within the prescribed time limits without unduly burdening or interfering with the operation of the agency. \r\nThere is a need for consultation which will be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of the agency having a substantial interest in the determination or in the request subject matter. \r\n \r\n \r\n*The earliest practicable date for responding to and/or fulfilling\u00a0this request will be\u00a0May 17, 2023 . This is just an estimated time,\u00a0most of the time they are answered or received before this date. You have the opportunity to modify or prioritize the request by resubmitting your request indicating how you wish to modify the same. \r\nThe Nebraska State Patrol makes every effort to respond to public record requests as quickly as possible, but some requests are not able to be produced within the statutory time frame. Therefore, the Nebraska State Patrol is seeking additional time as allowed by law. Your patience is appreciated as your request is processed. \r\nSincerely, \r\nKari Schmidt \r\nParalegal 1 \r\nNSP Legal",
