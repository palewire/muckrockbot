Instructions are attached and  located here https://legacyhelp.fsc.follett.com/content/t_generate_title_copy_list_report.htm. Please include all titles (regardless of status) and include the categories and circulation statistics. \r\n\r\nPlease output the file(s) as Excel.\r\n\r\nIn the event the report is limited by the 10,000 title limit, please split it the catalogue information into multiple groupings as the report allows. For instance you could limit the titles in each file by selecting groupings A-G and H-Z.\r\n\r\nAs censorship is at an all time high, we are conducting research on titles that may be most at risk of censorship across Texas. We hope to assist schools in their mission of maintaining young learners critical access to books in their libraries.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSidney Braveword",

The records you seek require a search in at least one other office within ATF, and so your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Your request has been placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing.  A tracking number has been assigned to your request and is set forth above.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request.Because this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of your request, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees.If you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390 to discuss any aspect of your request.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of correspondence and memorandums issued or received by Colonel Raymond Starrett Sleeper (September 13, 1914 \u2013 April 14, 1995; SSN 001-14-5228) between the years of 1965 and 1969 and involving, mentioning, or relating to Project Blue Book. As an example, I am listing below three such records that have been identified previously as being in the possession of the Air Force Historical Research Agency (please see: \"The Controversy Over Unidentified Flying Objects in America: 1896-1973\" by David Jacobs, 1973). However, if further records exist, I am requesting those as well.\r\n\r\nIf it aids in your search, Col. Sleeper served as commander of the Air Force's Foreign Technology Division between August 1966 and November 1968 and as the Deputy Chief of Staff prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe previously identified records are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Memorandum from Colonel Raymond S. Sleeper to Foreign Technology Division, \"Scientific Panel Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects,\" June 2, 1966;\r\n\r\n2. Correspondence from Colonel Raymond S. Sleeper to General William C. Garland, July 28, 1967;\r\n\r\n3. Correspondence General William C. Garland to Colonel Raymond S. Sleeper, August 2, 1967.\r\n\r\nI will not accept clearly releasable records.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Col. Sleeper's privacy, as he passed away on April 14, 1995. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I am attaching a reproduction of Col. Sleeper's grave site. For clarity's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/149575947/raymond-starrett-sleeper\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to planning and policy implementation of the Air Force's Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book was a study of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) conducted by the Air Force between 1952 and 1969. It has been a subject of recurring public interest since its inception, with no less than a dozen books written about it over the last 50 years. Recently, the subject of UAP has reentered the public consciousness, in light of a series of articles in publications like the New York Times, Congressional hearings, and the creation of a government agency known as the All-Domain Anomalous Resolution Office. Any Project Blue Book records still held by the Air Force would clarify how prior investigations into this subject were handled.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
