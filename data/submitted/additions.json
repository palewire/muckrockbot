You will notice it does not contain many of the fields you requested.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis Stat \u00a719.35(1)(L) an authority is not required to create a new record by extracting information from existing records and compiling the information in a new format. The records you are requesting are not a record.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\n\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",
