If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Dear Beth Hundsdorfer, The Madison County, IL received a public information request from you on January 18, 2023. Your request mentioned: \u201cAll reports, video recordings, audio records, lab results, evidence looks, search warrant applications and returns, 911 calls and CAD reports and any other documents possessed by your agency related to the murder of Randy Gori on Jan . 4, 2020. \nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\u201d The amount of information requested is \"unduly burdensome\" for the public body. Before declining to comply with a request as unduly burdensome, the public body must extend to the requester an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable proportions. If a public body determines that the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in obtaining the information, and that there is no way to narrow the request, it must notify the requester in writing, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance would so burden the operations of the public body. Such a response is treated as a denial of the FOIA request. See 5 ILCS 140/3(g).\u00a0\u00a0As such the Madison County Sheriff's Office is attempting to determine the extent and information that is present in the case and being\u00a0requested.\u00a0 Under\u00a0section 3(e) of FOIA provides that the period for response may be extended by the public body The time for response may be extended if: (ii) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; The Madison County, IL has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.\u00a0 Your request is granted in part and denied in part.\u00a0 These files were found to be redacted and released with the following exemptions: 7(1)(a) \u2013 In that the request relates to records prohibited from release by Federal or State law (i.e. Juvenile Arrest Records) 7(1)(b) \u2013 Private Information such as SSN, Phone Number(s), Addresses, DL numbers are protected from release 7(1)(c) \u2013 Releasing the records constitutes an unreasonable Invasion of Personal Privacy of those involved. DOB\u2019s and family matters in which personal privacy outweighs the public interest are exempt. \"personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\u00a0 Section 7(1)(c) defines an \"[u]nwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" as \"the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\" 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (West 2018) In determining whether or not the disclosure of personal information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the public\u2019s interest in disclosure must be balanced against the degree of invasion of privacy. FOIA contemplates a case-by-case analysis that is necessarily based upon the specific facts underlying a request for disclosure. A few examples of the types of information that have been approved by the Public Access Counselor for redaction under 7(1) (c) include: dates of birth; names and identifying information of victims in police reports; and graphic photos of the deceased\u2019s body in an autopsy report. FOIA exempts from disclosure personal information\u00a0contained in public records if disclosing that information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u00a0for the person or persons to whom the information pertains. \"Personal information\" has been defined by the courts as information \"that is private and confidential.\"\u00a0Chicago Tribune v.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all non-exempt, classified individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, title, department or agency, full-time/part-time status, work zip code, original hire date, civil service status, and gross annual salary (i.e., the base hourly wage for each hourly employee and the base annual salary for salaried employees for each of the time periods in question). If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022. For each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary.\u201d  We\u2019ve now had time to review your request in detail and have determined that we require more specific information from you before we can begin to gather any responsive documents.\r\n\r\nThe information you have requested is below:\r\n\u00b7  State Employee\u2019s Full Name (first, middle, last, suffix)\r\n\u00b7  Unique employee identification code\r\n\u00b7  Agency/Department\r\n\u00b7  Position/Job Title\r\n\u00b7  Race\r\n\u00b7  Gender\r\n\u00b7  Full-time/Part-time status\r\n\u00b7  Location\r\n\u00b7  Hire date\r\n\u00b7  Termination date\r\n\u00b7  Civil service status\r\n\u00b7  Gross annual salary\r\nYou noted that you would like data pulled for each month, would that be for the first of each month requested? Meaning you would like data for Jan. 1, 2019, Feb. 1, 2019, March 1, 2019\u2026etc. through May 1, 2022 or June 1, 2022? You also asked for data for the following offices: offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments. Could you be more specific about which agencies or departments for which you would like information? If you would like all enterprise data, that would include the Governor\u2019s office and state agencies, we do not have a lieutenant governor. If you would like boards and commissions, we could include that. Also, below you note hire date and termination date, if you are looking for current employees we will only have hire dates and not termination dates. When you say civil service status, what do you mean, specifically?\r\nWe may not have complete information regarding some of the above fields. We will know more once we begin our search.\r\nAfter you\u2019ve refined your request, we will provide you with an estimated cost, which will include the cost of staff to research and locate the records, as well as the cost to copy, compile, and legally review and redact the records of any confidential material. Once you\u2019ve paid this estimated cost, we will begin the process of searching for and compiling the records to provide you with any non-exempt, responsive documents.\r\nAttached please find our public records policy, which further describes our costs and process (https://www.oregon.gov/das/Policies/107-001-030.pdf).\r\nThank you,\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D87B44.34123270]\r\nAndrea Chiapella\r\nCommunications Director\r\nDepartment of Administrative Services<https://www.oregon.gov/das/>\n971-345-1333\r\nPronouns: she, her, hers",

If Oregon does not have a program like that or if the data is unavailable, please exclude it. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other clarification questions. \r\n\r\nBen",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Of the officers in item (1) above, shift length/times of every shift the officer has worked within the department regardless of assignment.

For each officer in item (1), all use-of-force reports and complaints filed by/against each officer.\r\n\r\n4. All student arrests  made by SRO officers from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Information should include student race/age/sex, date of occurrence, and SRO badge number. \r\n\r\nPlease provide me with these public records in a machine-readable ASCII format, such as a CSV, SQL, TXT, or similar raw file. CSV or SQL files are preferred when available. Please email the responsive records to my email address: michaeltopper@ucsb.edu.\r\n\r\nIf email transmission is not feasible, I agree to prepay the actual cost of the storage medium on which the responsive records are transmitted, any postage costs incurred.

        "communication": "Good morning, Mr. Boguslaw, \r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your FOIA request; I am the analyst assigned.\u00a0 We have initiated a request for a search of the records you are seeking and expect an answer soon.\u00a0 In the meantime, should you have any questions or concerns, please be sure to let me know.\u00a0 This communication also addresses your requests for a fee waiver and expedited processing. \r\nBefore making a decision for fee waivers, we must first determine whether your request meets the Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for fee waivers, taking into consideration the following factors:  \r\n  * Does the record specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the Government (specifically, the United States Marine Corps)?  \r\n  * If so, is disclosure likely to contribute to public understanding of these operations and activities? Are the releasable contents of the record(s) meaningfully informative in relation to the subject of the request?  \r\n  * Is the focus on contributing to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government rather than the requester\u2019s own understanding or that of a narrow segment of interested persons?  \r\n  * Will any likely contribution to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government be significant? \r\nRequests for fee waivers should address these requirements in sufficient detail for us to make an informed decision, as each request is considered on its own merits.\u00a0 After a thorough review, it was determined that your request does not meet these requirements and we have, therefore, denied it.\u00a0 Since we have categorized you as \u201cmedia\u201d and records, if any, would be sent electronically, we do not anticipate any associated FOIA processing fees. \r\nAs regards your request for expedited processing, before approving such a request, we would have to determine that there was a compelling need for the information, and it is the requester\u2019s burden to demonstrate this.\u00a0 \"Compelling need\" can mean either that (1) failure to obtain the records could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to an individual's life or safety, or (2) the information is \"urgently needed\" and its value will be lost if not disseminated quickly.\u00a0 The basis you provided does not demonstrate the kind of compelling need required for us to place your request ahead of all the others that are pending.\u00a0 We must, therefore, deny your request for expedited processing. \r\nIf you consider the above adverse determinations, you may appeal within FOIAonline.\u00a0 If you prefer, you may write to the Department of the Navy, Judge Advocate General (Code 14), 1322 Patterson Avenue SE, Suite 3000, Washington Navy Yard, DC\u00a0 20374-5066.\u00a0 Your appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 calendar days from the date of this correspondence and should include a statement indicating why you believe it should be granted.\u00a0 I recommend that your letter and its envelope both bear the notation, \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d. \r\nYou also have the right to seek assistance and/or dispute resolution services from the Department of the Navy FOIA Public Liaison, Mr. Christopher Julka, at Christopher.a.julka@navy.mil or (703) 697-0031.\u00a0 You may also contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) for assistance and/or dispute resolution at ogis@nara.gov or (877) 684-6448.\u00a0 For more information online about services provided by OGIS, please visit their website at www.archives.gov/ogis/. (http://www.archives.gov/ogis/) \r\nAs the analyst assigned, if you should have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 703-614-4008 or hqmcfoia@usmc.mil. \r\nMichael Peters \r\nDeputy, FOIA/PA Programs",

I would also like to request expedited review of this request under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(iii), (iv) which compels expedited processing for a \"matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" In this case, my reporting has detailed that Conor Lamb, a candidate for The United States Senate in Pennsylvania, may have had conflicts of interest while adjudicating cases as a military prosecutor. The public then has an urgent need for media coverage of these matters before heading to the polls to vote in the 2022 Pennsylvania primary election. \r\n\r\nAs a member of the news media writing for publications including The Nation, The New Republic, and the Intercept I request that all associated fees be waived. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The request does not duplicate a major category of records, and does not seek \"all records containing particular words\" or \"every report filed with the public office for a particular time period\". My request asked for only specific reports during a specific time span, and only for records that were pertaining to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nSince you disagreed as to the narrowness of that request, allow me to modify the request to be even more specific and provide additional information to help you ascertain which records are responsive:\r\n\r\nA copy of any PDF, Word Document, InDesign Document, and/or email, received by COTA's Office of the President, which was originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard, received in the years 2020 or 2021, containing or about a particular report, hereinafter referred to as \"the report\". The report is the final report in a study which was commissioned by COTA, which explored various ways to fund the portion of COTA's budget which is currently sourced from passenger fares, in the event that COTA decided to make passenger fares free. The report was commissioned about three years ago (2018-2020) and completed about a year later (2020-2021). The study and report were paid for in part using COTA funds. The report may be referred to as \"the Ice Miller report\" in casual usage. I am interested in the final report document, in whatever format it was provided in.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know whether you require additional detail to identify this report.",

        "communication": "Hi Nicole,\r\n\r\nI disagree with your characterization of my request as \"ambiguous and overly broad\" as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"all records containing particular words\" - This request is for a specific report with an identified subject matter, not \"all records\" containing particular words.  \r\n2. \"duplication for all records having to do with a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report pertaining to a particular topic, not all records pertaining to that topic.  \r\n3. \"all records of a particular type\" - This request is for a specific report in whatever format it may be in, not all records of a particular type or format.  \r\n4. \"all emails sent or received by a particular email address with no subject matter or time limitation\" - This request is for a specific report. In the event that that report may have been transmitted by email, the email is identified with subject matter and time limitations.  \r\n5. \"all documents which document any and all instances of a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report, with certain identifying characteristics noted in the request. This is not a request for all documents which discuss this report's topic.  \r\n6. \"discovery-style requests that seek all records relating to or reflecting certain types of information\" - This request is limited by date range, the name of the report's author, the report's subject matter, and the type of document containing the report. This is a request for a specific report. It is not a discovery-style request.   \r\n\r\nBelow, I have rephrased my request in order to make it clearer which records I am requesting. I have also included additional information about the requested record, which further narrows the scope of the request.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of a report in COTA's possession. The report has all of the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Prepared by Ice Miller or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n2. Originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n3. Received by COTA in December 2022 or in January 2021\r\n4. Titled \"Fare-Free Transit Analysis\" or with similar words\r\n5. With a subject matter of free public transportation or fare-free transit\r\n6. Commissioned by COTA, and paid for in some part using COTA funds\r\n\r\nThe following details are provided to help you in your search, but the requested document may not meet all or any of these characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. The report may have been attached to an email from Michael.Coleman@icemiller.com or from an @icemiller.com email address\r\n2. The email or report may be dated December 4, 2020, or later\r\n3. The email or report may mention Robert Miller, a past COTA Board member\r\n4. The report may have been included in an email sent to Joanna Pinkerton, to PinkertonJM@cota.com, to another COTA employee in the COTA Office of the President at that time, to Terry Foegler, and/or to Sophia Mohr\r\n\r\nIn the event that multiple versions of the report are discovered, I request the final version of the report. In the event that the report is available in multiple formats, I request the digital version of the PDF, Word Document, or other original document(s) sent to COTA. In the event that the report is split across multiple files or documents (such as a cover letter, a slide deck, and appendices), I request those documents which are necessary to compile the complete report. In the event that the report was submitted by electronic mail to COTA, I also request a copy of the email that was used to send the files comprising the report, in addition to the report files themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this information is still insufficient to identify the responsive records, then pursuant to ORC 149.43(B)(2) I request a copy of COTA's document retention schedule, and information on the manner in which records are retained by COTA and its Office of the President and accessed in the ordinary course of the office's duties.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBenjamin Keith",

I expect that the complete set of responsive documents includes an appendix or attachment containing the references for these annotations. Please check again to make sure that you have located all responsive documents.\r\n\r\nThe report's cover letter opens with the preface, \"Via Electronic Mail\". I requested \"a copy of the email that was used to send the files comprising the report, in addition to the report files themselves.\" Since you have successfully located the report, which was sent by email, you must have identified and located the email that contained the report.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request.

Your request mentioned: \u201cDear Custodian of Records: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed.

Your request mentioned: \"Dear Custodian of Records: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDave Maass \r\nDirector of Investigations \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpalo-alto-police-department-404%252Fautomated-license-plate-readers-palo-alto-police-department-136420%252F%253Femail%253Ddacia.tavares%252540cityofpaloalto.org&url_auth_token=AAAdGkZVM5s1T3Gc4G57-xbCdMY%3A1ortS4%3AgHKh4E4foinAaXh68CNpcTt4Xggy-34nZkyxeyQXhAw\u201d \r\nThe Palo Alto Police Department has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files relating to or mentioning Paul X. Kelley.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request has been forwarded to appropriate campus offices and a\r\nsearch for responsive documents is currently underway. Records identified\r\nas responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your\r\naccess, in accordance with relevant law and University policy.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is no central repository for all University records.\r\nThe identification and collection of potentially responsive records is only\r\nthe first step in the CPRA response process. The collected records must be\r\nreviewed by this office to ensure that they are in fact responsive to your\r\nrequest and to assess whether any legal privileges or exemptions from\r\ndisclosure are applicable and whether redactions may be required to protect\r\nindividuals\u2019 rights to privacy. Please also bear in mind that we are\r\nconcurrently fulfilling numerous other requests, many of which were\r\nreceived before yours and that we generally process requests in the order\r\nin which they are received. The current timeframe for fulfillment of most\r\nrequests is ten weeks, although this may vary due to the nature and\r\ncomplexity of the request.\r\n\r\nAlthough the requested records have not yet been fully identified, based on\r\nthe terms of the request, we have made a preliminary determination that the\r\nrequest likely does seek disclosable records within the possession of the\r\nUniversity. This office will provide you with a status update after the\r\nrequested records have been thoroughly reviewed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that CPRA allows agencies to make records available \u201cupon\r\npayment of fees covering direct costs of duplication.\u201d Government Code\r\nsection 7922.530(a).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nLiane Wong\r\nPublic Records Coordinator\r\n************************************\r\nPublic Records Office\r\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: <138394-99879493@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nDate: Mon, Jan 2, 2023 at 6:39 PM\r\nSubject: California Public Records Act Request: UC Berkeley FTX (University\r\nof California, Berkeley)\r\nTo: <lianewong@berkeley.edu>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\r\nPRA Office\r\nMC #1500\r\n200 California Hall\r\nBerkeley, CA 94720-1500\r\n\r\nJanuary 2, 2023\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the\r\nfollowing records:\r\n\r\n*All email communications regarding FTX and stadium naming rights between\r\nJanuary 1, 2020 and present day.\r\n*The contract between FTX and UC Berkeley for the stadium naming rights.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/17/uc-berkeley-suspends-stadium-naming-rights-deal-with-ftx/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform\r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function.

As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied.

        "communication": "Dear Dave Maass, \nThe City of Gilroy, City Clerk\u2019s Office received the below records request from you on January 11, 2023 for records pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Government Code section 6250 et seq. (\u201cPRA\u201d) and the Gilroy Open Government Ordinance (\u201cOGO\u201d). \n \"Dear Custodian of Records:\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \nAmerican Canyon Police Department\nAuburn Police Department\nBakersfield Police Department\nBeaumont Police Department\nBell Gardens Police Department\nBell Police Department\nBelvedere Police Department\nBeverly Hills Police Department\nBrawley Police Department\nBrentwood Police Department\nBuena Park Police Department\nBurbank Police Department\nCarlsbad Police Department\nCathedral City Police Department\nChino Police Department\nChula Vista Police Department\nCitrus Heights Police Department\nClaremont Police Department\nClayton Police Department\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\nCoronado Police Department\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\nCypress Police Department\nEl Segundo Police Department\nFairfield Police Department\nFolsom Police Department\nFontana Police Department\nFresno Police Department\nFullerton Police Department\nGalt Police Department\nGarden Grove Police Department\nGardena Police Department\nGlendale Police Department\nHemet Police Department\nHermosa Beach Police Department\nImperial Police Department\nIrvine Police Department\nLa Habra Police Department\nLa Mesa Police Department\nLa Verne Police Department\nLaguna Beach Police Department\nLivermore Police Department\nLodi Police Department\nLong Beach Police Department\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\nMartinez Police Department\nMerced Police Department\nMill Valley Police Department\nModesto Police Department\nMonterey Park Police Department\nNewport Beach Police Department\nOakley Police Department\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\nOrange Police Department\nPalm Springs Police Department\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\nPasadena Police Department\nPleasant Hill Police Department\nPomona Police Department\nRedlands Police Department\nRedondo Beach Police Department\nRipon Police Department\nRoseville Police Department\nSalinas Police Department\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\nSan Diego Police Department\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\nSausalito Police Department\nSimi Valley Police Department\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\nStockton Police Department\nTiburon Police Department\nTorrance Police Department\nTracy Police Department\nTustin Police Department\nWest Sacramento Police Department\nWestminster Police Department\nWoodland Police Department\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org.

Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, HHS has adjusted its normal operations to balance the need of completing its mission as effectively and efficiently as possible while also adhering to the recommended safety guidelines to protect of our staff.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, HHS has received an unprecedented amount of FOIA request submissions.  Given the incredible volume of FOIA requests received and the limited number FOIA Analysts currently working on processing these requests, the following unusual and exceptional circumstances will impact our response time: (1) we will need to search for and collect records from components and/or field offices external to this office; and (2) because we receive a very heavy volume of FOIA requests, we will process your request in line with our established policy of \"first in, first out\" case processing. This policy is consistent with court decisions regarding FOIA's time limits.\r\n\r\nAs we are only able to receive requests electronically, we are experiencing a delay in receiving initial requests; and as such, a delay in processing requests. While unavoidable, this has inevitably caused response times to fluctuate making it extremely difficult to provide an estimated date of completion. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nCurrently your request is being processed.  The Office for Civil Rights was identified as the records manager and is currently searching for pages responsive to your request. Once records are identified they will be assigned to an analyst, you will then be informed and then may reach out directly to the analyst at that time.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nRuhma Sufian\r\nOS FOIA Division Intake\r\nAssistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA)\r\nOffice of the Secretary (OS)\r\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)",
