I request any and all documents pertaining to DoD involvement with the production of \"Untitled Medger Evers Documentary.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Untitled Medger Evers Documentary,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The case is still in our complex backlog queue, pending assignment to a first level review.  Please be advised that each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made.  Given the volume of our backlog and the fluctuation of queue placement due to consults from other agencies that predate your request, it's likely that your case may not be assigned to a first level review within the next 12 months.  At this time, the estimated completion date is approximately 3-4 years.  \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience thus far.\nRegards,\r\nCindy B \r\nNSA/CSS FOIA Requester Service Center\r\n(301)688-6527",

Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 232 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 659 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 998 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 1360313-0 for FBI records concerning John Francis Good.  The FBI has located approximately 1,782 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

Sorry for my not being informed of the name change.\r\n\r\nWith regards to this FOIA on John Good, one main file and two reference serials were located on this subject.  The main file does consist of 5 sections with approximately 1,777 pages covering Mr. Good's career.  If you do want this request to be processed from the medium track queue with current estimated time for processing at about 7 months, the first two sections can be processed in whole and the 3rd section partial processing up to the 949 threshold for page count.  For this reduced scope, upon completion of all materials (an interim CD release should be received in about 3 to 4 months), you can place another FOIA request, citing this one, and ask for additional materials to be processed from this case.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this.  I do appreciate your consideration and patience.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeslie Wilson",

The question of whether such files can be released has already been decided by your office. This should not require the agency to create a new record. This type of file format is how the logo must have been initially created by or for the government. An appeal decision in a previous FOIA case for the NROL-39 logo concluded that these records are in the public domain and must be released. The appeal case number with the National Reconnaissance Office was F-2019-00113. You can read the decision at https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/nrol-39-mission-logo-78740/#file-817847\r\n\r\nI am requesting the release for all missions listed on the following wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NRO_launches  If you need any clarification or further enumeration, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",

Request that all files be released a vector file format like a high quality PDF, an SVG or EPS.\"\r\n\r\nWe have assigned tracking number F-2023-00005 to your request. We will limit our search to NRO-originated records.\r\n\r\nSince we may be unable to provide a response within the 20 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the right to consider this a denial and may appeal on this basis to the NRO Appellate Authority, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715 after the initial 20 working day period has elapsed; doing so, however, would exhaust your administrative appeal rights. To preserve these rights, we recommend that you allow us sufficient time to continue processing your request and respond as soon as we can.  You will then have the right to appeal any denial of information after you receive a final response from us.  Unless we hear otherwise from you, we will assume that you agree and will continue processing your FOIA requests on this basis.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA authorizes federal agencies to assess fees for record services. Based on the information provided, you have been placed in the \"other\" category of requesters.  Requesters in this category are responsible for the cost of search time exceeding two hours ($48.00/hour) and duplication fees ($.15 per page) exceeding 100 pages. Additional information about fees can be found in the Department of Defense Fees section of the electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-cfr) at https://ecfr.io/title-32/se232.2.286.112.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email FOIA@NRO.mil <mailto:FOIA@NRO.mil>  or call the Requester Service Center at 703-745-0600.\r\n\r\n \r\nV/r, \r\n\r\nNational Reconnaissance Office\r\nInformation Review and Release Group\n",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 72-HQ-2190.  The FBI located approximately 1,374 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 57 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\n",

We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nFrom: FBI.FOIPA.NEGOTIATION\r\nSent: Monday, August 3, 2020 10:58 AM\r\nTo: 91016-87663711@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:91016-87663711@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSubject: FOIPA # 1463943-000\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 74-WF-293.  The FBI located approximately 1,100 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 8 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 29 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 56 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As of October 1, 2023, we have 373 open requests and over 1,407,542 pages of records waiting to be reviewed, analyzed, redacted, and released. As such, our office must balance the competing needs of many requesters. Some request small numbers of records that are easy to review and analyze. Others request large numbers of records or records that are complex and require a longer time to review.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of fairness, we make every effort to respond to requests in the order received. Therefore, we will proceed in processing your requests in the same manner, responding to the oldest before moving on to your next subsequent request. However as a one-time exception, if you would like to re-prioritize your requests, please email our office by October 20, 2023. If we do not hear from you by that date, our office will continue processing your requests in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact our office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Adams\r\nCompliance Analyst\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\r\nOffice of Public Records and Open Public Meetings\r\nMail: Roosevelt Commons-Box 354997, Seattle, WA 98195\r\nStreet: 4311 11th Ave NE, #360\n",

It is a straightforward request, and I've made an effort to craft it in such a way that minimizes the University's burden in responding, by explicitly excluding records likely to require third party notification efforts.  I'm requesting information that the University has already specifically identified on the CoMotion FAQ, which should not take two calendar years to locate.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKevin Wallace",

These costs are allowed by RCW 42.56.070(7)(a).\r\n\r\nPlease remit payment by check or money order, or call to make an appointment to view these records, by 06/03/2024. There is no cost to view the records in the office. Alternatively, as indicated in previous correspondence, we are piloting an online portal. If you would prefer to receive the records through that medium, please contact us before 06/03/2024 so that we can re-calculate the invoice amount. The costs for obtaining records via the portal are on our website.  If we do not receive payment or a call for an appointment by 06/03/2024, we will close your request.\r\n\r\nYou may reach us by email at pubrec@uw.edu or you may call us at 206.543.9180.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTisa Escobar\r\nUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\r\nOffice of Public Records and Open Public Meetings\r\nMail: Roosevelt Commons-Box 354997, Seattle, WA 98195\r\nStreet: 4311 11th Ave NE, #360\n",

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.

Electronic records must not be printed and scanned as that does not constitute a \"copy\" (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098). You must justify every withholding of any information in writing.  You must provide footnotes or other clear references to justify each and every redaction (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098).  If you do not provide correct copies of electronic records or do not justify by footnote or other clear reference each and every redaction, we will ask SOTF to again file official misconduct charges against Chief Scott before the Ethics Commission, as we did in SOTF 19112, pursuant to SFAC 67.34.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a publicly- viewable mailbox. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

If you still feel you are unable to complete this Request, please request an Attorney General Opinion as required by law. Below is the statue for reference along with the requirements for withholding information.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n-B\r\n\r\nA. \r\nDuties of the Governmental Body and of the Attorney General Under \r\nSubchapter G \r\nSections 552.301, 552.302, and 552.303 of the Government Code set out the duty of a \r\ngovernmental body to seek the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether information is excepted \r\nfrom disclosure to the public. \r\nSection 552.301, subsections (a) and (b), provides that when a governmental body receives a \r\nwritten request for information the governmental body wishes to withhold, it must seek an attorney \r\ngeneral decision within ten business days of its receipt of the request and state the exceptions to \r\ndisclosure that it believes are applicable.  Subsections (a) and (b) read: \r\n(a) A governmental body that receives a written request for information that it wishes \r\nto withhold from public disclosure and that it considers to be within one of the \r\nexceptions under Subchapter C must ask for a decision from the attorney general \r\nabout whether the information is within that exception if there has not been a \r\nprevious determination about whether the information falls within one of the \r\nexceptions. \r\n. . . \r\n(b) The governmental body must ask for the attorney general\u2019s decision and state the \r\nexceptions that apply within a reasonable time but not later than the 10th business \r\nday after the date of receiving the written request. \r\nThus, a governmental body that wishes to withhold information from the public on the ground of \r\nan exception generally must seek the decision of the attorney general as to the applicability of that \r\nexception.144  In addition, an entity contending that it is not subject to the Act may timely request \r\na decision from the attorney general to avoid the consequences of noncompliance if the entity is \r\ndetermined to be subject to the Act.145  Therefore, when requesting such a decision, the entity \r\n\r\nshould not only present its arguments as to why it is not subject to the Act, but should also raise \r\nany exceptions to required disclosure it believes apply to the requested information. \r\nA governmental body need not request an attorney general decision if there has been a previous \r\ndetermination that the requested material falls within one of the exceptions to disclosure.146  What \r\nconstitutes a \u201cprevious determination\u201d is narrow in scope, and governmental bodies are cautioned \r\nagainst treating most published attorney general decisions as \u201cprevious determinations\u201d to avoid \r\nthe requirements of section 552.301(a).  The attorney general has determined that there are two \r\ntypes of previous determinations.147  The first and by far the most common instance of a previous \r\ndetermination pertains to specific information that is again requested from a governmental body \r\nwhen the attorney general has previously issued a decision that evaluates the public availability of \r\nthe precise information or records at issue.  This first instance of a previous determination does \r\nnot apply to records that are substantially similar to records previously submitted to the attorney \r\ngeneral for review, nor does it apply to information that may fall within the same category as any \r\ngiven records on which the attorney general has previously ruled.  The first type of previous \r\ndetermination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue is precisely the same information that was previously submitted to \r\nthe attorney general pursuant to section 552.301(e)(1)(D) of the Government Code; \r\n2. the governmental body that received the request for the information is the same \r\ngovernmental body that previously requested and received a ruling from the attorney \r\ngeneral; \r\n3. the attorney general\u2019s prior ruling concluded the precise information is or is not excepted \r\nfrom disclosure under the Act; and \r\n4. the law, facts, and circumstances on which the prior attorney general ruling was based have \r\nnot changed since the issuance of the ruling.148 \r\nAbsent all four of the above criteria, and unless the second type of previous determination applies, \r\na governmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nfrom the public information that is requested under the Act. \r\nThe second type of previous determination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue falls within a specific, clearly delineated category of information \r\nabout which the attorney general has previously rendered a decision;\r\n2. the previous decision is applicable to the particular governmental body or type of \r\ngovernmental body from which the information is requested;149 \r\n3. the previous decision concludes the specific, clearly delineated category of information is \r\nor is not excepted from disclosure under the Act; \r\n4. the elements of law, fact, and circumstances are met to support the previous decision\u2019s \r\nconclusion that the requested records or information at issue is or is not excepted from \r\nrequired disclosure; and150 \r\n5. the previous decision explicitly provides that the governmental body or bodies to which \r\nthe decision applies may withhold the information without the necessity of again seeking \r\na decision from the attorney general. \r\nAbsent all five of the above criteria, and unless the first type of previous determination applies, a \r\ngovernmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nrequested information from the public under the Act.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n(b)  Information in appraisal records under Section 25.02 is confidential and is available only for the official use of the appraisal district, this state, the comptroller, and taxing units and political subdivisions of this state if:\r\n(1)  the information identifies the home address of a named individual to whom this section applies; and\r\n(2)  the individual:\r\n\r\n(A)  chooses to restrict public access to the information on the form prescribed for that purpose by the comptroller under Section 5.07; or\r\n\r\n(B)  is a federal or state judge, or the spouse of a federal or state judge, beginning on the date the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System notifies the appraisal district of the judge's qualification for the judge's office.\r\n(c)  A choice made under Subsection (b) remains valid until rescinded in writing by the individual.\r\n(d)  This section does not prohibit the public disclosure of information in appraisal records that identifies property according to an address if the information does not identify an individual who has made an election under Subsection (b) in connection with the individual's address.\r\n",

This obligation is supported by case law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tNational Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense (2004):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case establishes the principle that agencies must conduct comprehensive searches and cannot rely on overly broad or restrictive interpretations of FOIA exemptions.\r\n\t\u2022\tDow Jones & Co. v. Department of Justice (1986):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case underscores the obligation of agencies to make a good-faith effort to search for responsive records and provides guidance on the scope of such searches.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these legal precedents, I request that the ATF take all necessary measures to ensure a thorough and diligent search for the requested records. Any failure to do so would constitute a violation of FOIA obligations.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease adhere to your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted, and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your thorough attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Accordingly, your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request by ten additional days, as permitted by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. \r\n\r\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  Your request was assigned to the Complex track.  It was placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing.  Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-00467.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request. \r\n\r\nBecause this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of FOIA requests at this time, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nGinae E.

I appreciate the update, though it seems like we might be in for a bit of a wait.\r\n\r\nI understand these things can take time, but it does feel a bit like we're experiencing the kind of thoroughness one might expect from an especially zealous agency visit.\r\n\r\nI will certainly follow up again at a later date for a status check. In the meantime, I hope your weekend is as smooth and uneventful as possible.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "06/28/2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREFER TO:  2024-00467 \n\nJordan  Lassiter \nMuckRock News, DEPT MR156303 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, Massachusetts  02115 \n\nDear Mr. Lassiter: \n\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated 12/23/2023, and received by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on the same date, in which you requested records concerning Ghost Guns. Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-00467.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we processed a total of 722 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nYou requested material ATF is required to maintain pursuant to the Gun Control Act (GCA) and/or is information contained in ATF Firearms Trace System database.  This information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Exemption 3 of the FOIA and Public Law 112-55, 125 Stat. 552. \nExemption 3 of the FOIA permits the withholding of information prohibited from disclosure by another statute only if one of two disjunctive requirements are met:  the statute either (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.  Thus, a statute falls within the exemption\u2019s coverage if it satisfies any one of its disjunctive requirements. \nBeginning in 2003, Congress placed restrictions on ATF\u2019s disclosure of certain GCA related information.  In short, ATF can only provide certain GCA data to a law enforcement agency or a prosecutor solely in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2006, Congress included a provision within each iteration of the restriction, which effectively made the law permanent. \nThe most recent iteration of these various restrictions was included in ATF\u2019s 2012 Appropriation Bill, Public Law 112-55, 125 Stat. 552.  Some of the information in the requested records falls within this restriction.  Because the Fiscal Year 2006 through 2008 restrictions satisfy all the requirements of FOIA Exemption 3, and the 2012 language is perpetuated from those restrictions, I am withholding this information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section 552 (b)(3) and Public Law 112-55, 125 Stat. 552. \n\nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees, under FOIA Exemption 6.  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the person whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). \n\nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees, pursuant to Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA.  Exemption 7(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C).  The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.  The public interest under Exemption 7(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party.  In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA but would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \n\nWe are withholding specific law enforcement codes, techniques, and procedures used in our investigation pursuant to Exemption 7(E) of the FOIA.  Exemption 7(E) exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records or information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E).  The information withheld reveals various law enforcement file numbers and codes which are primarily used to store and retrieve law enforcement information.  The information withheld also reveals specific law enforcement procedures and techniques used in this investigation.  Disclosure of this information could enable individuals outside of the agency to circumvent agency functions and gain access to sensitive investigative information. \n\nWe are interpreting the \u201cinvestigations\u201d portion of your request as a request for information on a third party.  Disclosure of records relating to a third party is only permitted with the express authorization and written consent of the third party, proof of death of the third party, or a demonstration that the public interest in the disclosure outweighs the personal privacy interest of the third party.  Since you have not provided any documentation that would demonstrate your right to access the records of a third party, we cannot disclose the requested information at this time.  Such a disclosure would constitute a violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a and the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). \n\nIf you can obtain consent or provide proof of death, ATF may be able to release responsive documents should they exist.  In order to disclose information to you, you will need to have the individual verify his/her identity as required by Department regulation 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.41(d).  Specifically, if you would like this office to process your request and search for responsive records in this office, the individual will need to either (1) return a completed Form DOJ-361, Certification of Identity, to this office, or (2) provide a statement notarized or under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, indicating the individual\u2019s full name, place of birth, date of birth, and current address. \n\nPlease return either the Form DOJ-361 or the individual\u2019s notarized statement, along with your request, to the Information and Privacy Governance Division. \n\nWe are also withholding investigative information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A) because it concerns an ongoing investigation.  Exemption (b)(7)(A) authorizes us to withhold investigatory records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nA search of the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 1 page that is responsive to your request.  ICE has determined that 1 page will be released in their entirety; ICE has claimed no deletions or exemptions. All PREA audit reports are posted to the public ICE FOIA Library. Please review these reports at www.ice.gov/foia/library. \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

        "communication": "Dear Julieta Cardenas:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on May 23, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA. Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201cnews media\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nOnce we initiate processing, a search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case Number, 2024-OSEC-04821-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Olga Colacicco by email at olga.colacicco@usda.gov<mailto:olga.colacicco@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov%20>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients. Any unauthorized interception of this message or the use or disclosure of the information it contains may violate the law and subject the violator to civil or criminal penalties.

The grounds for appeal are as follows:\r\n\r\n(b)(1): All records returned are older than the 25 years. Related redactions should be reconsidered in light of automatic declassification policies per Executive Order 13526.  \r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C): By context, I believe names of persons that have been redacted for reasons of privacy are in fact known to be deceased. Such deceased persons have diminished privacy interests, which are outweighed by the public interest in disclosure.  \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is for the request to be remanded with instructions for the following:\r\n\r\n1) To review classified records with the presumption that records older than 25 years are declassified by default. \r\n\r\n2) To review the records, cross referencing names against the RIDS Dead List; where an individual named is in fact known to be deceased, redaction should be removed. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nT.

Proof of death is not required as her death was widely reported: https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/30/ellen-tauscher-dead-at-67-1293104.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

Please log in to the CORA Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records. We found the check. CORA Records Request - R000453-060324  NOTE: Denver Public Schools uses the Facebook moderator to block certain keywords. Keywords that might be inappropriate\u00a0or discriminatory for example. All hidden comments are reviewed\u00a0by the DPS social media team\u00a0and often unhidden because the Facebook Moderator might have blocked it for an odd reason. A key example of this is a comment that says, \"Happy Pride Month!\" This comment was blocked because it has an exclamation point then unblocked by a human on the DPS social media team. Again, all hidden comments are reviewed\u00a0by a DPS employee. \r\nAn oversight of the words that are blocked on the Facebook Moderator is the exclamation sign. Therefore any post that has \"!\" would have been hidden by the Facebook Moderator, then unhidden by the DPS social media team. This has since been changed. \r\nAlso of note, comments blocked by the\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Moderator, then unhidden by a DPS employee, did not show up on this report. \r\nDPS operates with a social media policy that does not allow for bullying, use of slurs, use of profanity, or words and comments that violate our values. \r\nSincerely, STACY WHEELER \r\nCORA Officer",

Your request is made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska Public Records Act. In your request dated April 29, 2024 you sought information related to date of stop, time of stop, race of driver, gender of driver, age of driver, if search occurred, if contraband was found, anonymized officer ID, and stop location for all years available. This is the response required by NEB. REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712, et seq. The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute does not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. I have attached the available data we were able to pull from our database to the portal attachment tab for your refereence. There are random blanks for race, gender, and location in the data. All fields are supposed to be filled out, however, based on my experience with drop down boxes on our cruiser computers, the occassional clerical error can occur as the information doesn't always populate from the drop down menu. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this. Section 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is responsible for denying a portion of your request. Thank you for your patience in my response to this request. If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.5259.",

The NamUs case file number for this person is 4326. According to the NamUs listing, the decedent was witnessed jumping out of a window. In addition, a suicide note was found in his pocket. The DME presumably concluded their investigation long ago. \r\n\r\nPlease search for a coroner's report(s) that could be labeled as \"exam protocol\", \"medical report\", \"case report\" or \"investigator's narrative.\"\r\n\r\n I am hopeful that the release of information will assist in the identification of this person.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Records that show all CPS incidents that included a student referral to law enforcement, including school-based resource officers, the underlying offense, the result of each referral, such as arrest or ticket/citation for municipal ordinance violation, and the gender, race, disability status and ELL status of the students who were referred for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and the 2023-2024 school years. Please also include the school in the data breakdown. The records could include, but not be limited to, disciplinary logs or reports, incident logs or reports, behavior resolution reports, and data that reflects the referrals, arrests and citations during the above years.\r\n\r\n2. The number of arrests of students on CPS property from July 1, 2021 to current broken down by CPS property name and address. Please break this data down by age of arrestee.\r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMiriam Bhimani",

Records that show all CPS incidents that included a student referral to law enforcement, including school-based resource officers, the underlying offense, the result of each referral, such as arrest or ticket/citation for municipal ordinance violation, and the gender, race, disability status and ELL status of the students who were referred for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and the 2023-2024 school years. Please also include the school in the data breakdown. The records could include, but not be limited to, disciplinary logs or reports, incident logs or reports, behavior resolution reports, and data that reflects the referrals, arrests and citations during the above years. \r\n2. The number of arrests of students on CPS property from July 1, 2021 to current broken down by CPS property name and address. Please break this data down by age of arrestee. RESPONSE : A portion of the information you seek can be found online. Please visit the CPS data website which includes police notification information: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ . Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the spreadsheets beside the \u201cSuspensions and Expulsions\u201d header. \r\nBe advised that you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department (CPD) for \u201carrests of students\u201d information at the following website: https://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-cpd/freedom-of-information-act-foia/ . \r\nPursuant to 5 ILCS 140/8.5: Records maintained online. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, to the contrary, a public body is not required to copy a public record that is published on the public body\u2019s website. The public body shall notify the requester that the public record is available online and direct the requester to the website where the record can be reasonably accessed. \r\nAs to the remainder of your request, be advised that the CPS FOIA office has determined that it does not properly identify a document(s) for search and would require a CPS FOIA Officer to conduct research and create a new record. To search for the information you seek in the manner requested, a FOIA Officer would need to go to various departments, research, create a list of possible responsive records, and answer questions, which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. \r\nUnder the Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nFurther, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.
