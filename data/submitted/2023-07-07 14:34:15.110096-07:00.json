As per RCW 42.56.520(3)(a) since your request for records is unclear our office will not be able to accept your public records request as written, we require clarification before searching for any records. \nPlease clarify the following: What Department or Office are you wishing to receive records from? Your request currently reads \"All current \"Brady lists\" and \"Giglio lists\" (per Brady v. Maryland/Giglio v. United States) maintained by your office.\" Ferry County Public Records does not hold or maintain a Brady List but the Ferry County Prosecuting Attorney's Office may. \n\nA request under the Public Records Act must be for an identifiable public record, see Hangartner v. City of Seattle, 151 Wn.2d 439, 447-48, 90 P.3d 26 (2004), and a mere request for information does not so qualify. Wood v. Lowe, 102 Wn.App. 872, 879, 10 P.3d 494 (2000); Bonamy v. City of Seattle, 92 Wn.App. 403, 410-12, 960 P.2d 447 (1998), review denied, 137 Wn.2d 1012 (1999). Local governments are not required to create documents in order to comply with a request for specific information. Citizens for Fair Share v. State Dep\u2019t of Corrections, 117 Wn.App. 411, 435, 72 P.3d 206 (citing Smith v. Okanogan County, 100 Wn.App. 7, 13-14 (2000)). See also WAC 44-14-04003(5). Nor are local governments obligated to compile information from various records so that information is in a form that is more useful to the requestor. Instead, they must produce existing records for review and copying. \n\nAs per RCW 42.56.520(3)(b) if you fail to respond to our request for clarification within 15 days from the date of this letter, we will presume your request has been abandoned and we will close our file. \n\nSincerely, \nMarah Hulse \nFerry County Public Records Officer \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Ferry County Public Records Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6HtRfOYLt5fXvpttM-2FU1HRz4NkQVz8GwY1vUjSAVtMrdixSCw-2Fr0ymw2asTQTJAITBaTiyBECtTRBJcH8R4TxGtjRjk9W4y7MnX9Ji6Qos5UwkKOhULcwkLeO9gRsTR5ezoG_122GdlcTw0sOmm1Kyp7OpLYiMu4-2BQFR2WV1Lgz3Lj-2B2PHruQzW69bKeJnHk2vUPr-2FbLul7n84oNlnscZL3Zj4bJXze77R5Xze68bhGVo9Y8uEkjxeK1UhnoYahb0kq-2FSF32H7CD8Lpi7ej2eqSXrwoJRhQd3Xwl9ErSHajjtDXb-2BOvb4skmHy-2FNYWRYxNK7bY8OEz2ing9dtoKyt48mLGC2Fe2H4U-2FpALxpUOa25mMynQvdoNq3DhggmsWLYZln-2BGUatqzVRa4RBK8B9m-2FGc3ZipgKqfGgrMGOSEa19OkoUgiBPC-2BUQP4X4fRWsgqr-2BIk0HdfgR8U4DPwGtLXhSJ-2FmgE5AvYRvqMl41InK8rAHaH6zMVBYPP2BMOxbHfY7Kr80JnNLTTu80hRbUCa-2FKshg-3D-3D)\n",

According to dispatch audio, officers with OPD responded to the scene and pursued a suspect on foot.  At 12:21 (near 1231 51st Ave), they had the suspect in custody.  I am looking for records that indicate the number of officers who responded to this incident, and, if any exist, investigative reports and body camera footage from the officers who responded.  I am also looking for any arrest reports.\r\n\r\nI request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED. Additionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me at dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Commerce, Office of Security (OSY):\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to Buzz the Security Bee, OSY's \"security mascot\" for the U.S. Census Bureau's National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana. According to the attached archived OYS website, Buzz was introduced in late 2006 and was developed to spread security awareness. The contact person on the website is Debra Rochner, so she may be one person to ask about responsive records (if she is still with the agency) or whose files or correspondence may have responsive records.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Buzz the Security Bee mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to OYS's decision to create a security mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Buzz-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books). Please include any related contracts or correspondence.\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Buzz costume that may have been created. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Buzz.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Buzz (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007, and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some around 2019.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using the Buzz mascot.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

As directed by our City Attorney, this is still considered an active investigation because of the appeals process that can happen after conviction so, investigative data is confidential under Minn.

Stat. 13.82 Subd. 7.Criminal investigative data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for the data defined in subdivisions 2, 3, and 6, investigative data collected or created by a law enforcement agency in order to prepare a case against a person, whether known or unknown, for the commission of a crime or other offense for which the agency has primary investigative responsibility are confidential or protected nonpublic while the investigation is active. Inactive investigative data are public unless the release of the data would jeopardize another ongoing investigation or would reveal the identity of individuals protected under subdivision 17. Images and recordings, including photographs, video, and audio records, which are part of inactive investigative files and which are clearly offensive to common sensibilities are classified as private or nonpublic data, provided that the existence of the images and recordings shall be disclosed to any person requesting access to the inactive investigative file. An investigation becomes inactive upon the occurrence of any of the following events:\r\n\r\n(a) a decision by the agency or appropriate prosecutorial authority not to pursue the case;\r\n\r\n(b) expiration of the time to bring a charge or file a complaint under the applicable statute of limitations, or 30 years after the commission of the offense, whichever comes earliest; or\r\n\r\n(c) exhaustion of or expiration of all rights of appeal by a person convicted on the basis of the investigative data.\r\n\r\nAny investigative data presented as evidence in court shall be public. Data determined to be inactive under clause (a) may become active if the agency or appropriate prosecutorial authority decides to renew the investigation.\r\n\r\nDuring the time when an investigation is active, any person may bring an action in the district court located in the county where the data are being maintained to authorize disclosure of investigative data. The court may order that all or part of the data relating to a particular investigation be released to the public or to the person bringing the action. In making the determination as to whether investigative data shall be disclosed, the court shall consider whether the benefit to the person bringing the action or to the public outweighs any harm to the public, to the agency or to any person identified in the data. The data in dispute shall be examined by the court in camera.\n",
