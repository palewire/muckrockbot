All records pertaining to the decision (or bases for the decision) identified in the January 31, 2025, memo entitled \"New Annual Media Rotation Program for Pentagon Press Corps.\"\r\n\r\n2. All policies, guidelines, or standards employed in identifying which outlet will be permitted to use the physical offices in the Pentagon.\r\n\r\n3. Any communications to or from John Ullyot between January 20, 2025, and January 31, 2025, pertaining to news media or the physical offices.\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited. I am primarily engaged in disseminating information because I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on the public website for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. This information is urgently needed in order to inform the public concerning an actual government activity, namely the Pentagon's allocation of physical spaces to particular news media outlets. This information concerns a breaking news story of general public interest.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",
