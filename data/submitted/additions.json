        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request to the DOJ Mail Referral Unit. Please forward this request to all DOJ components likely to have responsive records. In a previous request to OAG, OIP said OAG could locate \u201cno records.\u201d (See FOIA-2025-02723.)\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any letters issued by the Attorney General or the Department of Justice pursuant to Section 2(c) of Executive Order 14166 of January 20, 2025, \"Application of Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok.\"\r\n2. Any written guidance issued by the Attorney General or the Department of Justice pursuant to Section 2(b) of Executive Order 14166 of January 20, 2025, \"Application of Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay fees for this request up to a maximum of $200. If you estimate that the fees will exceed this limit, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the requested records exist at your agency for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) Executive Order 14166 of January 20, 2025 required your agency to issue the letter that I am requesting. Specifically, Section 2 Paragraph (c) of the Executive Order required \u201cthe Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order.\u201d\r\n\r\n(2) The existence of the requested letter from your agency is widely reported in the news. Specifically:\r\n\r\nThe New York Times: \u201cApple and Google had recently received letters from the Justice Department assuring them that they would not face fines for carrying TikTok in their app stores, said two people with knowledge of the communications.\u201d (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/technology/tiktok-apple-google-app-stores.html)\r\n\r\nBloomberg: \u201cApple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are restoring ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok to their app stores on Thursday following assurances in a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi that a ban wouldn\u2019t immediately be enforced.\u201d (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter)\r\n\r\nPolitico: \u201cApple restored the app after Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to the company assuring it will not face fines for violating a law that banned the video-sharing platform last month, according to a person familiar with the correspondence.\u201d (https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/google-apple-restore-tiktok-00204271)\r\n\r\nBased on the above, your agency possesses the records that I am requesting, and your agency is required to produce these records.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnthony Tan",
