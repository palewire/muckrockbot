Requests are processed in the order in which they are received; please do not submit duplicate entries for the same information. You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question based on your selected preferred method of delivery. PLEASE NOTE: The Ohio Public Records Act codified in R.C. Chapter 149 does not require a governmental body to create new information or records that do not already exist or are beyond state records retention schedules. \n \nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will be contacted when your request has been completed. \n \n \nAgain, thank you for using the Ohio Department of Public Safety - Public Records Center. Effective July 1, 2025, the Ohio State Highway Patrol will assess a fee of $38.90 per hour of video requested. This fee is the cost associated with reviewing, blurring, redacting, uploading, and producing the video records (R.C. 149.43(B)(1)). Once we receive the requested video recordings from the post, if any, an invoice shall be provided to you with the associated costs and must be paid prior to processing the videos. If an invoice is not paid within 30 days, the invoice will be cancelled and the request for videos will be closed. All other items contained in the request will still be processed and released in accordance with Ohio Public Records law regardless of whether an invoice is paid. For example, a requester who asks for body cam video, a case report, and a training record but does not pay the video invoice within 30 days will still receive the case report and training record but the video will not be processed and released. \nOhio Department of Public Safety \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Public Records Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXQvxtmHmisgNpM1Lxt4-2FVob0GJRrTcAeRiqPxk9fRqRD3liMTu-2Brx7V7STLfzt-2BlPKnD8Zau1TLT3khn-2B6ZmhE0-3DAa-k_WUmV03SEUI0HhYqD9O3XGLHWNd-2BRKaGf-2BQ2balIbQZtwkDRta2d-2F2lLQ1xmMzxLXY7ZlogA2IaqC558AW0Fh7LfROgL9tkfQFz41fM00Ax4zbU45SMXqzpPgGtd76peGe1TDcaL-2BkBMg6lYX3MTt2-2BnnKY04-2Fvf8fMUf41yvrC-2BVzQqGm-2FyKVdSU8WmLEmh5CyZhGJg3iqHnrSek4q7sW3GU2bXTDwvDe6Zf6zZr6Kw-3D)\n",

Please produce any plans or guidelines for how the Coalie mascot will be used.\r\n\r\n7. Please produce all documents in which the Coalie mascot appears, including electronic records such as social media posts.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to and processing of this request.",

This document was emailed to me on March 13, 2024 by Farley Santos after a meeting in the Mayor's Conference room. When I discovered the altered document, I was told had been destroyed as it is not a document I have ever submitted. I have attached the adulterated document to this request and am in possession of an executed copy of the original document I submitted to Health Director Kara Prunty for counter signature. This document I am requesting was drafted by Corporation Counsel and presented to me at a prior meeting for discussion purposes without draft or discussion on the face.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Paige",
