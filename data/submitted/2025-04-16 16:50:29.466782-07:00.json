Appropriate UC Office of the President offices are being notified of your request. Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production for all new requests is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is no central repository for all University records. The identification and collection of potentially responsive records is only the first step in the CPRA response process. The collected records must be reviewed by this office to ensure that they are in fact responsive to your request and to assess whether any legal privileges or exemptions from disclosure are applicable and whether redactions may be required to protect individuals\u2019 rights to privacy. Please also bear in mind that we are concurrently fulfilling numerous other requests, many of which were received before yours and that we generally process requests in the order in which they are received.\r\n\r\nAlthough the requested records have not yet been fully gathered and reviewed, it is possible that the requested material may contain information exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA. However, this is not a determination that the requested records are necessarily exempt from disclosure. This office will provide you with a status update after the requested records have been thoroughly reviewed.\r\n\r\nInquiries about this CPRA request should refer to CPRA #25-0128.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nUCOP Public Records\r\nUC, Office of the President\r\n1111 Franklin St.\r\nOakland, CA 94607\r\npra@ucop.edu<mailto:pra@ucop.edu>",

You requested the following: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAny and all personnel records and files related to complaints, misconduct, and disciplinary actions involving officer Kevin McLaughlin of the Bellingham Police Department. \r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting copies of the following documents: \r\n\r\nAny formal complaints filed against officer McLaughlin either by members of the public, or by fellow officers or his superiors. \r\n\r\nAny internal investigations conducted in response to these complaints or recorded misconduct, including all findings, communications, and conclusions. \r\n\r\nAny disciplinary actions taken against officer McLaughlin as a result of these complaints or misconduct, including but not limited to suspension records, reprimands, and training records related to corrective actions. \r\n\r\nAny records detailing the status, rank, and assignment of officer McLaughlin within the Bellingham Police Department. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The City needs additional time to locate and assemble the records requested and to determine whether any of the requested records are exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request.  For these reasons, I estimate that the City will need approximately 4 weeks in order to respond to your request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the police department may also exercise its right to provide the responsive records in installments as they become available. \r\n\r\nYou may contact Police Records at (360) 778-8700 if you have any questions about this request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nBellingham Police Records Division",
