        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to our request. I am writing to request payroll records (for all employees of your institution) from 1984 to 2022 in excel format (same format as the records provided in Adam Goldstein's request filed 9/20 for 2019-2020 records). The information I am looking for is nonpersonal (ie: Name, title, annual pay, year associated with pay, job description). We would like disaggregated figures, not aggregated. To assist in this process, I have listed with more specificity, the information we are looking for: \r\n\r\nAnnual Payroll Records of all, including full time, part time, and student, employees on your institution\u2019s payroll with fields:\r\nName (first and last)\r\nTotal Annual Pay (can be summed or disaggregated into base pay, other pay, overtime pay, benefits, etc).\r\nTitle\r\nYear\r\nDepartment\r\nJob description: the roles, responsibilities and duties of an employee\u2019s title. \r\nIf the institution has a system of categorizing employees please include their categorization and corresponding codebook if relevant. \r\n\r\nTo the extent any of these records may not exist or may not be disclosed, please disclose any segregable parts of relevant documents.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of quantifying staffing and spending changes over time. They are ultimately part of a project to research and educate the public about the makeup of staffing in higher education.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Goldstein",
