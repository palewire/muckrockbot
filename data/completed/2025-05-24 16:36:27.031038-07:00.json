Any and all agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), authorizations, or written permissions between the City of Clinton and Laurens County (or any of its departments) that authorize Clinton Sanitation to dispose of waste at the Laurens County Transfer Station (formerly the old Laurens landfill).\r\n\r\n2. Weigh tickets, intake logs, daily reports, manifests, billing statements, or invoices documenting any waste received from the City of Clinton or its sanitation department, including waste routed to Twin Chimney landfill.\r\n\r\n3. Internal emails, letters, or communications between Laurens County staff or officials and the City of Clinton (or its sanitation department) regarding trash disposal, dump site access, or waste transport arrangements.\r\n\r\n4. Any records or documentation maintained by Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department that reference the City of Clinton\u2019s use of county-operated waste facilities or routes used to deliver municipal waste.\r\n\r\nThis request follows a prior FOIA submission that was denied based on the claim that no responsive records exist. However, recent public statements from a sanitation worker have confirmed daily waste disposal operations by Clinton at the Laurens County Transfer Station, which is operated by the Laurens County Recycling and Collections Department. This indicates responsive documents do, in fact, exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdwin Chadwick",

You should receive it soon.\r\n\r\nThis request was submitted in good faith, and recent statements from a sanitation worker with direct knowledge contradict the County\u2019s prior response that no records exist. I\u2019m simply seeking clarity and transparency on a matter of public concern, and I would appreciate your continued cooperation in processing the request as written.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any further steps I need to complete.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n2. records sufficient to show the worrisome online behavior reports resulting in reporting to police broken down by CPS network, in aggregate from August 1, 2024 to current \r\nRESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office conducted a due diligence search with the CPS Office of Safety and Security and no responsive records were located. 3. email log to/from studentsafety@cps.edu from March 1, 2025 to March 31, 2025 RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA office submitted an electronic discovery request and concluded that it is unduly burdensome as it requires the search and/or collection of broad categories of records. The search parameters you provided yielded 6,872 e-mail messages and attachments. In order to comply with this request, the metadata for each of the over 6,872 e-mail messages would have to be downloaded and reviewed to determine if it is responsive to your request or is exempt from disclosure. To upload, read, and review the data and redact information not public under FOIA would take hours upon initial review of each email and would require review by multiple CPS FOIA Officers. It would also require research as student information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Illinois School Student Records Act. Thereby, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS. This\u00a0is\u00a0NOT\u00a0an automatic\u00a0denial\u00a0of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3 (g), we are asking that you narrow your request to more manageable proportions by replying to this email. If you do not narrow your request within 5 business days, this request will be closed. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. \r\nThank you for your request.

RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . Under the rules of FOIA, identifiable student-level confidential information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, section 7.5(r) exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/2(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been excluded pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Lastly, records have been redacted pursuant to Section 7(1)(d)(iv) which allows a public to withhold records/information that would unavoidably reveal the identity of a complainant or witness. In case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor: Office of the Attorney General: 500 South 2 nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Rand V. Araskog.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Duplicates from each year do not need to be completed. At a minimum, photos for 2023 - 2024 should be included. \r\n\r\nPrecedent: Santa Ana Police Department and LAPD have released their photos. A reminder that nothing in California Penal Code 832.7 mentions photographs in personnel records are kept confidential. Not only that, but videos and pictures of officers are regularly shared on social media. \r\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-las-second-lawsuit-against-journalist-over-police-headshots/ \r\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-13/city-of-la-officers-city \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipation cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoey Scott \r\nThe City of Torrance has reviewed its files and have located some records responsive to your request. Other information pertaining to your request from other departments/divisions may not be available at this time. \r\nPlease find the records pertaining to the information requested attached along with this message. If you created an Account using the online Torrance Public Records Center, you may also log in and download your documents using the request number provided above. \r\nThank you for your interest in the City of Torrance.

I also request records of any [2] proposed and/or enacted changes to said policies made on or after Nov. 6, 2024 until date of search, if such documents exist.\"\r\n\r\nRequest #1: Our complete Policies and Procedures are available in the public domain and as such, we are not required to provide them (2 AAC 96.100 (b)). I draw your attention to the following policy numbers:\r\n\r\n  *   202.15: Standards of Conduct\r\n  *   804.01: Special Management Prisoners\r\n  *   806.02: Prisoner Hygiene, Grooming and Sanitation\r\n  *   806.04: Prisoner Uniform\r\n  *   807.02: Access to Health Care Services\r\n  *   807.05: Use of Pharmaceutical Products\r\n  *   807.09: Medical Experimentation\r\n  *   807.23: Treatment and Management of Gender Dysphoria\r\n  *   807.24: Treatment and Management of Female Prisoners\r\n  *   808.09: Prisoner Housing\r\n  *   808.10 Prisoner Marriages\r\n  *   811.04: Search Upon Admission\r\n  *   811.05: Prisoner Property\r\n  *   811.08: Prisoner Orientation\r\n  *   812.10 Prisoner Employment\r\nThe (2022) Alaska DOC Gender Dysphoria Clinical Care Guide is attached.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use the following resources, available online: National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Standards for Health Services in Prisons, NCCHC Standards for Health Services in Jails, and NCCHC Standards for Mental Health Services in Correctional Facilities.\r\n\r\nRequest #2: No such records exist.\r\n\r\nBy regulation, this response technically constitutes a partial denial of your records request (because certain records you request do not exist).  For that reason, I am required to provide you the following information. I have been delegated the authority to deny public records requests for the Department of Corrections; you may administratively appeal this denial to the agency head, by complying with the procedures of 2 AAC 96.340.  You may pursue immediate judicial review of this denial by seeking an injunction from the Superior court under AS 40.25.125.  Choosing not to pursue an injunction in Superior court will have no adverse effect on your rights in the administrative appeal.  An administrative appeal from the denial of a request for public records requires no appeal bond.  Copies of 2 AAC 96.335 - 2 AAC 96.350 are enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nBetsy\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DBC8A1.D796B670]",

A copy of the Request is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 10/20/2022, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Acknowledged receiving my FOIA Request on 10/18/2022 and reported the following Tracking Numbers for it: 23-00135-F, 23-00499-F, 23-00566-F, 23-00567-F, 23-00568-F, 23-00569-F, 23-00570-F.  Veterans Health Administration stated in that Acknowledgement that the Requested Records, if they exist, will be maintained by Veterans Health Administration; as well as other divisions of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including the VA Office of the Inspector General, all of which VHA is coordinating with to satisfy the Request.  A copy of VHA's 10/20/2022 Acknowledgement is attached to this Letter within \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 11/17/2022, I received an \"Agency Final Response\" to my FOIA Request from Government Information Specialist Barya Offer, on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  The sum of Offer's purported \"Agency Final Response\" is, \"please see the Agency Final Response regarding your request\"; with an attached PDF file named \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial.pdf\".  Said file is a letter from Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthhee G. Bellamy of the VA OIG Release Information Office - notifying me that VA OIG assigned Tracking Number 23-00006-FOIA to my Request, among other things.  A copy of VHA's 11/17/2022 \"Agency Final Response\" is included in the \"Appendix A\" attachment to this Letter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" letter from VA OIG on 11/17/2022 is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix B\"; and declares \"we were unable to locate any responsive records pertaining to your request\"; yet only as the Request pertains to Inspector General Michael J. Missal in VA OIG Records.  Unfortunately, VA OIG's Response to my Request is a false statement of fact; provable by one of many Records in my possession which would have to be included in any satisfactory Response to my Request, notwithstanding whether that Response is from VA OIG, VHA or otherwise applicable officse / divisions of US DVA.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned Record in my possession is an e-mail I sent to Inspector General Missal and others on 05/27/2022 regarding VCOEB, that a simple search for the text \"VCOEB\" will produce upon querying Inspector General Missal's e-mail correspondence between 05/01/2022 and Present.  Given that e-mail was not returned to sender and Inspector General Missal directly corresponded with me several times in the recent past from the same e-mail address; and because information about a Federal Advisory Committee that holds Public Meetings in Open Session on Public land for Public attendance (as Publicly Noticed in the Federal Register), is not qualified to be suppressed due limited National Security provisions under 5 U.S.C. Statutes governing FOIA - apparently the minimum effort to satisfactorily Respond to my Request is beyond some U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Officials' intent to perform...  Despite VA OIG's purported \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" Letter probably cost Federal Taxpayer's far more to produce than performing the simple searches to lawfully satisfy and Respond to my Request will; presuming Public Records required to satisfy my Request were not unlawfully tampered with. Even in that hypothetical scenario though, the Records are obtainable from one of many archives US DVA is Mandated to retain as National Security against the tampering or loss of such Records.  A copy of my aforementioned 05/27/2022 e-mail to Inspector General Missal and one of many e-mails Inspector General Missal sent me from the same address he received my 05/27/2020 e-mail at, are attached to this Letter as \"Appendix C\".\r\nNotwithstanding the validity or lack thereof in VA OIG's Response to a portion of my Request through VHA, the partial Response is not a legitimate, full Response to my Request; despite it being uncannily misrepresented as such by false statements of fact.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is at least procedurally failing to Respond to my Request on time in accordance with Federal Public Law.  I reassure you the Requested Records regarding a Federal Advisory Committee with a Public Law Mandate and Charter to improve outcomes for Veterans via Public Meetings held in Open Session here in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran Homelessness - are delays of Public Records offering a direct positive impact on disabled homeless Veterans' probability of survival and General Welfare of U.S. Taxpayers  Contrarily, the ongoing and baseless delays Responding to my Request are negatively impacting disabled homeless Veterans and Federal Taxpayers, until and unless the Request is fully and legitimately Responded to.\r\n\r\nGiven my maintained Good Faith in the majority of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Staff's Public Integrity and capacity to ethically perform their duties in accordance with the Department's true Mission - I expect nothing less than the People of the United States of America do in this matter; a swift, comprehensive, accurate and satisfactory Response to my Request in accordance with Our Rights, Public Laws and increasing expenditures to expect no less of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' performance in respect thereof.\r\n\r\nI declare under under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Missal.\r\n\r\nOn 12/12/2022 US DVA FOIA Officer as well as Management and Program ANALYST Mark Littlefield Responded on behalf of US DVA with a total of 8 e-mail records pertaining to only two of the Request's identified subjects; namely VA Officers Chihung Szeto and Eugene Skinner.\r\n\r\nOn 12/28/2022 - a Government Informaiton Specialist in the VA Office of Inspector General Information Release Office named Ms. Johnson Responded with some to all requested Information Requested as pertains to VA OIG Michael Missal. While thankful for the provided Information Requested, the partial Response thoroughly proves that: a) VA OIG via Ruthlee G. Bellamy provided a False and / or otherwise improper \"Final Agency Response\" of \"Full Denial\" and b) given the Fact some of the Requested Information provided via Ms. Johnson contains such regarding Eugene Skinner and Chihung Szeto that is not in ANALYST Mark Littlefield's Response for such information; it's apparent Mr. Littlefield's account of the search for such Requested Information is False, erroneous or reliant upon False information directly provided by Eugene Skinner and Chihung Szeto.\r\n\r\nTo date none of the Requested Information regarding Mr.s Harris, Trinh, McDonough, Merchant, Braverman, MacGahran, Simms, Rychalski and VAPD has been provided; and in light of False, erroneous and / or misleading information so slowly provided in Response to this Request - there's evident concern for a lack of integrity and violation of Federal Public Law governing FOIA. I respectfully demand a diligent, full, complete, honest and lawful Response to my long overdue Request pertaining to Public Officials' Federal Advisory Committee records pertaining to the VCOEB within the Request's specified time period without further delay and apparent suppression of said Information which the U.S. Federal Government is mandated to provide.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe decisions issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals from December 2021 until the date of processing of this request, arising from cases decided by Immigration Judge Zol Damon Rainey, that were administratively closed, reversed, background check remand, and/or remand (including remands to a different IJ).\r\n\r\nI would request any printouts, summaries, spreadsheets, reports, or other records or datasets that may encompass or address how many of removal orders included a negative credibility determination for any Respondent(s) for whom IJ Rainey issued removal orders in protection/form I-589 cases (in other words, decisions on Asylum, Wittholding of Removal, or Relief under the Convention Against Torture), after merits/individual hearings occurred, between December 2021 and the date of processing of this request.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence or communications in any medium (including but not limited to any email, fax, letter, text/SMS/MMS, memorandum, voicemail, audio recording, sticky-note, or any attachment thereto, and any conversion of any of the foregoing from a digital to analog form/format, or vice-versa) to or from IJ Rainey, from December 2021 through present time, regarding removal or any other immigration proceedings, containing the words \"credibility,\" \"credible,\" \"incredible,\" \"incoherent,\" \"demeanor,\" \"candor,\" \"evasive,\" \"non-responsive,\" \"responsiveness,\" \"inconsistent,\" \"consistent,\" \"consistency,\" \"facial expression(s),\" \"body language,\" \"standard language,\" or \"addendum of law,\" or any abbreviation, contraction, misspelling, pluralization, or paraphrase thereof.\r\n\r\nCopies of each and every \"standard language addendum of law\" or any substantially similar 'boilerplate' or 'template' document utilized by IJ Rainey as an exhibit in, as an attachment to, or as a drafting aid for any merits decision in a protection/form I-589 matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested records will be made available to the general public via a FOIA records clearinghouse, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes; rather, the results will be disseminated to interested individuals free of charge, and with no pecuniary gain to the Requestor, who is not the subject of any of these records. Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nDerrick J. Hensley\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks.

For this Office to respond to your request, EOIR would have to search through hundreds of emails. The FOIA is not intended to allow requesters to conduct a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d through agency files. Dale v. IRS, 238 F. Supp. 2d 99, 104-05 (D.D.C. 2002). This protects the ability of federal agencies to prioritize their resources notwithstanding any obligation to provide access to records under FOIA. Int\u2019l Counsel Bureau v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 723 F. Supp. 2d 54, 59\u201360 (D.D.C. 2010). \r\n\r\nYour request is not reasonably described because it is overly broad and would result in an unreasonably burdensome search. As a result, your request is on hold. Please contact EOIR to clarify your request. If we do not hear from you within 30 calendar days of this notice, we will assume that you are no longer interested and your request will be administratively closed. \r\nIf youneed any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of yourrequest, please contact the analyst who processed your request or the EOIR FOIAPublic Liaison at EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov.Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services(OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about theFOIA mediation services they offer.

You requested, as quoted,\r\n\r\n  *   \"Copies of any and all communications, including emails, email attachments, text messages, voicemails, and memos, held by the Department of Veterans Affairs referencing the Department of Government Efficiency's \"DOGE\" access to agency data systems and records\r\n  *   The list of Department of Government Efficiency \"DOGE\" employees with a \"@va.gov\" email domain.\"\r\n\r\nSearches Dated 2/27/25, 2/28/25, 3/10/25, 3/20/25, 4/9/25, & 4/11/25\r\nOn February 27, 2025, our search cut-off date, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through the VA Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solution (VIEWS), VA's official information system for interagency memoranda, agreement, access requests, contracts.  An OSVA FOIA Officer used the following search terms: DOGE AND (\"information sharing\").  On February 28, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS with the following search terms: DOGE AND access.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 2025, our search cut-off date, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Identity and Access Management (IAM) office search for and provide a list of VA information systems that Mr. Justin Fulcher, a Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff and VA Liaison to DOGE, accessed including the last accessed date.  On March 20, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA OI&T IAM office search for the same information for Mr. Cary Volpert, another Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff and VA Liaison to DOGE.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2025, and April 7, 2025, the OI&T IAM office provided such list.  None of the information systems accessed are VHA or VBA Privacy Act Systems of Records.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS for Inter-Agency Agreements, Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement, and Inter-Agency Contracts.  On April 9, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer used the following search terms: \"DOGE\" AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\").\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS with the following search terms:\r\n\r\n  1.  \"DOGE\" AND \"contract\";\r\n  2.  (\"Government Efficiency\") AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\" OR \"contract\"); and,\r\n  3.  (\"Digital Service\") AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\" OR \"contract\").\r\nOur searches through VIEWS dated February 27, 2025, February 28, 2025, April 9, 2025, and April 11, 2025 yielded no responsive records.\r\n\r\nAll-Other Fee Category\r\nWe have placed you in the all-other category.  For this FOIA request, OSVA does not charge any FOIA fees.  OSVA reserves the right to charge FOIA fees for any future FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nInitial Agency Decision\r\nPlease find attached two (2) pages, which the VA releases in full.  Mr. Fulcher and Mr. Volpert have not accessed any VHA or VBA Privacy Act Systems of Records.\r\n\r\nFOIA Mediation\r\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. Under the provisions of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the following contact information is provided to assist FOIA requesters in resolving disputes:\r\nVA Central Office FOIA Public Liaison:\r\nEmail Address: vacofoiaservice@va.gov<mailto:vacofoiaservice@va.gov>\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)\r\nEmail Address: ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nMailing address:\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\nThis concludes OSVA's Initial Agency Decision to request 25-08907-F.
