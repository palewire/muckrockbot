The agency acknowledged receiving this request on May 23, 2023, and produced records on February 8, 2024. \r\n\r\nPlease produce at minimum, \r\n\r\n(1) the FOIA tasker CBP FOIA created assigning this request, \r\n(2) the Daily Media Summary CBP FOIA created including this request, and \r\n(3) the processing form any custodians created indicated systems of records searched, time spent searching, search terms, the date the search was tasked, and the time period searched. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. The records CBP FOIA released on February 8, 2024, encompass 44 individual deaths over a 9-month period (rather than the 99.5-month period we sought). \r\n2. The records set contains least 8 in-custody CBP deaths for which no prior record of public release by CBP appears to exist, in contravention of the agency's Death Notifications policy. \r\n3. The records set omits several publicly reported in-custody CBP deaths during the 9-month the records encompass, apparently putting CBP in violation of its obligations under DCRA. \r\n4. The General Accountability Office has repeatedly concluded CBP needed to improve its death reporting mechanisms. \r\n5. In-custody CBP deaths and federal law enforcement agencies' noncompliance with DCRA have been subject of widespread media criticism, with repeat findings of the noncompliance. \r\n6. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Otherwise known as Alex Efthim or Alex, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts at Washington University in 1938 and got a Masters in Public Law from Columbia University, Masters in Public Law in 1940. He served as a U.S. Army Air Force Captain during World War II from 1943 to 1946. He was later a union organizer in St. Louis, including in favor of the OPA (Office of Price Administration), critical of Rep. Walter C. Ploeser, while part of the American Veterans Committee, Fight Inflation Committee (his organization), Congress of Industrial Organizations, and other groups in the city. He married Helen Eileen Mills in 1950 in St. Louis. He later worked as a major organizer of Mobilization of Youth, an antipoverty group in New York in the 1960s, headed the Jimmerson Houses Committee for Cooperative Living in Brooklyn and served as a consultant for the Brownsville Community Council. Before this, he was education director of the International Association of Machinists Local 397 and Hotel Trades Council in New York.

For\r\nbackground, he, born in St. Louis, Missouri in November 1916 to two\r\nAlbanian immigrants, Christo E. Efthim and Olga Peppo. Otherwise known as\r\nAlex Efthim or Alex, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts at Washington\r\nUniversity in 1938 and got a Masters in Public Law from Columbia\r\nUniversity, Masters in Public Law in 1940. He served as a U.S. Army Air\r\nForce Captain during World War II from 1943 to 1946. He was later a union\r\norganizer in St. Louis, including in favor of the OPA (Office of Price\r\nAdministration), critical of Rep. Walter C. Ploeser, while part of the\r\nAmerican Veterans Committee, Fight Inflation Committee (his organization),\r\nCongress of Industrial Organizations, and other groups in the city. He\r\nmarried Helen Eileen Mills in 1950 in St. Louis. He later worked as a major\r\norganizer of Mobilization of Youth, an antipoverty group in New York in the\r\n1960s, headed the Jimmerson Houses Committee for Cooperative Living in\r\nBrooklyn and served as a consultant for the Brownsville Community Council.\r\nBefore this, he was education director of the International Association of\r\nMachinists Local 397 and Hotel Trades Council in New York. He became a\r\nprofessor at Wayne State University in 1968 and retired in 1985, publishing\r\narticles such as \"We Care\" in Kansas: The Non-Professionals Revolt\" in The\r\nNation in 1968 and \"Serving the U.S. Work Force: A New Constituency For\r\nSchools of Social Work\" in Journal of Education for Social Work in 1976. He\r\nwas reportedly denied tenure at Wayne State University because of the high\r\ndegree of \"advocacy\" in his teaching and field activity. He died on October\r\n13, 1990. I'm hopeful that this brief biographical information will help\r\nwith location of some records.\r\n\r\nPlease include \"Alexander Christopher Efthim,\" \"Alex C. Efthim,\" \"Alex\r\nEfthim\", \"Alex\" or any common abbreviations of his name in your search.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform\r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer\r\nthe request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or\r\nCD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The reason I ask, is I can run a single report that includes the times of all of the sheriff office employees from July 1, 2023 to present, but it would not be broken up into the bi-weekly timesheets. If this is ok, then there would not be a charge and I can email it back pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nIf you need it broken into Bi-weekly timesheets, then I would need to run several reports and it would take more time for me to create the requested info, so there would be a small charge for that.\r\n\r\nPlease clarify your request and if you need the bi-weekly reports I will provide you with an estimated cost.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDarcie Ragsdale\r\n\r\nHuman Resources | Bosque County\r\n\r\nPO Box 647 | Meridian, TX 76665\r\n\r\n104 West Morgan | Meridian, TX 76665\r\n\r\nP: 254-978-4810\r\n\r\nF: 254-651-1046 \r\n\r\nEmail: hr@bosquecounty.us",

I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n2. I have submitted more than 200 FOA requests to DHS agency FOIA offices since May 2019. \r\n3. The vast majority of these requests remain in extended backlogs, often with processing times that far exceed the median and average times reported by the agency. \r\n4. DHS Agency FOIA offices have repeatedly excepted my requests from a first-in, first-out processing by providing responses to FOIA requests that contain the same information I sought, despite their filing the request after I did. \r\n5. DHS has not promulgated any regulation or published any subregulatory rule, policy, procedure, guidance, manual, or other instruction to staff regarding the targeting or use of a vexsome filer or similar designation. \r\n6. Consequently, any application of such internal designation to requests I have submitted would appear violate 5 USC 552(a)(2)(E)(i) & (ii). \r\n7. DHS FOIA offices have repeatedly been held to engage in a pattern and practice of FOIA violations by federal courts. See, e.g., Owen v. ICE (CD Cal), Nightengale v. USCIS (ND Cal). \r\n8. There is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged government misconduct - namely, the use/misuse of a vexsome FOIA filer list to deny, slow, or meter requestors' FOIA productions based on the frequency with which we exercise our statutory rights to demand information from our (nominally) democratically accountable institutions. \r\n9. Placing this request in the regular track for processing will doom it to multi-month, if not multi-year purgatory at your agency's current processing rate, effectively covering up the potentially unlawful practice of discriminatory treatment based on the frequency with which a particular requestor exercises their statutory right to seek information about what our government is up to. \r\n\r\nThank you for your timely consideration of this expedited processing request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll investigative records that reference the company FlagWix (flagwix.com). FlagWix began selling overtly political flags during the 2020 political election. FlagWix made a massive advertising buy on Facebook and Instagram running targeted ads to residents of the state of Georgia offering Confederate flags. These ads, which Meta's corporate legal team was alerted to of at the time, likely ran afoul of Meta's advertising rules at the time. \r\n\r\nAccording to a book scheduled to be published in coming months, Flagwix \"invented\" and popularized an American flag design featuring Jesus Christ. The company also reportedly created (and then marketed) an all black flag American flag that gained popularity among far-right activists in the United States in 2021. \r\n\r\nReporting suggests that FlagWix is based in China, and the ownership of the company is likely connected to the Chinese Communist Party. The personal information of FlagWix customers provides a Chinese Communist Party-linked entity with a trove of information regarding the political beliefs of numerous American citizens. \r\n\r\nIf Flagwix (or it's subsidiary dixiebone.com) are currently under Bureau investigation, please do not deny the entire request and release any information available under the law. If you cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the Bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
