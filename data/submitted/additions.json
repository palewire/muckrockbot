        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Alabama Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of all guidelines, protocols, training materials, educational materials, and screening or diagnostic materials used by the university\u2019s athletics department related to the prevention of disordered eating, identification of student-athletes at risk of developing disordered eating, and establishing a chain of reporting for a student-athlete flagged as at risk for developing or exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating. Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders. \r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Alabama Open Records Law \u00a7 36-12-40 et seq.. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Hannah Beckler.",
