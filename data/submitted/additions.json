In August 1996, the Company was advised that the investigation had been terminated and that, at this time, no enforcement action has been recommended by the staff of the SEC.\"\r\n\r\nI request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is very much in the public interest. The requested documents will be processed for the purpose of news gathering, as I am a freelance journalist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. \r\n\r\nIt is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nC. Collins",
