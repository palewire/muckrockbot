        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

This request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), codified in Sections 4-101 et seq. of the General Provisions Article of the Maryland Code. A request for public information under the PIA must be submitted to the custodian of public records. Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-202(a). Each governmental entity is the custodian of its own records. See Baltimore City Code, Art. 1 \u00a7 10-1. This response is on behalf of DOF.\r\n\r\nThe search for the documents you have requested and their review may take more than 10-days due to the volume of documentation you requested and the fact that many City personnel are teleworking with limited access to hard copies of responsive files. Once the documents are gathered, we will then know the volume of the responsive documentation.  The PIA allows the government to charge for any time past two hours that it takes to gather, review and redact, if necessary, any documents requested at the rate of the employee performing the work after giving the first two hours labor for free.  Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-206; accord Md. Public Information Act Compliance Board Opinion 16-05. If there are a substantial number of documents to review that will take us more than two hours, we will let you know of the cost and where to send payment, which is required before any documents will be reviewed. See, e.g., Ireland v. Shearin, 417 Md. 401, n. 412, n.8 (2010).\r\n\r\nWe will let you know as soon as the documents are gathered if there will be any charges associated with your request.\r\n\r\nNothing in this response is intended to indicate that any records sought from City agencies exist or to waive any privileges held by the Mayor and City Council.  You may contest this response by filing a complaint in Circuit Court pursuant to PIA Section \u00a7 4-362.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9502E.96BA26C0]<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baltimorecity.gov%2F&data=05%7C01%7CAhleah.Knapp%40baltimorecity.gov%7C7b1e63fb066144740d8f08db1e6fa302%7C312cb126c6ae4fc2800d318e679ce6c7%7C0%7C0%7C638137237075316902%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mn0tnOouLIdsQApN0rsJczmvosLIWQalaesaMh8rWqQ%3D&reserved=0>\r\nDepartment of Law\r\nAhleah Knapp\r\nLegal Specialist\r\nAdvice & Opinions Practice Group\r\nBaltimore City Department of Law\r\n100 N.

Ms. Carnahan's personal email address has been redacted because disclosing it would violate her right to privacy.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Youth Services Records Access Officer: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n  1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DYS custody (including \r\n  either detained or committed youth) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, \r\n  hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate \r\n  the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, \r\n  ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n \r\n  2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\r\n    a. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance) as to how your \r\n    agency operates or utilizes GPS monitoring,\r\n    b. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\r\n    c. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\r\n   d. Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants on ELMO,\r\n   e. The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\r\n   f. Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between the Department of Youth Services and the \r\n   Massachusetts Probation Service or its ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DYS custody on expedited release under \r\n   community supervision or \r\n \r\n       3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the Department of Youth Services\u2019s custody, on expedited release under community supervision or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\r\n            l. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\r\n           m. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO \r\n           n. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, expedited release under community supervision etc.)\r\n           o. Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\r\n           p. County and Zip Code of individual\r\n           q. Age of individual\r\n           r. Gender of individual \r\n           s. Race of individual\r\n           t. Ethnicity of individual \r\n           u. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\r\n           v. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the \r\n            violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable. \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Youth Services. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nErin Stewart\r\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience.

The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as\r\n    well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the\r\n    request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7\r\n    552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative\r\n    of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for\r\n    which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    \r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Copies of Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COAs) granted to the FBI\r\n    from 1995 to the present, along with applications/requests submitted by the\r\n    FBI regardless of whether they were granted or not.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the records you sent over only have medical fees, but not room and board costs charged to those incarcerated in your facilities. I have found statutory evidence that suggests the department is authorized to collect room and board fees. Below for your reference is the statute:\r\n\r\nSec. 33.30.201.   Compensation of prison inmates; deductions; disbursement; liens. \r\n (a) Each prisoner who is productively employed, as defined in AS 33.30.191(g)(1) or (3) \u2014 (5), may receive for that work compensation at a rate determined by the commissioner under this section if the money is available from legislative appropriations. Compensation established by the commissioner under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065; however, if required to comply with a federal statute or regulation, a higher compensation may be established by the commissioner.\r\n(b) If compensation established under (a) of this section is 50 percent or more of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065, the commissioner may deduct the cost of confinement of the prisoner up to the statewide average cost of confinement before disbursements are made under (c) of this section.\r\n(c) The commissioner shall disburse compensation received under (a) of this section, after any deduction required by (b) of this section, in the following order of priority:\r\n     (1) for support of the prisoner's dependents, if any;\r\n     (5) for the payment of fees for the prisoner's utilities services under AS 33.30.017;\r\n\r\nI would like to request all reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding the room and board fees assessed to those incarcerated in Alaska DOC facilities or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding room and board costs, including the number of individuals charged and the total amount of room and board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMercy Loyo",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

These are public records totaling 63 pages and 9 videos. Due to file size, the records referenced above are available for download at: https://uofi.box.com/s/tfjptsz5nockn1h96hq133e1gvds8mfy.\r\n\r\nThis link will expire in 10 days.

If you do choose to view the file in the Box interface, the download button appears as a white arrow at the top right of the viewing window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome records provided to you are in XLS format.

Pursuant to Section 1-7 of that Act, those records are confidential and may never be disclosed to the general public (705 ILCS 405/1-7).\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7(1)(b) that exempts from disclosure \"Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\" This includes personal telephone numbers, license plate numbers, home addresses, driver's license numbers, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7(1)(c) that exempts from disclosure \"Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\" This includes dates of birth, race, and victim and suspect identification information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7(1)(d)(iv) that exempts records that would \"unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies.\" The requested documents include information about the identity of (or information provided by) person(s) who provided information to a law enforcement agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7.5(bb) that exempts from disclosure \"Information which is or was prohibited from disclosure by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\" This includes juvenile law enforcement records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a right, under the law, to seek a review of this response by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) in the Office of the Attorney General.

The records you seek are\r\nnot readily available and would be unduly burdensome to gather, compile,\r\nredact, and production.  Please narrow your request in both time and scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nA public entity need not produce records that are not readily available and\r\nwould require research, compilation, and redaction to produce. *See* NRS\r\n239.010 (NPRA applies to \u201cpublic books and public records\u201d); NRS 239.0107\r\n(NPRA applies to a \u201cpublic book or record\u201d); NAC 239.867 (agency is not\r\nrequired to create a public record that does not exist); *Public Employees\u2019\r\nRetirement System of Nevada v.

On 8/29/2022, we advised you that your request expedited processing was denied, and your request was assigned to the appropriate Justice Management Division (JMD) staff office for processing.  For your information, the JMD and the Department of Justice (Department) assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.

As mentioned above, each request is handled on a \u201cfirst in - first out\u201d basis in relation to other requests in that same track.  Currently, that office is processing 23 other Complex FOIAs that are ahead of you in their queue. We have contacted HR to see if they can provide us with any additional information to pass onto you.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-514-3101 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).
