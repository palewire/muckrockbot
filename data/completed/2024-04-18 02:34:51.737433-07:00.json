Doing so would remove approximately 1685 pages. There are approximately 18,649 potentially responsive pages, so removing the court documents alone wouldn't be enough to move the request from the extra-large track (> 8,000 pages). We would be happy to make this reduction for you, but would ask that you consider making a further reduction to move the request into one of the faster tracks. Would you possibly be willing to reduce the request to up to 950 pages to move the request into the medium track? You are always welcome to request additional material once a release has been made. We could take the first 950 pages, the last 950, or split between the beginning and end of the file if you would like.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to move forward.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n540-868-1695",

All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of parolees who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. To the extent available, we are interested in records that indicate the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n\r\n2. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are on Parole or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Your office responded to a public records request from me on November 10, 2022 with an extract of data. We are requesting  the same columns of data, only with an updated date range. \r\nSpecifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who activated ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time with the following headers:\r\n1.\tID (This was numbered from 1)\r\n2.\tELMO Activation Date\t\r\n3.\tELMO Terminated Date\t\r\n4.\tClose Date\t\r\n5.\tAge at Activation\t\r\n6.\tGender\t\r\n7.\tRace\t\r\n8.\tEthnicity\t\r\n9.\tPotential Most Serious Offense Type\r\n10.\t Any geographic data available (i.e. county or zip code) (This final column was not included in the 2022 records production.  We request it this time!) \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person under the supervision of the Massachusetts Parole Board. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filed electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\nSincerely,\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of parolees who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. To the extent available, we are interested in records that indicate the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO. 2. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are on Parole or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Your office responded to a public records request from me on November 10, 2022 with an extract of data. We are requesting the same columns of data, only with an updated date range.\r\nSpecifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who activated ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time with the following headers:\r\n1. ID (This was numbered from 1)\r\n2. ELMO Activation Date\r\n3. ELMO Terminated Date\r\n4. Close Date\r\n5. Age at Activation\r\n6. Gender\r\n7. Race\r\n8. Ethnicity\r\n9. Potential Most Serious Offense Type\r\n10. Any geographic data available (i.e. county or zip code) (This final column was not included in the 2022 records production. We request it this time!)\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached spreadsheet. Additionally, you can refer to the MPB Annual Statistical Reports posted on the Parole Board\u2019s website, which has a section on ELMO. We are not charging any fees for this request at this time.  If you wish to challenge any aspect of this response, you may appeal to the Supervisor of Public Records following the procedure set forth in 950 C.M.R. 32.08, a copy of which is available at http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/law-lib/laws-by-source/cmr/. You may also file a civil action in accordance with M.G.L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A.\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nStacy Book\r\nCompliance Officer/\r\nRecords Access Officer\r\nMassachusetts Parole Board\r\n12 Mercer Road\r\nNatick, MA 01760",

This change was not communicated to me during the period of my request, which may have contributed to the lack of response.\r\nThis appeal is based on the failure of Capital Region BOCES to provide the requested records or to issue a formal denial within the timeframe stipulated by the New York Freedom of Information Law. The prolonged silence and lack of communication following the initial acknowledgment and subsequent promise of delivery constitute a de facto denial of access to the requested records.\r\n\r\nI understand that personnel changes and administrative updates can affect the processing of FOIL requests. However, the public's right to access information should not be hindered by such transitions. The lack of response and the summary denial of access to the requested records undermine the principles of transparency and accountability that the FOIL is designed to uphold.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I respectfully request a review of my appeal and a prompt response to my original FOIL request. If the requested records cannot be provided, I seek a detailed explanation for their unavailability or a justification for denial based on specific exemptions under the FOIL.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this appeal. I look forward to a resolution that aligns with the spirit and letter of the Freedom of Information Law.",

I am looking for all responses to this form (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/at00sbh3yv/tellus) for an New Jersey earthquake on April 5th.  Please include all responses received up to the date that this request is processed. \r\n\r\nAs a reporter for the WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the law. \r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me or call me. WIRED\u2019s legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Mehrotra:\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 2024, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office received your FOIA request dated April 9, 2024, and assigned it control number DOI-USGS-2024-000126.  Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll responses to this form (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/at00sbh3yv/tellus) for an New Jersey earthquake on April 5th. Please include all responses received up to the date that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g).\r\n\r\nYou have asked us to waive the fees for processing your request.  Our FOIA regulations require that bureaus will waive, or partially waive, fees if disclosure of all or part of the information is:\r\n\r\nIn the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, and\r\n\r\nNot primarily in your commercial interest.\r\n\r\nSee 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.45(a).  Our FOIA regulations also provide specific criteria that are used to determine whether these two requirements are met.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.48.\r\n\r\nYour request meets the criteria and supports your requested fee waiver; therefore, your request for a fee waiver has been approved.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track.  There are 20 requests pending ahead of yours in this processing track.  Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by May 8, 2024.\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently-assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly.  If you have any questions about this, please contact us at foia@usgs.gov.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\nCollege Park, MD  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:  (202) 741-5770\r\nFax:  (202) 741-5769\r\nToll-free:  1 (877) 684-6448\r\n E-mail:  ogis@nara.gov\r\nWeb:  https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.\r\n\r\nContact information for the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, who you may also seek dispute resolution services from, is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about your request, you may contact by email at foia@usgs.gov.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEric J.

The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Part three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 Additionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Part three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 Additionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

        "communication": "Mr. Delaware:\r\n \r\nMy name is John Laster.  I serve as a FOIA liaison for access to\r\nPresidential records.  I wanted to write you to address your two\r\noutstanding FOIAs at the Reagan Library.  I am not sure if you have yet\r\nseen the response from Gary M Stern, NARA's General Counsel and Chief\r\nFOIA Officer, to Patrice McDermott concerning the Listserv post in May. \r\n(I've included the full response from Gary if you haven't seen it yet.)\r\n \r\nFirst, we apologize for any confusion our response caused.  The\r\ninformation below explains in more detail what our current policy is, so\r\nI won't repeat it.  However, after reading that, we would like to know\r\nhow to proceed with your current FOIA request.  We can treat it as a\r\nFOIA and refer the material to the equity agency(ies) for a\r\ndeclassification review.  Or you can email Shelly Williams, the FOIA\r\ncoordinator at the Reagan Library, and request that your FOIA be closed\r\nand that we proceed to review the material under the Mandatory\r\nDeclassification Review policy established under E.O. 13526.  The basic\r\ndifference between a declassification review under FOIA versus MDR has\r\nto do with appeal rights.  With FOIA, once a decision is made, you can\r\nappeal once, followed by the choice to sue for release of the material. \r\nUnder MDR, you can appeal to the Interagency Security Classification\r\nAppeals Panel (ISCAP).  Most requesters tend to choose the MDR route,\r\nbecause they like the option of an ISCAP review.  However, this is\r\ncompletely your call.  We would just ask that you email us to clarify\r\nwhether you want a declassification review under FOIA or MDR.\r\n \r\nSecond, Shelly informs me that you have a second FOIA request related\r\nto President Reagan's \"Tear Down This Wall\" speech.  All material\r\nrelated to this topic has been processed.  Shelly will send you a letter\r\nto that effect very shortly, but I wanted to give you a heads-up that\r\nmaterial on the topic is already available.\r\n \r\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me or the\r\nReagan Library.  Again, we apologize for any confusion on our part.\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nJohn \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nPatrice:  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn response to the Listserve post of May 15, 2012, on \"National\r\nArchives no longer forwarding FOIAs for MDR,\" we are writing to clarify\r\nhow NARA\u2019s Presidential Libraries generally handle FOIA requests for\r\nPresidential records that include classified information.  The post\r\nresponded to an informal response that the Reagan Library provided to a\r\nresearcher about a specific request, which has been misunderstood.  \r\n \r\nSeveral years ago, Presidential Libraries that process FOIA requests\r\n(the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Libraries subject to the Presidential\r\nRecords Act) stopped automatically sending all classified documents\r\nwithheld under FOIA exemption (b)(1) to other agencies for\r\ndeclassification review.  Because NARA has no independent classification\r\nor declassification authority, we must consult with those agencies that\r\ncontrol the classified information in the documents.  Automatically\r\nsending all classified records for FOIA declassification review is not\r\nonly burdensome on NARA staff, but also often results in long delays and\r\nmulti-year backlogs at the agencies.  \r\n \r\nInstead, the library staff now create withdrawal sheets for the\r\nwithheld classified records so that requesters can choose whether to\r\nfile a mandatory declassification review (MDR) request or seek a\r\ndeclassification review under the existing FOIA request on the specific\r\nrecords that they are truly interested in.  We also inform requesters of\r\nthe differences between the appellate processes for MDR and FOIA review \u2013\r\nMDRs are appealed to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals\r\nPanel (ISCAP); FOIA requests can be appealed back to the agency and can\r\nthen be subject to judicial review.  \r\n \r\nWe believe that this approach is in the best interests of our\r\nrequesters, based on our long experience in this area.  Since this\r\nchange, almost all Presidential Library requestors now choose to file\r\nMDR requests rather than continue with the FOIA process.  \r\n \r\nNARA is always trying to refine and improve our responsiveness to FOIA\r\nrequests.  We try to communicate directly with the requesters, and\r\nencourage them to contact us if they have any questions or concerns\r\nabout what we are saying or doing.  We will also continuously evaluate\r\nwhether this approach is effective or can be improved upon.  We\r\napologize for any confusion we may have caused.  \r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nGary M. Stern\r\nGeneral Counsel and Chief FOIA Officer\r\nNational Archive and Records Administration\r\n ",

The denial, communicated in a letter dated November 8, 2023, from Jeremy Woods, Sr., Acting Disclosure Manager, cites FOIA exemption (b)(3) in conjunction with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) as the basis for withholding the requested records.\r\n\r\nGrounds for Appeal:\r\n\r\nMisapplication of Exemption (b)(3) and Rule 6(e): The IRS\u2019s reliance on exemption (b)(3) in conjunction with Rule 6(e) is overly broad. In McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court held that agencies must demonstrate that the records were matters occurring before the grand jury. The IRS has not provided specific evidence that all requested documents fall under this category.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Consideration: The IRS failed to consider the significant public interest in the disclosure of these records. In Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Supreme Court emphasized balancing public interest against potential harm. The Silk Road case is a matter of public concern, and disclosure would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government.\r\n\r\nSegregability Requirement: The IRS has not demonstrated that all portions of the requested documents are exempt from disclosure. As per Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242 (D.C. Cir. 1977), agencies are required to provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record after deleting the portions exempted from disclosure.\r\n\r\nRelief Sought:\r\n\r\nI respectfully request a review of the decision to deny my FOIA request. I ask that the IRS re-evaluate the applicability of exemption (b)(3) and Rule 6(e), consider the public interest in disclosure, and assess the possibility of releasing segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt response to my appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nEnclosures: Copy of original FOIA request, IRS denial letter\r\n\r\nCC: Jeremy Woods, Sr., Acting Disclosure Manager, IRS Disclosure Office 13",

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Jenny Wadhwa,\r\n\r\nThis email confirms receipt of your public record requests for reports pertaining to Nuisance Property Ordinance for the Gainesville Police Department.  In your request, you mentioned receiving police calls, reports, citations, etc.  Our agency does not handle police calls.  You will need to contact the Alachua County Combined Communication Center.  They can be reached at  audioproduction@alachuasheriff.org<mailto:audioproduction@alachuasheriff.org> or (352) 264-6688.\r\n\r\nIn regards to reports, I provided an excel spreadsheet of the case report numbers and charges.  Please be advised, there are over 300 arrest report numbers that are on this list.  It will take many hours to review and redact the arrest reports and incident reports.  We will need a deposit before we can begin the work.  Please advise if you are still interested in this request.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nVeronica L. Rochelle\r\nPolice Records Shift Supervisor\r\nGainesville Police Department\r\n(352) 393-7562",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for records related to the Fontana Police Department\u2019s purchase, usage, and policies regarding cellular communications interception technology (CCIT) and cell site simulators (CSS).\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 2023, the Fontana City Council approved the purchase of the Jacobs Technology Inc. Rapid Solutions system, which included the purchase and installation of a Base Station System for $920,098.94. The Rapid Solutions system qualifies as a CCIT and CSS. This purchase follows the acquisition of the Keyw CCIT/CSS systems; Keyw was acquired by Jacobs in 2019.\r\n\r\n1. Fontana Police Department's CCIT/CSS usage and privacy policy regarding the collection, use, maintenance, data retention, sharing, and dissemination of information, including all directives, bulletins, memoranda and related guidance;\r\n2. All memoranda of understanding or other agreements with other local agencies or any other party for the shared use of CCIT/CSS or the sharing of information collected through its use;\r\n3. All policies, guidance, training materials or other documents regarding the use of CCIT/CSS and compliance with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA); \r\n4. All disclosures to the California Department of Justice regarding CCIT/CSS use as required by CalECPA; \r\n5. All emails, documents, user manuals, marketing materials, presentations and other documentation describing the following Jacobs products: \r\n    a. Base Station NG;\r\n    b. Trachea2+;\r\n    c. Jugular4+;\r\n    d. Light Embedded Software System;\r\n6. All CCIT/CSS deployment logs from April 1, 2023 through March 19, 2024;\r\n7. All search warrants filed in relation to the use of CCIT/CSS from the period April 1, 2023 through March 19, 2024. \r\n\r\nIn addition we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n* Assistance in identifying additional records and information that describes Fontana\u2019s usage, acquisition of, and policies related to CCIT and CSS;\r\n* A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n* Suggestion for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at this email address. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWill Greenberg\r\nStaff Technologist\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Charles Grandison \"Charlie\" Rose III (August 10, 1939 \u2013 September 3, 2012), who was a Democratic United States Congressman from North Carolina who served from 1973 to 1997. Proof of death is not required as his death has been widely and extensively reported by the mainstream media, including the New York Times on September 4, 2012. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/charlie-rose-us-representative-dies-at-73.html Further, his death is reflected in the FBI's Dead List.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing the organization known as the Knights of\r\n    Columbus, a global Catholic fraternal service organization.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is March 2018.\r\n\r\nOur records reflect in April 2016, the negotiation analyst made two attempts to contact you regarding the option to potentially reduce the scope of your request in an effort to receive the records more quickly; no response was received at the time.  Please be advised reducing the scope of your request can accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please notify us in writing.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov> if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nElectronic FBI FOIPA request submissions are accepted at http://efoia.fbi.gov<http://efoia.fbi.gov/>.\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOIPA process?

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

Please see the original PRA request. Your form is not required and will not be completed.\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From: PRA Audit\r\n\r\n11/05/2021\r\nSubject: Washington Public Records Act Request: Bethel School District \u2013 Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including District Responses for the years 2010 - 2021\r\n\r\nEmail\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Bethel School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide these records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent records to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\"\r\n\r\n",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI do not know how to make this request more clear. \r\n\r\nYou have closed the request, opened the request, delayed the request, closed, opened, and then requested commercial purpose forms. You have demanded fees that do not seem to be based on actual agency costs and then ignored my inquiries about actual agency costs.  I too am quite confused as to where you are now with this request, however when we get to the end I will count up the entire production installments and if in sum total they match:\r\n\r\n\"a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Bethel School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"\r\n\r\nGREAT!\r\n\r\nif not,\r\n\r\nPROBLEM.\r\n\r\nThat should answer all the questions you could ever have about this request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n-Please get back to me with an answer about my email of 10-11-23 questions about actual agency costs.\r\n\r\n",
