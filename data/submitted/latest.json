Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

In the context of this, I hereby request that a copy of the following records and/or documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to Targeted Justice:\r\n\r\n1. All agreements, compacts, treaties, memoranda of understanding, and similar documents, that State Dept personnel have negotiated or signed with foreign governments or representatives thereof since 2003, that have the words, \"Science and Technology Cooperation,\" in the title, or similar wording.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored. The term \u201cdocument\u201d includes both the principal document responsive to the request as well as any studies, exhibits, supporting documentation or supplement thereof.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 713-306-8287. I will appreciate your prompt processing of this request as mandated by the FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWinter Owen Calvert\r\nMember, Board of Directors\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Burton Wallace Kanter (August 12, 1930 - October 31, 2001). Mr. Kanter was a Chicago-based tax lawyer and business partner of Paul L. E. Helliwell (100-347094), and throughout his career, he was associated with figures involved with organized crime like Morris \"Moe\" Dalitz (92-3068) and Morris Kleinman (92-5345). The Bureau investigated Mr. Kanter and his associates at various points between the 1960s and 1980s: Bureau file 92-HQ-5345 Serial 6 contains a report dated July 21, 1966, which details a trip taken by Mr. Kanter and Mr. Helliwell to Puerto Rico to meet with Mr. Kleinman about a business arrangement.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Kanter's privacy, as he passed away in 2001. A copy of his Chicago Tribune obituary, dated November 2, 2001, is attached.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of the Watergate investigation. Mr. Kanter and Mr. Helliwell were joint owners of a Bahamian offshore bank, the Castle Bank and Trust, that was featured in the Watergate Special Prosecution Task Force's investigation of financial connections between Howard Robard Hughes Jr., owner of the Hughes Tool Company and other businesses, and Charles Gregory \"Bebe\" Rebozo, an associate and financial advisor to former president Richard Nixon. Per records in the Hughes/Rebozo collection at the National Archives and Records Administration, the Bureau (along with the Internal Revenue Service) provided investigators with background information on the Castle Bank and Trust in the period of 1975.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Richard E. Gerstein (September 5, 1923 \u2013 April 26, 1992). Mr. Gerstein was a former District Attorney for Miami-Dade County. In 1972, Mr. Gerstein launched an investigation into the Watergate burglary which ultimately established a link between a $25,000 cashier's check from Richard Nixon's Committee to Re-Elect the President and Watergate plumber Bernard Barker. It was this investigation that led to FBI Deputy Director W. Mark Felt initiating an FBI investigation into Mr. Gerstein. Per a 2005 article from The Nation titled \"How Deep Throat Fooled the FBI\":\r\n\r\n\"In the September 11, 1972, memo, Felt noted that the county prosecutor in Miami, Richard Gerstein, might be the [Washington] Post\u2018s main source. Gerstein was investigating how a $25,000 check from Nixon\u2019s campaign had ended up in the account of a Watergate burglar. Felt wrote: 'It appears that much of the information which has been leaked to the press may have come from [Dade] County Prosecutor Gerstein in Florida.' To search for the Post\u2019s leaker(s), Felt instructed the FBI\u2019s Special Agent-in-Charge (SAC) in Miami to interview every FBI official who had been in contact with Gerstein. Felt also expressed concern in the memo that the Post reporters had obtained information directly from an FBI report (called a '302') based on an official interview with a Watergate conspirator. Felt wrote, 'I personally contacted [Washington] SAC [Robert] Kunkel [who was supervising the agents probing Watergate] to point out that it appeared the Washington Post or at least a reporter had access to the\u2026302. I told him he should forcibly remind all agents of the need to be most circumspect in talking about this case with anyone outside the Bureau.' \"\r\n\r\nThat article can be found here: https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-deep-throat-fooled-fbi/\r\n\r\nMr. Felt would later admit to Vanity Fair magazine that he was responsible for the Washington Post leaks he accused Mr. Gerstein of in 1972. Any records the FBI may have created in the course of its investigation into Mr. Gerstein's activities respective to Watergate are of immense public interest, given that an FBI official launched an investigation into a public official under false pretenses.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Bureau conducted at least one other investigation into Mr. Gerstein, during the course of a separation investigation into Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Donald Crichton Alexander. A December 23, 1975 memo from the Special Agent-in-Charge of the Washington Field Office reads: \"INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED BY WFO ON DECEMBER 3, 1975 THAT [redacted], FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, MIAMI, FLORIDA (ASSIGNED TO STRIKE FORCE IN MIAMI) HAS AN INFORMANT WHO IS CLOSE TO RICHARD GERSTEIN, DADE COUNTY PROSECUTOR [redacted]. MIAMI WILL LOCATE AND INTERVIEW [redacted] REGARDING ANY INFORMATION HE HAS CONCERNING THIS MATTER AND DURING INTERVIEW WILL ASCERTAIN IF INFORMANT WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) INTERVIEW. NO ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW WITHOUT NOTIFYING WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE FIRST.\"\r\n\r\nThe December 23rd memo is included with records released by the FBI to website The Black Vault in 2019 and can be found on pages 125 and 126 of the released file: https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/fbifiles/politicians/donaldalexander-fbi1.pdf\r\n\r\nThe Alexander investigation was connected to an IRS investigation known as Operation Leprechaun, wherein the IRS's Intelligence Division carried out covert surveillance of public officials. FBI knowledge of Leprechaun is confirmed in another memo in IRS Commissioner Alexander's FBI file, this time dated November 28, 1975: \"GERSTEIN IS THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BY THE INTELLIGENCE DIVISION OF THE IRS IN MIAMI ... THE ORIGINAL OPERATION LEPRECHAUN ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE SOME TIME IN MARCH 1975...\"\r\n\r\nThe November 28th memo is included with records released by the FBI to website The Black Vault in 2019 and can be found on pages pages 166 and 167 of the released file: https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/fbifiles/politicians/donaldalexander-fbi1.pdf\r\n\r\nThe November 28th memo makes reference to Mr. Gerinstein possibly using an emissary to communicate with an outside party, believed to be Cincinnati Republican County Chairman Ambrose Lindhorst\u2014a one-time partner in IRS Commissioner Alexander's law firm. The language in this memo is clear and indicates the FBI was carrying out its own criminal investigation into Mr. Gerstein. Any records the FBI may have created in the course of its investigation into Mr. Gerstein respective to IRS Commissioner Alexander or any other parties are of immense public interest, given the FBI's prior investigation of Mr. Gerstein connected to Watergate.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of the Watergate and Leprechaun investigations. Examples have been listed above.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Gerstein's privacy, as he passed away in 1992. A copy of his New York Times obituary, dated April 27, 1992, can be found on the Times' website: https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/us/richard-e-gerstein-dead-at-68-prosecuted-key-watergate-figure.html\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

All documents showing that Mr. Kable had the legal authority to negotiate and/or execute Treaties, memoranda of understanding and/or agreements on behalf of the U.S. Government with foreign governments.\r\n2. Documents showing that the U.S. Senate approved the agreement negotiated and signed by Charles Kable with the Interior Minister of Croatia. \r\n3. All agreements, compacts, treaties, memoranda of understanding, and similar documents, that FBI officials or officers have negotiated or signed with foreign governments or representatives thereof since 2003.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored. The term \u201cdocument\u201d includes both the principal document responsive to the request as well as any studies, exhibits, supporting documentation or supplement thereof.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 713-306-8287. I will appreciate your prompt  processing of this request as mandated by the FOIA.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWinter Owen Calvert\r\nMember, Board of Directors\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O.

Your request is still considered open.\u00a0 Any request for \"any and all\" public records, or a request that contains a request for any potentially associated e-mails, correspondence, or the coordination with more than one City department must be handled by their office. We do not conduct e-mail searches in Police Records, nor do we coordinate multi-layered requests. The Bellevue Police Department does not manage the City of Bellevue's traffic cameras, so any request for traffic camera footage should be made through the City Clerk's Office, as well. \r\nThe City Clerk\u2019s Office will be your point of contact for this request moving forward. Your assigned Police Department reference number will be closed and your new reference number from the City Clerk's Office is C000658-080824.\u00a0 You should anticipate a response from their office by 08/15/24. \r\nIf you have any questions about this process, you may contact the Police Records Unit via the Public Records Portal or by telephone at (425) 452-6917. You may reach the City Clerk\u2019s Office at PublicRecords@bellevuewa.gov. \r\nThank you, \r\nAngel Francois \r\nBellevue Police Department",
