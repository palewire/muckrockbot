The agency tracking number is FA-24-0037.  Under the FOIA, your request is in the \u201ceducational/news media\u201d fee category. This category grants the requester the first 100 duplicated pages, along with search and review time, free of charge. Thereafter you would be responsible for duplication costs associated with the processing of your request (duplication costs include time spent converting electronic files to non-editable format). However, the fee waiver that you filed has been accepted and as such you will not be charged any fees for the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Due to the current coronavirus pandemic, the Omaha District is experiencing delays in our ability to process FOIA requests. Because our office currently has a backlog of requests, your request will be placed on a calendar/tracking system behind others received before it, and each is processed in the order it was received.

The College received your letter on Monday, March 17, 2025, after returning from spring break closure. Your request has been forwarded to College departments that may have existing records that are responsive to your request. Please be advised that the Maryland Public Information Act does not require the College to answer informational questions or create new records to satisfy your request. Please be further advised that the College charges fees for the completion of such requests if it takes more than two hours of staff time to fulfill. At this moment, I have asked for an estimated time amount from the departments who may have access to responsive documents, as your request is extensive and I believe it will take more than two hours to fulfill. Once I have their responses, I will provide you with an estimated fee, at which point you may let me know if you wish the College to proceed with gathering the documents.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJustin Douds, J.D.\r\nHe/Him/His\r\n\r\nVice President, Policy and General Counsel\r\n301-546-PGCC (7422) - ext. 60590\r\nPrince George's Community College - 301 Largo Road, Largo, MD 20774\r\nwww.PGCC.edu<http://www.pgcc.edu/>\r\n\r\n[1D64DA1E]\r\n\r\nNOTICE OF CONFIDENTIALITY: This email, and any attachments thereto, is intended for use only by the addressee(s) named herein and may contain confidential information, legally privileged information and attorney-client work product.

        "communication": "Good Afternoon,\r\n\r\nThis email is once again intended for Alisia Rios, Data Analyst at Evergreen Solutions, LLC.\r\n\r\nMs. Rios, on March 19, 2025, I notified you that Prince George's Community College (the College) had received your extensive MPIA request upon return from its spring break on March 17, 2025. I advised that I had asked the departments who may have access to responsive documents for an estimated time for their efforts, and noted that the College charges fees for all time expended beyond the first two hours.  PGCC's MPIA fee schedule (and other FAQs about PGCC's MPIA processing) can be found at this link: https://www.pgcc.edu/about-pgcc/institutional-information--policies/maryland-public-information-act-mpia-requests/.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the College estimates that it will take 2 employees 8 hours each to fulfill the request, with one employee researching the faculty and staff census information, and the other gathering documents listed at the bottom of the request. Based on salary, one employee's hourly compensation is $57.27, and the other's hourly compensation is $61.25. Thus, PGCC estimates that you would be charged $711.12 for the production of records to fulfill your request ($57.27 x 6 additional hours PLUS $61.25 x 6 additional hours). Because the information would be provided electronically, you would not be charged any additional fees for the production of records in a type of medium (CD, photographs, etc.). Please note that this is an estimate, and the actual fee for the collection of records pursuant to this request may be fewer or greater than $711.12\r\n\r\nUnder the MPIA, you may seek a fee waiver if 1) you are indigent or 2) you believe a waiver would be in the public interest.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm whether you still wish to receive the information. If so, we will gather the information and provide you with the actual fee amount, and connect you with the Bursar's office for collection of payment prior to releasing the information.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\nJustin Douds, J.D.\r\nHe/Him/His\r\n\r\nVice President, Policy and General Counsel\r\n301-546-PGCC (7422) - ext. 60590\r\nPrince George's Community College - 301 Largo Road, Largo, MD 20774\r\nwww.PGCC.edu<http://www.pgcc.edu/>\r\n\r\n[1D64DA1E]\r\n\r\nNOTICE OF CONFIDENTIALITY: This email, and any attachments thereto, is intended for use only by the addressee(s) named herein and may contain confidential information, legally privileged information and attorney-client work product.

In the past, we've had experiences with other organizations where, unfortunately, we completed payment but did not receive all of the requested data.\r\n\r\nTo avoid any confusion or delays, would it be possible for you to provide a brief summary of the materials being sent? This will help us ensure everything is accounted for prior to payment.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here is an example of the type of summary we\u2019re looking for:\r\n\r\n1. Staff Census\r\n(Includes job classification, FTE status, pay ranges, and salary grades)\r\n\r\n2. Staff Handbook\r\n(Employee policies, code of conduct, benefits, and general procedures)\r\n\r\n3.

Therefore, I ask that my request is expedited. When completing this request, please prioritize whichever records would take the least amount of time to be located and released. I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method, and again, please release documents on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a reporter for Business Insider, and the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and if there are any questions about my request, can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me at email address. I am also happy to hop on the phone.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your reply within 20 business days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline",

        "communication": "Dear SB1421 Requesters and interested parties,\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the City of Fullerton has broken California\u2019s Public Record\u2019s Law, specifically related to SB1421, by denying you records which are quite clearly publicly disclosable.\r\n\r\nIn the link sent to you by Mea Klein, Assistant City Clerk, as provided to her by the City Attorney, you were told that there are 27 Officers \"REQUESTED BY NAME, BUT NO DISCLOSABLE FILE AVAILABLE (27)\u201d. This is patently false.\r\n\r\nThe City of Fullerton is currently suing me, my compatriot David and the blog Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future directly related to the findings on several of these officers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/>\r\n\r\nIn looking at this list I can quite easily name Officers on that list who have disclosable records under SB1421 including but not limited to Kathryn Hamel, Paul Irish, Miguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo, Christopher Wren & Nathan Roesler.\r\n\r\nA sustained finding was found against Hamel and one cannot simply unring that bell as seen in the recent Contra Costa County tentative decision (CASE NAME: RICHMOND POLICE VS. CITY OF RICHMOND <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Contra-Costa-Ruling-Case-MSN19-0169-2020-07-31.pdf>). \r\n\r\nThis FFFF article related to Hamel is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/>\r\n\r\nChristopher Wren had a sustained finding against for dishonesty related to a workplace affair with a subordinate. In IA Case #17-0038 one of the sustained findings against Officer Wren is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201c6. On December 17, 2017, when Lieutenant Cleggett asked you about your whereabouts, you dishonestly stated to Lieutenant Cleggett that you had been on the phone with your wife the entire time and did not notice Lieutenant Cleggett\u2019s text message.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement of dishonesty was directly related to misconduct as outlined in the timeline of Wren\u2019s activities and being in violation of policy. \r\n\r\nLikewise with Christopher Wren, this article is specifically listed in the lawsuit being waged against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/what-happened-to-officer-christopher-wren/\r\n\r\nThe idea that the city attorney is unaware of the sustained findings against their officers which are disclosable under SB1421 is laughable when those very stories are being used by the same attorneys as evidence in a lawsuit where the city seeks a prior restraint against myself and FFFF.\r\n\r\nThe blog has likewise published stories on how Paul Irish was terminated for dishonesty;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/>\r\n\r\nMiguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo admitted in the plea deal that he both used excessive force and falsified a police report.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/>\r\n\r\nNathan Roesler filed a false report with the City of Placentia which resulted in an innocent man being arrested for a crime that wasn\u2019t committed against Roesler. This was referred to the District Attorney for prosecution.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/>\r\n\r\nThese are the cases which are readily and easily pointed out which I believe to be disclosable under SB1421 which calls all of the other officers on the list into question. The City is blatantly lying to you, your organizations and agencies as well as the public and concerned entities about disclosable records despite being in a separate lawsuit over these very violations of SB1421.\r\n\r\nThey are likewise violating the law in regards to the officer whose records are \"PENDING; NOT YET PRODUCED (3)\u201d. The incident in Corbett\u2019s case was from 2016 and Paez\u2019s was in 2017. The timeline has long passed for required production in both of these cases.\r\n\r\nIf you are honestly seeking these records and others from the City of Fullerton you will likely have no recourse but to seek remedies in order to get to the truth. I have already been forced to take this route unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I wish you all the best in your efforts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Ferguson\r\nHost, The Hourly Struggle\r\nWriter, Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future\r\nConcerned Citizen\n",

        "communication": "Dear SB 1421 requesters and interested parties:\r\nYou have each recently received a mass email communication from an individual with whom the City of Fullerton is currently engaged in civil litigation, Joshua Ferguson.  The email contained inaccuracies about the City's responses to Public Records requests.  The City would like to correct certain information and assure you and other members of the public of its commitment to transparency and compliance with legal requirements for the disclosure of public records, including certain peace officer records recently made public under SB 1421, which is codified at Penal Code section 832.7.  Of course, the City cannot respond as to any specifics about any individual officers referenced, due to privacy.\r\n\r\nDisclosable use of force files:\r\nNot all use of force investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of those files involving uses of force that have resulted in death or \"great bodily injury.\"  Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \"Great bodily injury\" means \"significant or substantial physical injury.\"  Pen. Code section 16600.  Examples of \"great bodily injury\" include: broken bones, People v. Villarreal (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1141; gunshot wounds, People v. Mendias (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 195; and a dog bite, People v. Frazier (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 613, 618.  SB 1421 also mandates the disclosure of investigation files involving a peace officer or custodial officer's discharge of a firearm at a civilian.  See Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nDisclosable dishonesty files:\r\nNot all dishonesty investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of \"sustained finding[s] . . . [of] dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.\"  See Cal. Penal Code section 832.7(b)(1)(C) (emphasis added).\r\nThe Legislature intended to provide the public access to cases involving dishonesty, where an officer \"is proven to have planted evidence, committed perjury, or otherwise been dishonest in the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime.\"  Assembly Committee on Public Safety, Analysis of SB 1421 (June 26, 2018).\r\n\r\nIn order for acts of dishonesty to be disclosable under SB 1421, there must also have been a \"sustained\" finding of dishonesty.  A \"sustained finding\" is defined as \"a final determination by an investigating agency, commission, board, hearing officer, or arbitrator, as applicable, following an investigation and opportunity for an administrative appeal pursuant to Sections 3304 and 3304.5 of the Government Code, that the actions of the peace officer or custodial officer were found to violate law or department policy.\"  Pen. Code section 832.8 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIf an officer investigated for the type dishonesty or sexual assault that is disclosable under SB 1421 resigns prior to a sustained finding, his or her file is not disclosable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the email that you received referred to a specific court ruling (Richmond Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of Richmond), that ruling was only tentative (not final) and was only the ruling of one Superior Court Judge in Contra Costa County.  The City of Fullerton is located in Orange County, and is not subject to those courts or their rulings.  However, even a ruling in Orange County would not have been determinative, as facts in different cases may lead to different results, and a single judge's opinion is not required to be followed by other judges, until there is some binding opinion of higher courts.  In fact, in City of Richmond, that court found that the employer and an officer could not reverse sustained findings of dishonesty or sexual assault through a negotiated settlement, after the conclusion of a formal hearing process.  In circumstances where a final, formal hearing has not been held, the court acknowledged that there would be no \"sustained findings\" and hence such records are \"not disclosable under SB 1421.\"  (The City of Richmond court also noted that investigations of dishonesty involving subjects not specifically listed in Penal Code section 832.7 are also not disclosable).\r\n\r\nRegardless of the inapplicability of the City of Richmond opinion in Orange County, the City of Fullerton's disclosure of its records under SB 1421 does follow the same principles.\r\n\r\nThe City is committed to providing all records that it is required and permitted to release to the public relating to peace officers.  It has been working hard to review and release all records newly made releasable since the enactment of SB 1421, and will continue to do so. The City has produced 26 SB 1421 files; has partially produced 13 additional SB 1421 files; and has 2 SB 1421 files pending review (one of which awaits resolution of administrative or other proceedings).  The City's SB 1421 productions are available at www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421<http://www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421>, and a copy of the summary chart detailing the progress of the City's SB 1421 review and production is posted therein.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your requests or the City's production thereto, please contact the City Clerk's Office or the City Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nKimberly Hall Barlow\r\nJones & Mayer\r\n3777 N.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\nDear Elijah Pittman, Thank you for speaking with me today. You clarified your request indicating that you are in possession of photos of the vehicle that is the subject of your request-- a DC Department of Transportation vehicle. This letter acknowledges and responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request #R012258-070125 to the DC Department of Public Works (DPW).\u00a0You requested the following records: \u201cInformation including but not limited to documents like registration reports, procurement agreements, contracts, about D.C. government owned and operated Rivian vehicle with number \"98 16037\" and Washington, D.C. license plate number \"DC 16037\" used for. I also request documents pertaining to the purchasing and maintenance of Rivian vehicles and any documents containing the number of total Rivian vehicles in the D.C. fleet.\u201d DPW provides municipal services in two distinct program areas: solid waste management and parking enforcement. Both contribute to making District streets and public spaces clean, safe, attractive, and accessible. DPW's Solid Waste Management Administration performs a number of daily operations including trash and recycling collection, sanitation education and enforcement, graffiti removal, public litter can service, fall leaf collection, and street and alley cleaning. DPW's Parking Enforcement Management Administration enforces the District's on-street parking laws. Approximately 200 parking officers monitor 17,000 meters and 3,500 blocks of residential zoned parking. In addition to routine enforcement, the Parking Enforcement Management Administration is charged with booting and towing operations and with removing abandoned and dangerous vehicles from public and private property. Behind the scenes, DPW's Fleet Management Administration supports municipal operations by procuring, fueling, and maintaining thousands of District government vehicles, from sedans to heavy equipment. Some vehicles are managed and maintained independently by certain agencies. Fleet Management also is responsible for purchasing environmentally friendly, alternative-fuel vehicles (AFV) for the city. Please be advised that DPW maintains information partially responsive to your request. Specifically, DPW is aware of fifty-six (56) Rivian vehicles within the District\u2019s fleet. However, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation manages and maintains all the vehicles. Your FOIA requests concerning procurement agreements and contracts should be submitted to the DC Office of Procurement, FOIA Officer Jeremiah Regan, 441 4th Street NW, Washington, DC 20001, email: jeremiah.regan@dc.gov , phone: (202) 727-0252. Your FOIA requests related to vehicle registrations should be sent to DC Department of Motor Vehicles Pamela Washington, Assistant General Counsel, District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles, 95 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20024-3622, phone (202) 729-7113; email: pamela.washington@dc.gov. (mailto:pamela.washington@dc.gov) Your requests related to maintenance should be sent to Nana Bailey-Thomas, Esq., Hearings/FOIA Officer, Office of the General Counsel, at the District Department of Transportation, 250 M Street, S.E., Suite 800, Washington, D.C. 20003; phone: (202) 673-6811; Email: nana.bailey@dc.gov. (mailto:nana.bailey@dc.gov) Therefore, FOIA request #R012258-070125 is . GRANTED IN PART Please note, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you have the right to appeal this response to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d or \u201cFOIA Appeal\u201d in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope. The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, and e-mail and/or U.S. Mail address at which you can be reached. The appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor\u2019s Correspondence Unit, FOIA Appeal; 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 316, Washington, D.C. 20004. Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor\u2019s Correspondence Unit at foia.mayor@dc.gov Further, you must forward a copy of all appeal materials to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency or to the agency head if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer.\u00a0\u00a0Failure to follow these administrative steps will delay the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal.

Your request was received in this office on 5/11/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.If you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-25563.

        "communication": "Andrew Free \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR145669 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2023-ICFO-25563 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 5/11/2023.  You have requested all records pertaining to 2022-ICAP-01053 and 2021-ICFO-04070. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request produced 44 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 44 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMegan Davis \r\nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\t45 Pages \r\nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. \r\nRESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed your request and determined that, as currently written, it is unduly burdensome beyond the public interest. The CPS FOIA Office has conducted a preliminary e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request, which yielded 1,774 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Special Assistant to the CEO\u2019s email account without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line and sender and recipient lines are extremely likely to contain student and personal email addresses, identities of parents communicating with their child\u2019s school, details pertaining to pending investigatory, predecisional, or attorney client privileged matters, and other student information which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the 1,774 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, reviewing the requested records would require numerous staff hours and therefore, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This is not a denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow this request, you may to specify keywords or a subject matter for which you seek records, modify the request to seek a log of emails between Ms. Hernandez and other specified individuals, and/or limit the timeframe of the search. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

The CPS FOIA Office has conducted an e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in the narrowed request, which yielded over 1,400 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Special Assistant to the CEO\u2019s email account without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line and sender and recipient lines are likely to contain student email addresses, personal email addresses, and identities of parents communicating with their child\u2019s school district within messages sent to Ms. Hernandez at her @cps.edu email address, details pertaining to pending investigatory, predecisional, or attorney client privileged matters, and other student information or collective bargaining information which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the more than 1,400 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, reviewing the requested records would require numerous staff hours and the dedication of staff and/or resources remains unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This request has not been appreciably narrowed and is therefore denied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g). You have the right to challenge this denial and/or submit a new request. Any new request will be subject to the FOIA. The CPS FOIA Department considers this request closed. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (employee ID numbers, personal email addresses, personal phone numbers, medical information, birthdates, etc.) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student/parent information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d).

Good afternoon Wendy Sawyer, A search has been completed for the following information: the exact number of people who are, 1) on both the sex offender registry and probation; and 2) on both the sex offender registry and parole. As I stated in my prior communication to you, DOC does not maintain the Sex Offender Registry, Connecticut State Police does.\u00a0 With that being said, I reached out to staff for any records or information responsive to your request, and they were able to provide the below information. As of 7/15/2025 the number of offenders on parole who are also on the sex offender registry is 343. Please note that the Department of Correction would not have any information on the number of individuals on the sex offender registry and probation, as probation is overseen by the Judicial Branch - Court Support Services Division (CSSD). Thank you for your time and attention and please feel free to reach out with any questions or issues. Sincerely, Stephanie Secore \r\nFOI Administrator \r\nCentral Office FOI Unit",

This department is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three-business-day period. \u00a7 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n \r\nEstimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within seven business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. We will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within seven business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than seven business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. \r\n \r\nBilling: \r\nThis department will charge fees for copies and research time required for fulfilling records requests at the actual cost of research time. \u00a7 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items.\" Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. \r\n \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. This department will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. \u00a7 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\n \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. \r\n  \n Thank you,  \r\n  \r\n Saint Charles Police Department \r\n1781 Zumbehl Road\r\nSaint Charles, MO 63303 \r\n(636) 940-4619",

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing.

Once the volume of documents has been determined, we will reach out to better target your request so we may process it in the most efficient and expeditious manner possible. \n\n[x ]  Records responsive to your request have been identified and we are currently conducting our review.  You will be notified when your records are ready for release. \n\n[ ]  We would like to update you that your request has moved to the next stage in processing and records are currently being reviewed by our component offices.

        "communication": "Subject: ALPR Audit Reports Review by Chief of Police Schenita Stewart\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request records related to the Evanston Police Department\u2019s (EPD) use of Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) technology. This request is based on a recent communication from Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police regarding state surveillance and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ensure compliance with the Welcoming City Ordinance and protect community trust, I have assigned a dedicated supervisor to oversee all aspects of ALPR usage within EPD. Furthermore, we conduct regular organizational and network audits, which I personally review. EPD also operates under a clear and established policy governing ALPR use, reinforcing both accountability and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the City of Evanston's website page on the \"Welcoming City Ordinance\" (Ordinance 17-O-25):\r\n\r\n\"Key updates to the Ordinance include:\r\n\r\nData Protection: Prohibiting the sharing of city databases or information with federal immigration agencies, or with third parties unless they certify against its use for civil immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nExpanded Safeguards: Clarifying that City officials will not participate in civil immigration enforcement by any agency or personnel, including private contractors. The City will continue to comply with a valid criminal warrant.\r\n\r\nClosing Loopholes: Strengthening policies to eliminate exceptions that previously allowed limited City involvement in immigration enforcement under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nSupport for Immigrants: Codifying practices that assist crime victims in obtaining specific visas and providing immigration resource information through public services like 311.\r\n\r\nSafe Public Buildings: The City is now tasked with developing policies for its public facilities that prioritize limiting immigration enforcement operations on their premises to the fullest extent allowed by law.\"\r\n\r\nIn light of this statement made by Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police, along with the updates to Evanston's Welcoming City Ordinance, and in accordance with Illinois law (625 ILCS 5/2-130), which prohibits sharing automated license plate reader ALPR data with out-of-state agencies for purposes such as interfering with reproductive health access or enforcing immigration laws, I request full transparency for the following:\r\n\r\n1) Any records showing review or oversight of Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR Organization or Network audit reports by the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart from January 1, 2024, to the present - including emails, memos, meeting notes, audit summaries, annotations, or briefings demonstrating the Stewart\u2019s direct involvement in reviewing audit data.\r\n\r\n2) Any communications between the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart and Evanston Police Department supervisors or Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR administrators regarding network audit findings that raised questions or concerns, including but not limited to:\r\n    a) Access by out-of-state agencies (e.g., AL, FL, IN, KY, MO, NC, TX, etc) \r\n    b) Federal agency involvement (e.g., DHS, HSI, ICE, CBP, etc)\r\n    c) References to abortion or reproductive health care (e.g., abortion, women, woman, pregnant, pp, planned parenthood, etc)\r\n    d) References to immigration enforcement (e.g., immigration, border patrol, 287g, etc)\r\n    e) Search reasons lacking case numbers or specific descriptions (e.g., inv, p, m, zz, training, test, ab501, invest, narcotics, drugs, 123abv, etc)\r\n\r\n3) Any internal protocols or policies that describe the role of the Evanston Police Department\u2019s chief or supervisors in reviewing Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR audits and identifying potentially inappropriate use, particularly regarding compliance with Illinois statutes and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNiles Coalition",
