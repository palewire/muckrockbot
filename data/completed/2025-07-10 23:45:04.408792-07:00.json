        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nA copy of the historical study Office of Personnel: The Position Management and Compensation Division, 1946-1967.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\n1. The specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

(Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.000.) The public interest must be weighed whether such disclosure \u201cwould contribute significantly to public understanding of government activities\u201d and serve the legislative purpose of \u2018\u2018shed[ding] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties.\u2019\u2019 ( City of San Jose v. Superior Court\u00a0(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1019.) Here, disclosure of this record would not significantly contribute to an understanding of the City\u2019s performance or duties. Moreover, the release of this information could result in the misuse of documents intended for sensitive public safety incidences.\u00a0 For these reasons, in weighing the public interest, the City finds that the public interest served by nondisclosure of these types of records outweighs the public interest served by disclosure. \r\nSincerely, \r\nDoberne #3797 \r\nPolice Records Supervisor \r\nSanta Monica Police Records",

Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $80 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2014 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefor.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",

A comparable request submitted recently to another regional law enforcement agency was processed with a significantly shorter timeline and a projected fulfillment date of May 27, 2025. This suggests that the records I\u2019ve requested\u2014 which are routinely maintained by public agencies\u2014 may be reasonably accessible without requiring such an extended delay.\r\n\r\nI understand that some of the materials may require review or redaction. However, under RCW 42.56.520, agencies are required to provide the \u201creasonable estimate\u201d of time necessary to produce records, and I respectfully ask for more detail as to what is contributing to this 60-business-day estimate.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I also request that responsive records be released on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than in a single, delayed release. I am open to narrowing or prioritizing specific sections of my request to assist in timely fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and attention. I look forward to your response and hope to work collaboratively to ensure the timely release of these important public records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAurora Quinn",

Salary Records: Current and historical salary data for all personnel, including base pay, overtime, special assignment pay, and bonuses. \r\nI will be coordinating your records request with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). My apologies for the very long estimate that was initially sent to you. I was out of town and one of the records staff at JCSO sent that estimate based on their perception of the size of your request. We do actually intend to produce records by installment as records are located, compiled and review is completed. A few of your request items are relatively simple and can correspondingly be produced relatively quickly. However, unless I'm misunderstanding any details, the overall scope of your request appears to be massive. I have taken the liberty of numbering each of the bulleted items in your request, for ease of reference. I would guess that 27 of your requests, taken together, comprise a significant portion, probably a majority, of all of JCSO's administrative records. Many of the requested records will require detailed review and redaction which is a time-consuming process. Some of the requested records will also require third party notice to be sent to subjects of the records, which will also add to the overall processing time for those records. Given limitations in personnel and the need to prevent excessive interference with other essential operations, it will take a period of many months to complete all 27 items of your request. But, as I mentioned, we will produce records by installment as they are compiled, prepared and reviewed. Some of the records you are requesting exist in paper files only. The county charges 10 cents a page for scans of paper records, so there will be some charges for certain installments along the way. The total cost of all charges will almost certainly be well in excess of $25. Each time we anticipate charges for a certain installment, we will first send you an estimate of the charges, showing an estimate of the number of pages to be scanned. We estimate that public records responsive to this request will be available within nine business days from today, on or before 5/30/2025. If public records become available in advance of this estimate we will contact you promptly. Conversely, if the County encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will contact you promptly with a revised estimated date. Thank you for your patience in awaiting this information.

To that end, I would be happy to work with you to identify an initial set of 10\u201315 high-priority categories that can be compiled and released earlier in the process. If you could advise which of the requested items are more readily accessible or less resource-intensive to produce, that would help me focus the request accordingly. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide a simple tracking update or log indicating the current status of each category as they move through review and preparation. This would help me monitor progress and plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your willingness to produce records on a rolling basis and for providing advance estimates of any anticipated charges. I look forward to receiving the first installment of records by May 30, 2025, or sooner if available, and to working collaboratively toward a transparent and timely resolution.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAurora Quinn",

All of the records produced for an item will be stored in that item's sub-request and provided via the sub-request. Also all communication regarding each item, including time estimates for providing installments of records can also be conducted via the corresponding sub-request.

Before proceeding with payment or next steps, I would like to take time to refine the scope of the requested records to ensure clarity and reduce unnecessary time and cost for both parties.\r\n\r\nI am currently reviewing the following 27 requested items and will be preparing a refined, tiered list identifying:\r\n\u2022\tWhich items apply to current employees only vs. former employees (and how many years back, e.g., last 3\u201310 years),\r\n\u2022\tWhich apply specifically to sworn officers vs. administrative staff,\r\n\u2022\tWhich categories should be prioritized first for delivery.\r\n\r\nI also acknowledge that you have already provided:\r\n\u2022\tThe personnel roster of current employees (Item #1) via the Muckrock portal,\r\n\u2022\tA formal response indicating no responsive records for Item #10 (Early Intervention System Data),\r\n\u2022\tA formal response indicating no responsive records for Item #20 (Body-Worn Camera Misuse or Policy Violations).\r\n\r\nWhile I reserve the right to revisit these items or seek administrative appeal later, if necessary, I will focus for now on refining the scope of the remaining requests. Please also note that I intend to process all communications and records delivery solely through the Muckrock portal to keep everything centralized. Once I finalize and submit the refined list, I will follow up regarding payment arrangements and next steps.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation.

The Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (PAO) provided two versions of their Brady list. The list in PDF format is the currently used list which is more up to date. The Excel spreadsheet version is the previously-used version which is no longer kept up to date, but it contains some information that is not included in the current list. The PAO issues potential impeachment disclosure (PID)\u00a0letters pertaining to both Jefferson County Sheriff officers and Port Townsend Police Department officers, so those are included in the responsive records. Please log in at the following link to retrieve your responsive records: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003642-052225  These may be all of the responsive records, but it appears that there is at least one PID letter missing. I will need to inquire with the PAO regarding any remaining unlocated records. Meanwhile, if you have any additional questions or issues pertaining to the records produced in this installment, please don't hesitate to contact me. If any additional records are located, we estimate the next installment to this request will be available within five\u00a0business days from today, on or before 7/11/2025. If you experience any difficulties accessing the Public Records Center or downloading your documents, please contact me as soon as possible for assistance.

Dear Aurora  Quinn, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office received the following public records request from you on April 30, 2025: (3) Internal Affairs Complaints Logs \r\nPlease provide logs or records of complaints filed against sworn officers from January 1, 2015 to the present, including: \r\n* Date of complaint \r\n* Name(s) of officer(s) involved \r\n* Badge number(s) \r\n* Nature/type of complaint \r\n* Summary of allegations \r\n* Status and outcome \r\n* Date investigation closed \r\n* Disciplinary action taken (if any) \r\nIn response to your records request, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has provided the full internal affairs log that is maintained by their office. The log includes all types of internal affairs incidents combined in one table. In addition to complaints the log includes use of force incidents, pursuits, workplace injuries and equipment/vehicle damage incidents. The log does not include: \r\nBadge number \r\nDate investigation closed The disposition column contains a small amount of information about disciplinary action taken for investigations that were upheld, but the information doesn't appear to be entirely consistent. For current employees, badge numbers can be located by cross-referencing employee names from the IA log with names in the current employee roster, which I've included in the downloads with the IA log file. Since the records of all investigations will be provided to you in response to other items in your overall records request, those documents will include all the details of the investigations, including the date that the investigations were closed and any disciplinary action that was taken. Please log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve your responsive documents: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003640-052225  All responsive records have been produced and the request is now closed. This completes, closes, and provides Jefferson County's final, definitive response to this request. If you have any difficulty retrieving your documents, please contact me for assistance as soon as possible. Jefferson County will take no further action on this request. If you have questions regarding the processing of this request or would like to initiate an administrative appeal regarding the response to your request, please do so at your earliest opportunity.\u00a0You may also seek judicial review of our response to your request for a period of one year, beginning as of the date of this message, consistent with RCW 42.56.550.

It does not include all of the information you've requested. There is no summary-type of information (such as would be included in a spreadsheet) regarding disciplinary or investigation findings related to employee separations. The most concise responsive records for that would be any investigation reports related to separations. Those reports would also be responsive to item #14, so we can provide them in response to item 2 or item 14, or both. Please let me know your preference. Once I receive a reply from you I can update you on the status of both items. The spreadsheet we provided does not include badge numbers. Badge numbers assigned to former employees are eligible for reuse and can be assigned to new employees. The Jefferson County sheriff's office does not maintain an updated list of badge numbers of former employees. Please log in at the following link to retrieve your responsive records: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003656-052925  Sincerely, Ken Hugoniot \r\nPublic Records Administrator \r\nCentral Services \r\nJefferson County \r\n360-385-9174",

A key question is whether such programs operate independently or in concert with disciplinary enforcement.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request the following records from the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners (or LLR) for the period 2019\u20132024:\r\n\r\n1. A list of disciplinary actions involving physicians where:\r\n\r\nPsychological or psychiatric impairment was cited\r\n\r\nSubstance use or behavioral health concerns were involved\r\n\r\n2. Board or departmental policies or procedures regarding:\r\n\r\nReferrals to the South Carolina Recovering Professional Program (RPP)\r\n\r\nEvaluation of return-to-practice after monitoring or treatment\r\n\r\n3. Agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding between the board and RPP, including:\r\n\r\nConfidentiality provisions\r\n\r\nReporting requirements\r\n\r\nCriteria for board acceptance or rejection of RPP recommendations\r\n\r\n4. Summary statistics or internal reports showing:\r\n\r\nNumber of referrals to RPP\r\n\r\nVoluntary vs. mandated participation\r\n\r\nReturn-to-practice outcomes\r\n\r\nAny cases where the board diverged from RPP recommendations\r\n\r\n5. Evaluations or audits (internal or external) assessing RPP\u2019s independence or effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nVig Sinclair",

This may also be the number of Electronic Signatures given by the Authorized Officer using the Redflex\r\n\r\n* Monthly reports generated by the Redflex Standard Report System, as mentioned in Section 7.8.2 of the AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF FREMONT AND REDFLEX TRAFFIC SYSTEMS, INC. FOR PHOTO RED LIGHT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM (a copy of this agreement is attached to this request for reference)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Doe",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

To manage costs effectively, I kindly ask that you provide an itemized estimate of the anticipated fees prior to fulfilling the request. If certain documents can be excluded to reduce costs, please inform me so that I can make an informed decision on how to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or if specific documents are withheld, please cite the specific statutory exemption that justifies the refusal. Additionally, if certain records are only partially exempt, I request that the non-exempt portions be disclosed after appropriate redaction, as stipulated by the Hawai\u02bbi Uniform Information Practices Act.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for its fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Roberts. He was taken into custody by the Valdosta Police Department on January 23, 2023, after being found asleep behind the wheel at the intersection of West Magnolia Street and N St. Augustine Road around 2:20 AM. Upon waking him, officers observed signs of impairment and discovered Roberts had a handgun. After a brief conversation, Roberts fled the scene on foot and was apprehended shortly after. He was charged with DUI, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, obstruction of an officer, suspended license, and open container. I am requesting the available body-worn camera footage from the responding officers who made contact with Roberts, removed the weapon, and took him into custody following the foot pursuit.\r\n\r\nSuspect\u2019s Name:\r\nLakenry B. Roberts\r\n\r\nType of Crime:\r\nDUI, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, Obstruction, Suspended License, Open Container\r\n\r\nDate of the Arrest:\r\n01/23/2023\r\n\r\nTime of the Arrest:\r\nApproximately 2:20 AM\r\n\r\nLocation of the Arrest:\r\nIntersection of West Magnolia Street and N St. Augustine Road, Valdosta, GA\r\n\r\n\r\nArresting Agency: Valdosta Police Department  (booked in Lowndes County jail)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We are not able to search in a centralized system for all University records (or the records of an entire department such as UCLA police department) to figure out who may be the holder of a certain document or email.\r\n\r\nBecause your request currently lists no names of UCLA staff whose records you specifically seek, we request that you specify UCLA staff names and/or titles. Otherwise, we are not able to conduct a search for records.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Gov. Code \u00a77922.600 (\"Duty to Assist in Formulating Request\"), UCLA is required to assist in identifying responsive records and to provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Rose Terse,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 2025, the City of Medina Police Department received your public records request for the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords related to the department\u2019s Flock Safety system:\r\n\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\n\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period of December 1, 2024, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\n\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period of December 1, 2024, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\n\r\n3. A list of network share settings that include:\r\n\r\n3a. Flock networks shared with me\r\n\r\n3b. Networks that I\u2019m sharing\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in their original electronic, machine readable format. For example, please provide csv or spreadsheet files where applicable. Please do not redirect me to your transparency portal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City was able to provide records for the following:\r\n\r\n* Organization Audit in Flock - released on 6-12-2025\r\n\r\n      3a. Flock networks share with me - released on 5-22-2025\r\n\r\n      3b. Networks that I'm sharing - released on 5-22-2025\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding request #2. Network Audit in Flock, the City has no public records meeting the description.  Our agency did not own, prepare, use, retain, or possess, or access the records that you are requesting and therefore, these are not public records under the State Public Records Act.  To be a \"public record\" under Public Records Act, information must be (1) a writing (2) related to the conduct of government or the performance of government functions that is (3) prepared, owned, used, or retained by a state or local agency.  Here, these records do not meet that criteria.  See Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 880-882 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City has determined that your request has been fulfilled. This is now considered closed. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.550(6), you have one year from the date of this letter to seek judicial review of this request. If you have any questions regarding your request, please respond within twenty (20) days of this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBarbara Marxer\r\n\r\nMedina PD\r\n\r\nRecords\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Medina, WA.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",
