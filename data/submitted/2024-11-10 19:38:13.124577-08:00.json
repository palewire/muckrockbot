Specifically, this grant and sub-award are described on USASpending.gov:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nMy initial FOIA request was rejected with the following text: \"There are no records responsive to your request. There were no technical or research reports for this project.\" See IDA Letter 2025-00131-F. I am sending a copy of this IDA letter to DHA.FOIAappeals@health.mil , as requested in the said letter.\r\n\r\nI want to draw your attention to the fact that $750,000 were paid to Wayne State University by the DOD. This included a sub-award WSU23001 in the amount of  $218,562  to Michigan State University. Sub-award description found on the same USAspending.gov page is as follows:\r\n\r\n'IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #1, WE WILL EXPOSE GYRENCEPHALIC FERRETS (N = 48), WHICH ARE UNLIKE LISSENCEPHALIC ANIMALS (MICE AND RATS), TO RF WAVES FOR TWO HOURS/DAY FOR SIXTY DAYS USING A SOURCE \r\n OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN EXPOSURE PROFILE THAT IS LIKELY COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL RECEIVED. SOME ADDITIONAL ANIMALS (N = 24) WILL RECEIVE SHAM EXPOSURE. IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AN ANIMAL MODEL WITH THE BRAIN STRUCTURES RESEMBLING THE GYRENCEPHALIC NATURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN; MICE AND RATS DO NOT FULFIL THOSE CRITERIA.\r\n \r\n IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #2, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER RF WAVE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, COCHLEAR, OR VESTIBULAR CHANGES AMONG THE FERRETS AFTER TWO MONTHS COMPARED TO SHAM \r\n EXPOSED ANIMALS.\r\n \r\nPROJECT MILESTONES\r\n OUR MILESTONES WILL BE: (1) FULL ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL AT TWO MONTHS; (2) TESTING OF RF WAVE GENERATOR/RECEIVERS BY THE FOURTH MONTH; (3) TESTING COHORTS OF FERRETS [8 FERRETS/MONTH] FOR RF WAVE EXPOSURE WITH BEHAVIORAL, RADIOGRAPHIC, HISTOPATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR ANALYSES BETWEEN FOUR AND \r\n TWELVE MONTHS; (4) FINAL DATA ANALYSES AT ONE YEAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement of rejection issued in the IDA Letter 2025-00131-F doesn't  conform with the information available on the USAspending.gov webpage describing Project Grant FAIN W81XWH2211105 and sub-award WSU23001:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use.

The sub-award in the amount of $218,562 was received by REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN on October 21, 2022 . Detailed sub-award description is found on USASpending.gov: https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\n\"IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #1, WE WILL EXPOSE GYRENCEPHALIC FERRETS (N = 48), WHICH ARE UNLIKE LISSENCEPHALIC ANIMALS (MICE AND RATS), TO RF WAVES FOR TWO HOURS/DAY FOR SIXTY DAYS USING A SOURCE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN EXPOSURE PROFILE THAT IS LIKELY COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL RECEIVED. SOME ADDITIONAL ANIMALS (N = 24) WILL RECEIVE SHAM EXPOSURE. IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AN ANIMAL MODEL WITH THE BRAIN STRUCTURES RESEMBLING THE GYRENCEPHALIC NATURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN; MICE AND RATS DO NOT FULFIL THOSE CRITERIA.\r\n \r\n IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #2, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER RF WAVE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, COCHLEAR, OR VESTIBULAR CHANGES AMONG THE FERRETS AFTER TWO MONTHS COMPARED TO SHAM EXPOSED ANIMALS.\r\n \r\n PROJECT MILESTONES: OUR MILESTONES WILL BE: (1) FULL ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL AT TWO MONTHS; (2) TESTING OF RF WAVE GENERATOR/RECEIVERS BY THE FOURTH MONTH; (3) TESTING COHORTS OF FERRETS [8 FERRETS/MONTH] FOR RF WAVE EXPOSURE WITH BEHAVIORAL, RADIOGRAPHIC, HISTOPATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR ANALYSES BETWEEN FOUR AND \r\n TWELVE MONTHS; (4) FINAL DATA ANALYSES AT ONE YEAR.\"\r\n\r\nDate range for this FOIA request is January 1, 2022 until November 1, 2024.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The grant is listed on USSpending.gov:  https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nThe date range for this FOIA Request must include any documents, memoranda, e-mails, protocols, approvals, reports, technical documentation, financial ledgers and costs from January 1, 2022 until November 1, 2024 associated with said grant.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeonid Ber",

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

As you are aware, Congress created OGIS to\r\nserve as the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Ombudsman. We assist the public and\r\nfederal agencies by helping them resolve their FOIA disputes, and by addressing their questions\r\nand concerns about the FOIA process.\r\nIt appears that you are seeking assistance with a FOIA request currently pending with the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Please note, OGIS cannot compel an agency to\r\nprocess a request more quickly or ahead of others in the queue. However, in working cases\r\nsimilar to yours, we have learned that some requesters have had success receiving a more timely\r\nresponse by refining the scope of a request. If you would like to discuss narrowing your\r\nrequest\u2014which may allow it to be processed more efficiently\u2014 you may wish to contact the\r\nagency's FOIA Public Liaison (FPL). All federal agencies have an FPL, whose role is to explain\r\nthe FOIA process and assist requesters with their FOIA requests at any stage of the\r\nadministrative process.\r\nAdditionally, it is important to know that all federal agencies are required to provide an estimated\r\ndate of completion (EDC) when asked (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii)). In order to obtain an\r\nestimated date of completion for your request, we recommend that you contact the agency\r\ndirectly. The FOIA Public Liaison (FPL) for the Civil Rights Division, April Freeman, can be\r\nreached at 202-514-4210.\r\nWe hope you find this information useful. At this time, we will take no further action. If you\r\nhave questions or concerns that we have not addressed, please contact us again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nThe OGIS Staff\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

        "communication": "Dear Avery Farmer, Thank you for your interest in public records of City of Boston. Your request has been received and is being processed. Your request was received in this office on 11/7/2024 9:54:21 PM and given the reference number R004626-110724 for tracking purposes. To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M.G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\u2022 A school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\u2022 A referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is for the school years 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25, up to and including the day the records are produced. The scope of the request is the Mel H. King Academy South End Academy, formerly known as the McKinley schools, including all records for the following schools:\r\n\u2022 Elementary: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116.\r\n\u2022 K-12 Academy: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116.\r\n\u2022 Middle: 50 St. Mary\u2019s Street, Boston, MA 02215.\r\n\u2022 Prep: 97 Peterborough Street, Boston, MA 02115.\r\nThroughout this request, \u201cSchool\u201d refers to all of the schools described above. \u201cSchool-related arrest\u201d refers to \u201can arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the School and time period described above, I request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement.\r\n2. Specifically, I request a database extract including the following variables:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges) including the statute governing the alleged offense\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n3. If a database extract as described in bullets 1\u20132 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement.\r\n4. The total number and a brief description of 911 calls from the School that were made to local police departments.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). Moreover, for municipalities with a population of over 20,000, the first two hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record may not be charged a fee. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M.G.L. c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt.

Disclosure will directly benefit public understanding and support governmental accountability.

Please notify me promptly if clarifications or additional processing time are needed. Contact me exclusively at AabiWR@live.com.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for This Request\r\nThis request and appeal are grounded in the following statutes:\r\n\r\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (Federal FOIA) \u2013 Governing the public\u2019s right to access federal records.\r\nConnecticut FOIA (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242) \u2013 Requiring prompt, transparent access to state records.\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) \u2013 Ensuring reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) \u2013 Mandating equal access and accommodation for individuals with disabilities in federally funded programs.\r\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.

        "communication": "Subject: FOIA Appeal for OCR Transaction Number 01-25-592844 \u2013 ADA Non-Compliance, Obstruction, and Demand for Comprehensive Disclosure\r\n\r\nTo: FOIA Appeals Officer, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\nDate: November 8, 2024\r\n\r\nAppeal of FOIA Response \u2013 Incomplete Compliance with ADA Requirements and FOIA Standards\r\n\r\nI am filing a formal appeal regarding CMS\u2019s inadequate handling of my FOIA request related to OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844. CMS has not complied with ADA-mandated accommodations, failed to conduct a transparent FOIA process, and imposed unnecessary procedural barriers, which hinder public transparency and accessibility.\r\n\r\nBackground and Key Individuals Involved\r\nMy initial FOIA request was submitted to the CMS FOIA Division, OSORA, Division of FOIA Analysis \u2013 A. In response, I received communication from Doris Davis, Government Information Specialist (email: doris.davis@cms.hhs.gov, phone: +1 410-786-5915), redirecting my request to FOIA_Request@cms.hhs.gov. This redirection, rather than transparent processing, has delayed and obstructed access to requested records.\r\n\r\nFurther involved personnel include:\r\n\r\nKaren Jackson, Deputy Director, CMS OSORA, Division of FOIA Analysis, and\r\nMary E. Greene, Director of the Office of Strategic Operations and Regulatory Affairs, who is accountable for CMS\u2019s FOIA compliance and ADA accessibility.\r\nLegal Violations and Procedural Failures\r\n1. Non-Compliance with ADA Standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\nCMS\u2019s refusal to provide my requested ADA accommodations constitutes a clear violation of the ADA and Section 504. These statutes require federal agencies to make reasonable accommodations to ensure individuals with disabilities have equal access. CMS\u2019s imposition of procedural barriers and refusal to honor my accommodation requests amounts to a discriminatory denial of access to public records.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C))\r\nFOIA mandates a \u201creasonable search\u201d designed to locate all relevant documents (see Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). CMS has not demonstrated a complete search across the relevant CMS divisions and OCR, nor provided assurance that all records have been examined. This is a failure to fulfill FOIA\u2019s basic requirements.\r\n\r\n3. Obstructive Referral to Non-transparent Channels\r\nRedirecting my FOIA request to a separate email creates an unjustified procedural barrier, delaying and obscuring access. FOIA requires agencies to respond promptly and transparently, not to redirect or impose indirect channels that hinder access. CMS\u2019s actions impede my ability to monitor and engage in the FOIA process fully.\r\n\r\n4. Failure to Meet FOIA\u2019s Public Access Requirements (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA exists to facilitate public access to government records. CMS\u2019s denial of accessible formats and unnecessary referral practices runs contrary to FOIA\u2019s goal of transparency, especially for individuals requiring disability accommodations.\r\n\r\nCorrective Actions Demanded\r\nTo address these statutory and procedural violations, I formally demand the following actions to ensure ADA and FOIA compliance:\r\n\r\n1. Direct Processing of FOIA Request with ADA Accommodations\r\nCMS must process my FOIA request (OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844) directly, honoring the following ADA-required accommodations:\r\n\r\nExclusive Email Communication to AabiWR@live.com.\r\nScreen Reader-Compatible PDF Formatting with files labeled by category and date.\r\n2. Comprehensive Search Confirmation Across CMS Divisions and OCR\r\nI request written confirmation that CMS has conducted a thorough and complete search of all records related to ADA compliance and civil rights complaints across all relevant departments, including OSORA and OCR.\r\n\r\n3. Verification of Contacts with Accountability and Oversight\r\nPlease provide the names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisors responsible for this FOIA request. Required individuals include:\r\n\r\nDoris Davis, Government Information Specialist, CMS FOIA Division\r\nKaren Jackson, Deputy Director, OSORA, Division of FOIA Analysis\r\nMary E. Greene, Director, OSORA, CMS\r\n4. Detailed Justification for Withheld or Redacted Records\r\nFor any records withheld or redacted, I require a detailed explanation citing specific FOIA exemptions. Please also include a summary of withheld content to maintain transparency and adhere to ADA requirements.\r\n\r\n5. Immediate Confirmation of ADA-Compliant Procedures\r\nConfirm in writing that CMS will adhere to my ADA-required accommodations in all future responses, specifically exclusive email communication and accessible PDF formatting.\r\n\r\nConclusion and Escalation Notification\r\nCMS\u2019s actions reveal a troubling disregard for both FOIA and ADA standards, impacting individuals with disabilities\u2019 access to public records and agency accountability. If these issues are not promptly resolved through the corrective actions outlined, I will escalate this matter to the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and additional federal oversight bodies.\r\n\r\nI request acknowledgment of this appeal and a timeline for implementing these corrective actions within 20 business days, as required by FOIA.\r\n\r\nThank you for addressing this critical legal matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\nNovember 8, 2024",

Case Handling and Decision-Making Documentation\r\nInternal and external case reports, status updates, decision-making logs, case processing logs, workflow charts, and progress reports specific to OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844.\r\nDetailed descriptions and timelines for each action taken, including explanations for any delays, incomplete responses, or procedural omissions related to this case.\r\nRecords outlining guidance documents and internal policies referenced in processing OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844, particularly ADA, FOIA, and civil rights compliance guidelines.\r\n\r\n4. Contracts, Agreements, and Financial Records\r\nAny contracts, agreements, MOUs, or financial transactions relevant to OCR\u2019s engagement with external consultants or resources in relation to my case.\r\nRecords reflecting financial allocations and expenditures applied to the investigation, management, or oversight of OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844, including budgets for ADA compliance and civil rights enforcement.\r\n\r\n5. Policy and Procedural Documentation\r\nComplete internal policies, procedural guidelines, and compliance standards related to OCR\u2019s handling of ADA complaints, civil rights compliance, whistleblower protections, and procedural integrity.\r\nOCR\u2019s guidelines and directives for ADA accommodation and compliance processing, especially regarding brain injury survivors, Medicaid consumer protections, and the handling of complex FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n6.

Audit Findings, Compliance Reviews, and Corrective Action Records\r\nInternal or third-party audit findings, compliance reviews, and corrective action plans related to the procedural handling of ADA complaints, FOIA administration, and whistleblower protections, particularly those affecting OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844.\r\nDocumentation of federal or state compliance investigations or oversight reports relevant to OCR\u2019s ADA and civil rights compliance responsibilities.\r\n\r\n9. FOIA Compliance and Denials, Redactions, and Justifications\r\nDocumentation of any previous FOIA responses, denials, redactions, and exemptions applied to my requests concerning OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844.\r\nFor any redactions, I request a clear explanation, including specific legal exemptions cited, justifications, and summaries of withheld content to maintain transparency and accessibility.\r\n\r\nAccommodation Requirements for Compliance\r\nTo ensure that all records are accessible and ADA-compliant, please apply the following accommodations consistently:\r\n\r\nExclusive Email-Only Communication:\r\nSend all responses, records, and updates exclusively via email to AabiWR@live.com. Do not use physical mail, phone calls, portal-based communications, or any external links. This ensures uninterrupted and barrier-free access to information.\r\n\r\nAccessible Document Formatting:\r\nInclude the full text of each response within the email body, and attach all supporting documents as labeled PDFs, organized by category and date.\r\nEnsure documents are screen reader-compatible to maintain accessibility.\r\n\r\nClear Justifications for Redactions and Denials:\r\nFor any withheld or redacted records, provide a complete justification, including specific statutes or legal exemptions. Include a summary of redacted content wherever feasible.\r\n\r\nIdentification of Responsible FOIA Officers and Supervisory Personnel:\r\nProvide the full names, titles, email addresses, and phone numbers of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, or supervisors handling this request.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the significance of OCR Transaction Number: 01-25-592844 and the public interest in ADA compliance, civil rights enforcement, and procedural integrity within DSS and CHRO, I request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Delayed access to these records obstructs effective oversight and hinders efforts to protect vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nJustification for Fee Waiver\r\nThis request seeks information critical to the public interest regarding ADA enforcement, civil rights protections, and DSS\u2019s handling of Medicaid-related complaints. Disclosure will directly benefit public understanding and support governmental accountability. Therefore, I request a waiver of all associated fees, as this request is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nTimeline for Response\r\nUnder FOIA, I request acknowledgment within the statutory timeframe, along with a timeline for compliance. Please notify me promptly if clarifications or additional processing time are needed. Contact me exclusively at AabiWR@live.com.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for This Request\r\nThis request and appeal are grounded in the following statutes:\r\n\r\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (Federal FOIA) \u2013 Governing the public\u2019s right to access federal records.\r\nConnecticut FOIA (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242) \u2013 Requiring prompt, transparent access to state records.\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) \u2013 Ensuring reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) \u2013 Mandating equal access and accommodation for individuals with disabilities in federally funded programs.\r\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. Full and prompt disclosure of these records is crucial for ensuring transparency, ADA compliance, and public accountability within the government\u2019s handling of ADA-related complaints and civil rights protections.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
