Similarly, I would prefer records that contain this information reported as counts (totals), but if such records are unavailable, records reporting the same information by percent (percent of total) would be acceptable. I would also prefer the information be sent via email in PDF format, but would accept other electronic formats. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $25. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document. \r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial, including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWendy Sawyer",
