Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",

See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11007418/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870381/\r\n3. Deaths in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread, ongoing media coverage and extensive policy advocacy and discussion. See, e.g. ,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211316303/ice-releases-investigation-into-immigrants-death-after-months-of-inexcusable-del; https://www.yahoo.com/news/number-deaths-ice-custody-already-133000592.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALCThkPLfU2ufNLo_I3yqmeUO38qEyUSI4U597M71FTc3npyfor0xVw-REfCt-2anUv5517ufGPQZZuU4KKiJ98axkk_ivGQf5e9Gu_gYZaHzjunplOd3-7tEQTfDoPBn6g0zjNvYt8aKSYJBBN9iLv2gvnes6k94yMIMemD-0yw; https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/us/migrant-death-ice-custody-recommended-release/index.html.\r\n4. There exist serious questions regarding the government's capacity to ensure safe and humane detention conditions that prevent deaths in ICE custody, based on available FOIA records obtained through federal litigation.  See, e.g., https://prismreports.org/2023/04/20/ice-gourgan-mirimanian-death-2018/; https://today.usc.edu/ice-deaths-custody-detention-medical-standards-violated-usc-study/\r\n5. ICE has announced its intention to expand its detention system, potentially increasing the numbers of in-custody death to even higher levels. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-announces-ongoing-work-optimize-enforcement-resources\r\n6. ICE has previously failed to accurately inform the public of its own internal agency conclusions about the events leading up to in-custody deaths. See, e.g., https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/April-2024-ACLU-Letter-to-ICE-on-Torrance-Detention-Facility.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is a compelling need to obtain these records as soon as possible so that the public can understand the consequences of ICE's current detention management processes as the agency seeks to expand the system beyond its appropriated limit of 41,500 beds.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nNOTICE RE: EXEMPT RECORDS \u2014 INVESTIGATIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for making a request for records from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department (Department).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d) has concluded its review of the Public Records Act request, wherein you seek: \u201cthe log of CSS uses or disaggregated data showing the number of times the agency used its CSS.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDepartment records indicate that, year to date, a cell site simulator has been deployed 208 times. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the cell site simulator log contains confidential and investigative information. This material is exempt from disclosure. Government Code section 7923.600, subdivision (a) exempts from California Public Records Act disclosure \u201cany investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes.\u201d These records are exempt from disclosure, even if the prospect of enforcement proceedings is not concrete and definite. (Haynie v. Superior Court (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061,1069; Black Panther Party v. Kehoe (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 654; Younger v. Berkeley City Council (1st Dist. 1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 825, 833; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440.) The records remain protected from disclosure even after an investigation has concluded. (Williams v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 355\u2013362.) Further, the release of such records could violate the privacy rights of involved parties. The California Public Records Act recognizes that the right to privacy is a fundamental interest that the California Constitution protects. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7927.700 and 7927.705.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe this determination is in error, or if you have further information that you wish to provide to us regarding your request, kindly re-submit your request either in person at any Sheriff\u2019s Department station, through our online portal: https://sanbernardinocounty.nextrequest.com/. Please note that, in addition to visiting one of the Department\u2019s stations to make an in-person request for records, you are also welcome to use the portal or email for any future records requests you may have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to review the Department\u2019s Records Request Guidelines (CPRA) and/or the Department\u2019s California Public Records Act FAQs information on our website at: https://wp.sbcounty.gov/sheriff/divisions/information-services/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for making a request for records from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at San Bernardino County.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Pineda from January 1, 2022 to the present that include any of the following keywords: \"housing\", \"TDY\", \u201cWarfighter\", \"furniture\", \"lodging\" \"per diem\" \"DMC\", \"C2\", \"Kennith\", Ken\", \"Clark\" \"KW\", \"CM\u201d, \u201cWF\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request encompasses all forms of communication, including but not limited to emails, letters, memos, and any other written correspondence.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search for these records, please include any correspondence where  Lauretta A. Pineda is either the sender or recipient, and the specified keywords appear in the subject line, body, or attachments of the communications.\r\n\r\nI am an independent researcher investigating how housing allowances issued to service members on temporary duty status (TDY) are being used. This includes any formal or informal relationships between unit commanders/leadership and commercial housing providers, to include how leadership may be directing SMs to specific commercial providers and what incentives are being offered to do so. The purpose of my project is for developing a better understanding of how the government works after authorizing housing allowances to SMs on temporary duty status (TDY), what controls are in place at the unit level, and what protocols are in place ensure taxpayer funded housing allowances are used as authorized.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of my research will be to produce a series of web-based essays using primary sources obtained by my FOIA requests. This final work product will be released with the aim of educating the public on the importance of temporary duty status (TDY) travel and the safeguards in place to protect against the potential for abuse.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid C",
