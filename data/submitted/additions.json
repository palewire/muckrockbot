        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to David Richmond Gergen. He was born on 9 May 1942 in Durham, North Carolina, USA and died on 10 July 2025.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\nDavid Gergen was a Washington, D.C. political insider who served in four presidential administrations. \r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\n\r\nAttached is Mr. Gergen's obituary from the Associated Press.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center and the Central Records Complex (CRC) in Winchester/Frederick County, Virginia. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, please produce all records related to the transfer or destruction. If previously-released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. If you nonetheless decide to charge me fees, please inform me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your processing of this request.",
