Specifically this is a request for any presentations created for, or delivered to, members of the Presidential Transition Team for the new Administration (2nd Trump term) in November and December 2024. Please include any materials (documents, Excel files, PowerPoint presentations, audio/visual) from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (or \"PCAST\") which is under the umbrella of the Office of Science of Technology Policy. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is information related to pandemic planning or deliberations related to executive branch planning for the responses to the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV, Monkeypox, COVID-19, West Nile virus, Coxsackie, H1N1, etc. \r\n\r\nAccording to several books and much media coverage, President Trump claimed at the outset of the COVID-19 that there was no nearly no documentation or planning shared during the 2016/2017 transition related to pandemic planning, while members of the Obama administration have publicly claimed that OSTP pandemic planning documents were ignored. Any documents related to the efficacy of the Biden administration's response to Monkeypox or Covid-19 or HIV would be of particular interest. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Office of Science and Technology Policy's commitment to transparency. The release of these documents would be of a great public benefit in understanding the pandemic and the public health challenges we face.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
