The City needs additional time to locate and assemble the records requested and to determine whether any of the requested records are exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request.  For these reasons, I estimate that the City will need approximately 4 weeks in order to respond to your request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the police department may also exercise its right to provide the responsive records in installments as they become available. \r\n\r\nYou may contact Police Records at (360) 778-8700 if you have any questions about this request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nBellingham Police Records Division",
